We're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and I guess we'll be going back to the apartment together? Hilary: Yeah, I guess so Daniel: I'm with Hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me Benjamin: Hmm I might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday Hilary: Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off) Benjamin: YAAAAWN ðŸ™Š Where and where are you meeting? Hilary: So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen Benjamin: Interesting ðŸ˜± To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear Hilary: Oh come on ðŸ˜‚ Benjamin: All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take Hilary: We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research. Oh wait, no, I'm actually meeting them because I wanted to chat about their research lol Elliot: ðŸ™‰ Hilary: Do join us, we're going to have fun. And then you'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps Elliot: Sounds like a plan ðŸ˜‚ Hilary: ðŸ˜Ž Elliot: See you at 2 then xx
