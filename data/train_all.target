You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness.
What do you mean? It will help us to relax.
Do you really think so? I don't. It will just make us fat and act silly. Remember last time?
I guess you are right. But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.
I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.
That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.
Sounds great to me! If they are willing, We could ask them to go dancing with us. That is excellent exercise and fun, Too.
Good. Let's go now.
All right.
Of course I can. It's a piece of cake! Believe it or not, I can do 30 push-ups a minute.
Really? I think that's impossible!
You mean 30 push-ups?
Yeah!
It's easy. If you do exercise everyday, You can make it, Too.
No, I listen to background music.
What is the difference?
The radio has too many comerials.
That's true, But then you have to buy a record player.
I will be all right soon. I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire.
Don't worry. He is an acrobat。.
I see.
Yeah, I just got them. I started playing ice hockey in a community league. So, I finally got myself new skates.
What position do you play?
I'm a defender. It's a lot of fun. You don't have to be able to skate as fast on defense.
Yeah, You're a pretty big guy. I play goalie, Myself.
Oh, Yeah? Which team?
The Rockets.
Really? I think we play you guys next week. Well, I have to go to practice. See you later.
All right, See you later.
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, And that I will have a passionate summer fling!
What are you talking about? Let me see that... What are horoscopes?
It's a prediction of your month, Based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, So I'm an Aries. When were you born?
January 5th.
Let's see... You're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, But you could see new, Exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting summers!
That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, And my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.
No, It's not, Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.
Well, You certainly match those criteria, But they're so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?
A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you!
Is he really?
Yes, He is. He loves the girl very much.
Who is he marring?
A girl he met on holiday in Spain, I think.
Have they set a date for the wedding?
Not yet.
That's right, We bought it the same day we came on the market.
What kind of house is it?
It's a wonderful Spanish style.
Oh, I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses.
And it's a bargaining. A house like this in river side costs double the price.
Great, Is it a two bedroom house?
No, It has three bedrooms and three beds, And has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. There's a two-car garage.
That's a nice area too. It'll be a good investment for you.
Yeas, When will you buy a house?
Not untill the end of this year, You know, Just before my wedding.
Right, Congratulations.
Thank you.
Not much, Except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall.
What's the problem?
She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she's around.
For example?
Well, Last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, But if you listened to her, Then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her.
No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen.
It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids.
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, Then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, The schools we sent them too, And everything else under the sun.
You said she used to? How did you stop her?
We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing, And how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things. She understood, And now everything is a lot more peaceful.
That sounds like a good idea. I'll have to try that.
I hate to admit it, But they're good. And fast. The Filipino kid is a genius.
So you'll make the Stars. Com deadline, And have us up and running next week?
It'll be close, But we'll make it.
Good. After Stars. Com starts paying us, We won't need Vikam's cash anymore.
And if we don't need them, We won't need Zina, Either.
Yes. I like cooking very much. I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold.
Why do you like it?
I have no idea. I like cooking by myself. I like to taste delicious food.
That's wonderful!
And I love trying new recipes, Which I usually test with my friends. You can come, Too.
Really? I hope I can have a chance to taste it. Don't forget to tell me.
Certainly.
I'm in the kitchen... Let yourself in!
Wow! You're really working up a storm!
I know. I've even worked up a sweat.
You look like a cooking show host--only messier.
Thanks. I just got back from summer camp.
How was it?
Great. I got to try so many things for the first time.
Like what?
I went sailing, Fishing, And horseback riding.
I'm so jealous.
The counselors were so nice too. It was the best summer ever. Except for all those mosquitoes!
It's good. But to tell you the truth, I don't wear perfume.
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
That's all right. Thank you all the same.
All right, Bill. Here's your daily exercise schedule. You are to jog before breakfast.
Jog?
Then, You are to walk to work.
Walk?
Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time.
Oh no.
Use the stairs, Never the elevator.
Oh, Dear.
And three times a week, You can either swim, Play racketball, Or hand ball.
Oh no.
Ok, You can stop now. It's time for the dance class.
Dance class! I don't know how.
You will.
Oh...
Oh where was that?
I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track.
Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy. She is always making us kids eat the proper foods.
Well, It pays off for her. How old is she anyway?
She will be 86 next month.
That is truly amazing!
No problem, What class would you like to take?
I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class. Because I'm crazy.
There are two classes that are still open.
Which days are these classes on?
The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three.
What about the other class?
The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12.
Are you sure there are no more open classes?
I'm positive.
Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday.
Okay, I'll sign you up.
Honey, A typhoon is coming.
Really? Wow, I don't have to go to school tomorrow.
Jenny, Come and help, We need to prepare more food.
Ok. Dad! I'm coming.
Nice to meet you, Lean. My name is Alike. I'm from Japan.
To me English is a difficult language.
A second language is always difficult.
True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.
A crazy language? Why do you say that?
One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.
No wonder you say English is a crazy language.
I hope so. I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing, And I'm not quite sure where to look.
I'll certainly try to help you. What topic is your paper on?
My paper is on the influence of television on children.
There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television.
Thank you for you help.
Yeah, Cal Ripen just hit a home run.
What's the score?
Well it was 3 to 4, But Ripen's home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base.
So Baltimore is winning?
Right.
This is a really great place to watch a baseball game.
Yeah, There isn't a bad seat in the place.
The fans are great here, Too. Not like in Philadelphia.
It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game.
Yeah, It reminds you why they say baseball is America's favorite pastime.
Perfect. It really hits the spot.
Sorry, I don't smoke.
Were you? Your performance was excellent.
Thank you for your kindly words.
Sure. Which button do I press to shoot?
This one.
Do I have to focus it?
No, This is a focus-free camera. All you have to do is point and press the button.
All right. Say cheese!
Yeah, We don't live in the vacuum. We have traditional values and long but different history.
Sometimes, We, Human beings, Really had done something wrong, So we should admit it at first.
But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history.
I believe such things won't be realized, Just daydreaming.
I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance. But I don't like traveling to work, Waiting for buses, Or...
Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you're driving.
Exactly.
I do wish I could afford one.
You can get a loan from the bank. You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases.
Of course I know that. But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing?
How do you do, Ms. Yang. You speak very good English.
Thank you. I begin to like English even when I was a child.
Where did you learn it?
At school, In China. This is my first time to be out of my own country.
It's amazing.
White, Please.
Look! There's a Folk concert tomorrow evening. Do you Want to go?
I don't like Folk music very much.
What kind of music do you like?
I like classical music. Do you?
Not very much. Classical music sends me to sleep.
I don't believe you.
It's true.
You are funny!
So are you! How about another coffee?
I like playing chess.
Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess?
I'm afraid not.
Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that?
Oh, Yes. I like playing basketball.
Can you tell me why you like it?
Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others.
Haven't you heard that he is in prison?
What? Beg your pardon.
John is in prison now. He was copped outstealing.
I just cann't believe my ears!
I hope so. I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing, And I'm not quite sure where to look.
I'll certainly try to help you. What topic is your paper on?
My paper is on the influence of television on children.
There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television.
Thank you for you help.
Well, I have the day off from work.
That's great! Do you have any plans?
Well, I'Ve been working so hard lately, So I'll probably just take it easy.
Sounds nice.
Yeah, I'll probably just stay in and relax. Maybe watch a few movies.
Can I stop by?
Sure. Any time.
Yes, I do. I think that science is making us wiser. What do you think?
I don't think you're right there.
I believe industry is making us wealthier.
I don't believe that.
And in my opinion, Medicine is making us healthier.
I agree with you in the sense. But we're all more miserable than ever, Aren't we?
I don't agree with you. I maintain that we're healthier, Wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago.
That's your opinion not mine.
I want to have a picnic with my friends, Mum.
How about a party at home? That way we can get together and celebrate it.
Ok, Mum. I'll invite my friends home.
I would like to return this book.
Is that all you need?
I also want to check out this video.
Is that all you would like to check out?
That's all I need.
Do you have your library card?
Here it is.
Make sure to take proper care of this video.
That won't be a problem.
If you damage the video, You will be fined.
I won't damage it.
It's us.
What do you mean by us.
Well, You always say you're busy.
That's right.
And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself.
I... I... I miss my parents, Also they miss me.
Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, And you didn't say anything about it.
You mean I am groaned a few words?
Totally not. Perhaps it's about our marriage.
I think I've caught a cold. Now I'm aching all over.
You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest. I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon.
Thank you. I suppose I should go to see a doctor.
Great idea! Peter, I could use the drink.
How about the new bar across road?
Sounds good. The food there is fantastic, Too.
I agree, I had lunch there last week.
Excellent! That sounds like a plan.
Well. My watch says five past two. But it's no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days.
You have to go and fix it.
Yes. I will.
Sure. My mom has been working on our family tree for years. She's always updating it.
Do you have a copy of your family tree in your house? I'd love to see it.
I can show it to you now, If you like. I think it goes back about 8 generations so far.
That's amazing. Do you have a large extended family?
I'Ve got 30 cousins on my mom's side and 10 cousins on my dad's side.
Are you very close to your first-cousins?
The ones that are my age are close relatives. Now that I'm older, I don't spend as much time with them as I used to, So I don't know my younger cousins as well as the older ones.
I see. Who's the head of your household?
It's definitely my mother. And, Her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family.
That's interesting. What does your grandfather think of your step-mother?
At first, She was quite critical of her, But now that they'Ve been married for a few years, She's starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother.
That's pretty much how you feel about your step-mother. Like grandmother, Like grandson.
Sounds interesting, I haven't gone boating for some time now, And what time?
How about tomorrow afternoon?
Sure. Where shall I meet you?
At the gate of the park.
Great. I look forward to meeting you.
See you then.
See you.
Yes, It's so exciting, Though I had the most falls in our skiing team.
Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski?
Of course there is. The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration.
Could you move smoothly?
Yes. My face even ached in the icy wind.
What happened afterwards?
I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop! You can just imagine how terrified I was.
Poor girl!
Yeah. I have got much pressure in the company. I have tobe wrapped upon my work.
Take good care of yourself.
Thank you. I will.
About David? No, I didn't hear anything.
You know, About David and his new boss.
Sorry, I don't quite follow you.
Well, I heard David has been fired.
Oh, That is a shame. He is really hard working.
I usually ride my bike. Which form of transport do you prefer to use?
I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle, But when I feel lazy, I drive my car.
I think we should discourage people from using their private cars. They produce too much pollution!
I agree, But I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient.
Cars might be convenient, But they're so bad for the environment.
Do you have a car?
No. I used to have one though. Once I started using my bicycle to get around, I found that I didn't really need it.
Maybe if I sold my car now, I wouldn't be so tempted to use it.
You could try. It would save you a lot of money.
That's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, Insurance, And repairs.
If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, You will get lots of exercise, Too!
I could stand to lose a few pounds. Having a car has made me lazy. I never end up walking anywhere!
Let's go to a car dealership. I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price.
Sounds good! Let's go!
His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party.
Study, Study, Study. I want to learn a lot.
You are going to take courses?
Yes. I am going to take some university courses there.
Sounds hard.
Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.
Won't you get lonely?
Hey, I am a pretty cool guy. I will make friends, And I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too. You know, Like fencing, Or theater or something.
Well, Do you think I have to?
I do. We haven't watered them for quite a few days.
Please look at the sky. Don't you see the dark clouds? It's going to rain soon.
Good. So we don't have to work. How nice!
But I don't think it's so nice.
Why?
The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week.
Oh, I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain.
Yeah, This one closes at ten. We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth.
Alright. We are out of everything.
I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day.
I know, Our schedules are so weird. Sometimes, The little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that's open when we get home.
Yeah, And the prices there are very high.
I know. Three dollars for milk.
You can count on it.
I think so. Yes, They get along so well.
I like him. He's good for her.
You're right. He sure is.
First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink. Then we will visit the University Museum.
Where are we going to have a drink?
There is a coffee shop round the corner. Can you see that big building at the end of the road?
Yes?
That is a bank. The coffee shop is opposite the bank.
Good. I will have hot chocolate.
A stop! Wait for the lights to turn green.
When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you.
Sorry. How far is the museum?
I am not sure. We will ask for directions in the coffee shop.
Here we are. You find us a table and I'll get the drinks.
That's great. What's on tonight?
I am not sure about the name of the film, But I know it's a romantic one.
Romantic? I am afraid I like thrillers better.
Don't you think it's too bloody?
On the contrary, Very exciting.
Are you sick?
No. The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard. It set my teeth on edge.
He'll finish writing in a minute.
Really? Are you sure?
Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.
Yeah but, It is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!
Really?
Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.
Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, Find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, And that the place is hygienic.
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!
It's a portable TV. It's a popular thing now.
Oh, That's new to me. So what's on everyday?
News about current affairs, Documentaries, Music, Movies, Noncommercial ads and so on.
Is there anything interesting?
Yes, There are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education.
I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV?
Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs.
That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well?
Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals.
I got it. Do you pay for the programs?
Yes, 50 Yuan per month.
How dreadful!
Look at the view from the window.
Oh, Dear. That's terrible. Not at all what I expected.
It's awful, Isn't it?
I can't bear to look at it. I'm rather disappointed.
It can't be helped.
Well, I like playing the violin.
Really? How long have you been playing the violin?
About ten years so far. I started learning when I was in middle school.
That's really interesting.
Sure. So what about you? Do you have any hobbies?
Well, I like collecting matchbox! I'm not sure if that counts, Though.
Of course it does. Everybody has his own hobby.
Don't worry, You'll find a way.
There is no need to be so frustrated.
How can you live without job in the future?
Don't worry, You'll find a way.
I like baseball and basketball.
How about football?
In my country football is brand new, So I never learned the game when I was younger.
It's a very popular game in America.
Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?
For me, It's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.
Are you a football player?
No, I just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We're too old to play tackle football.
What is two hand touch and flag football?
Instead of tackling somebody, You just have to touch them with two hands, Or if it is flag football, Grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing.
I see. It's safer then right?
Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, You're welcome to join us.
I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together.
Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning.
Great.
My parents called. As usual, They reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s. Easier said then done. Who should I marry? I have no time to go on a date.
It is not your mother finding one for you?
I will find one myself, Of course. I'm a modern girl.
Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, The latest type.
You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea.
No, There is an updated virgin, Three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, You can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes.
I don't think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time.
I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, So-called love at first sight.
Anyway, I don't want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that.
Don't worry. There are many other options using the internet as dating methods. Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications. Of course, For these sites, You have to pay a membership fee. But all in all, It is more serious and professional. The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher.
I don't want to post my personal information on the internet. I'm not knowing who is reading it.
I was thinking about it. Are you?
Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun.
Really? Well, What time does it start?
It starts at 8.
Well, Who all is going to be there?
Everyone from school.
How do you know it's going to be so fun?
This party is going to have a DJ, Food, And drinks.
Wow, That does sound like it's going to be fun.
So am I going to see you at the party?
Yeah, I will be there.
Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?
Am I failing?
Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?
I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.
I can see that you are trying, But where do you think you could improve?
I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis.
Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, Right?
I'll try ; it's hard!
Thanks for stopping by!
Thanks.
What happened? Quarrel again?
Will you take my materials back from him for me? Please!
Don't ask me. I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel.
What? What did you buy?
It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it!
What is it? Why did you buy a brick?
There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick.
And?
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.
And it's a brick?
Yes.
I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?
I wanted to. But he said, No, The box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, Other people won't believe it's new.
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.
Yes, It was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products. Look, It even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?
He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.
Aha! Now I understand. You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk. So, What I think is, You deserve to get cheated!
C'mon, Don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it. We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.
That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.
You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it. How could I fall for such a trick?
I'm afraid it gains a little.
By how many minutes?
Two.
Just so so. Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time, So we decided to meet again tonight.
Oh, That's exciting. What does this guy look like? Is he hot?
Well, I didn't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! And we have so much in common. We like the same team, Music, And most amazingly, We both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.
It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?
There's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, But when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends.
Well, That's something I've never heard of. But if you ask me what I value most in a friend, I would say honesty.
I agree. You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person. Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need.
Yeah, I know. A friend in need is a friend indeed. I don't need fair-weather friends either.
Yeah, My head hurts, That's all. I'Ve been in physics class all day. It's killer!
I liked physics. It's all math, Really. Arcs, Curves, Velocity, Cool stuff.
Yeah, Yeah, But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.
A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.
It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.
Turtles? Whatever... Look, All that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, That's what the math says.
Math, Sheath. What's the evidence?
There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, Thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, The Big Bang... DuH!
Anyway, It's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that?
Dude, Don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, Didn't you?
I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning.
Does that mean studying all the time?
I don't think so. I think it's about your attitude towards learning. One should be open to new ideas, Decisions, Skills or behaviors.
Then the axiom - 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks' doesn't work any longer.
You're right. Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts.
Yes, I agree with you. When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active.
Me too. To keep up with the changing world, One must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things.
You know what? I've recently been teaching myself French.
Really? That's great! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France.
Yes, So I want to learn French to develop my career.
Nine... But I'll be ten on May 1st. When is your birthday?
I'm older than you! I'll be ten on April 14th.
Are you going to have a birthday party?
Maybe. I'll have to ask my mother.
Hi honey! What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face?
What's wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking.
No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!
Look, There are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, Or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before.
I know, I know. I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?
Fine! I want a divorce!
It's freezing.
I get antsy not because you praise a guy, But because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him.
How come you think of him that way?
Because you seem to have lost your vigilance. You should be on the watch out.
I have no reason to distrust him. He's never caused any harm.
Isn't there anything that sounds fishy?
Nothing smells a rat. I told you that he's an all-right guy.
All-right guy? All right. Let's talk about something else instead.
I think so. Maybe that's why it's cheap here.
Sure, I have. Will you join?
I will. You know, As a newcomer, I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere.
You are right. Our company's Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking.
I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.
No, It will not be formal at all. It is a fun time. You will love the game show. Please dress casually. Usually there is an over abandon of drinks, So be careful with that.
Don't worry, I can handle that. And I know if the boss is there, Even it is an informal evening, It does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him.
I hope not. Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game.
The tall one? Sure, That's Drive, He works with Lily.
He is cute. What dose he do?
I'm not sure, He is a manager I think.
Really? Are you going to introduce us?
Well, He has already taken you know, That's his wife right there.
I'm sorry to have made you disappointed.
That's all right. But why were you so rude to me at lunch.
Was I? Sorry, I didn't mean to be. I do apologize.
And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?
Forgive me darling. I'm very tired.
Yes, I did. But I feel tired today.
Really? Why?
Well, On Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis. Then on Sunday I hiked in the country.
And I bet you studied, Too.
Yeah. I studied on Sunday evening. What about you?
Well, I didn't clean the house and I didn't study. I stayed in bed and watched TV.
That sounds like fun, But did you exercise?
Sort of. I played golf on my computer!
What's the route?
From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank.
If only I could join it!
Oh, Dear.
You must have realized somebody was here.
Oh, Well, I looked around. There wasn't any other space. I waited a while and nobody came. I'm sorry if I've taken your place.
I'm not sure, But probably about 75 years. How about in your country?
About 70, I think. This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population. It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world.
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, Because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly.
Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.
Did she? That's great. However, If we have too many children, That will have a bad effect on the enviroment.
How's your son these days?
Oh, He's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays.
He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child?
I had mine when I was 24. That's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., Or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.
Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, But not just yet.
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country?
Yes, There is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, Have fun, And explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, But they don't often succeed.
Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.
It's almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, Kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, They might go wild.
Have you ever been to America?
No, But I'd really like to.
You'd like it.
Julie! It's good to see you again. How have you been?
Great. I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand.
Really? How was it?
Fantastic! I didn't want to come back.
I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful.
They are. And not only that the people are friendly, But also the food is delicious, Not to mention cheap.
I do like Thai food. Did you see much of Bangkok?
Not much. I've got enough city life in Beijing.
I know what you mean. I could use a vacation myself.
Hey, Wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime?
Yeah, It sure would.
Yes, I'm the manager here. What can I do for you, Madam?
Did you have the room checked before we move in?
Which room are you in?
1808. The toilet doesn't work properly, The water doesn't run in the shower.
I'm awfully sorry to hear that. I'll turn to it right away.
Isn't it just great! I just knew I'd win!
You did? How? Did you wear red underwear again this year?
Not only that!
Tell me! Tell me! What's your secret?!.
Ok, Ok. I'll whisper it to you, But you have to promise not to tell anyone!
What?! You did that?? !!!.
I'm very sorry I can't.
Why not?
I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business.
Not bad. Thank you for your help. I am always busy with this job, I feel a bit tired.
I had the same feeling when I first came to work here. But after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you'll get used to this busy job.
I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. And you have strong working ability and professional skill, It seems that you know all, That's really wonderful!
You know the phrase, The survival the fittest. We have no choices.
That's right, I have to work hard.
Sorry, I'm engaged for the foxtrot. Will the next Walls be all right?
Certainly.
No, Please feel free.
Thanks a lot.
Do you work in Shanghai?
Yes I do. How about you?
No, I'm a tourist. This place is amazing! It's much bigger than I imagined, And much more exciting! There's so much to see here.
You can say that again! It's much more modern than people imagine. Where are you from?
Um, Well let's see... I'm from Kansas originally. A much quieter and more peaceful place than here, That's for sure!
Uh huh...
Wow! So many people in the United States get divorced!
Is it the same in Korea?
I don't think so. In Korea some marriages break up, But most couples stay together.
Do people get married young?
Not really. Very few people get married beforethe age of 20.
Hmm. Do women usually work after they get married?
No, A lot of women stay home and take care of their families. But some work.
The beauty under the tree?
Of course. No girl is more charming.
She is a young man!
Oh, Over there in Pacific Pavilion.
Is that the large, White building?
Yeah, That's it.
Thanks.
I'm going to graduate this summer.
Where are you going to work then, In Australia or back in China?
I'm planning to return to China after graduation.
Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.
Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment.
Yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country.
Oh, Yes. I love playing badminton, Table tennis and computer games. And playing the games has become my favorite.
I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers. And they don't care about their own health at all. How about you?
I'm no better than them. They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time, But I think it's stimulating.
You won't play online games full of violence, Will you?
Once in a while.
It's no good. And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time. You might as well do something healthy and meaningful.
I hope I can practice self-control again.
It's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders. I play the part of the detective. He has to catch the killer, But there's very little evidence. It's a psychological th.
Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director.
I have had disagreement with every director. I'Ve worked with. We'Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't no.
Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you?
Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think.
Did you do you own stunts in the movie?
I wanted to, But my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, But I'll leave that to the experts in future.
Thank you very much for doing this interview.
My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet?
Yes. I have. I liked it very much. Like you, I was very impressed with Rachel's performance in the movie. She's going to be a star.
She's my grandma.
She's looks very healthy. How old is she?
92.
Hold on. We will be successful right away.
I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce. Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts. Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger!Mmm!Mmm! It's almost lunchtime. I would die for a plate of stir fry right now!
Well, You can keep the vegetables, I'll take the meat. The stir fry my wife made was really hearty, With chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion...
What? You call that a stir fry? More meat than vegetables? That's the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry. What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap!
I said it's a lovely day. Why don't we go for a walk?
Well, I feel a little tired.
Come on! A little labor, Much health.
Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter.
Don't take too long. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather.
I won't be long. No more than ten minutes. Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park?
I Believe I will. Look for me near the lake.
Don't worry about it, I'll call my friend and have him take care of it. I can't believe he was stalking you all these years. What a nut job!
I know! Well... He said I'm not pregnant. I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing. I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose...
Don't apologize! From the moment I met you, Not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again, I'm... I'm just scared, Veronica. The closer I get to you, The worse it gets. The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it! We were made for each other, Veronica. You are my everything, My soul mate. What can I do?
Just hold me... I'll always be here for you, No matter what. And together, We can tackle whatever life throws at us. I believe in us, Steven.
I'm so happy to hear that! I knew we belong together. I love you so much.
As long as it doesn't take too long.
My boyfriend says I work too much. That I spend more time with you than with him.
Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend?
He said not to bother coming back. And I said, Fine, I won't.
So what's the problem?
It's ok. It seems we have a lot in common.
Oh, Really. That is great news. What does he look like?
He is tall and slim, Fair-haired.
Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?
He is a nice guy and very considerate. I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor.
Oh, It's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?
He didn't say, But he said he would call me.
Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!
Oh, Steve. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call?
Come on, Mary, You're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry.
Thank you, Steve. You're always so encouraging.
That's what friends are for.
It was a nightmare.
What's up?
Actually, The business trip itself was very successful. We arrived on time, We had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year.
Sounds quite fruitful, Why do you call it still a nightmare then?
Well, The air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge. I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam. When I finally got home, I was totally exhausted. But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout.
This is really a sad story. Did they trace back your luggage?
I am still waiting for their call.
Take it easy, All sufferings have their reward.
Yes, TheSARS epidemic is not under effective control yet. So I'd better not risk it.
Maybe it's a good things. If you don't have to go to Hong Kong, You can take a break and take things easy for a while.
You are right. Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise. Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit.
That's a good idea. Let's see if we can get more people in this plan. There isn't much business these days anyway, So I think many people will be interested.
I really like the straight legs.
But they aren't very fashionable. What about these?
I don't like the way they sag down. I feel like I have plumber butt in them.
That's the style! You just wear boxers.
What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug? What then?
You're so old fashioned! Nobody is going to pull down your pants!
If you ask me, It's a walking invitation!
Oh!! My car isn't working. I'm waiting for a tow-truck.
Do you have a ride home?
Yes, My wife is coming to get me.
That's good. Do you live near here?
No, We live in the suburbs. What about you?
I live downtown, With my parents.
Do you have a car?
I don't need a car. I walk to work.
You're lucky!
Yes. To our first anniversary and many more to come. Cheers!
I'll drink to that. Thanks for making this a night worth remembering.
Well, It's a special day. They say if you survive the first year, The rest is smooth sailing.
That's good to know. Oh, Listen! The band's playing our song.
I requested it. What do you say? Do you have your dancing shoes on?
Always.
I want to have a picnic with my friends, Mum.
How about a party at home? That way we can get together and celebrate it.
Ok, Mum. I'll invite my friends home.
No. Thanks. I'm full.
I'd love to.
Let's say about 6:00?
That's OK with me.
Oh, Uh... Thanks. Henry, Do you have a light?
Sorry, Here.
Thanks. Lovely day. Pity I'm on duty.
I'll stand in with you if you like. I'Ve got nothing else to do.
Oh, No. I couldn't possibly.
Hi Jack, I'm working on these documents. The manager wants them for half an hour.
Well, Rose.
Is there something any need?
Are your free this weekend?
Yes, I have nothing to do.
Great, Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend?
I beg your pardon?
I'd like to call on you this weekend. I just want to a drop in for a chat.
Really? Well, Ok, You're welcome.
Is 5 PM. Saturday a good time for you?
Hmm, How about seven? I can treat you to dinner.
Sure, That would be great. I'll bring the wine.
Ok. Then I'll be expecting you.
I'll be there on time.
You have 16 balls on the table, 7 solid colored, 7 striped colored, A black 8 ball, And the white ball.
And?
You hit the white ball with your cue. The white ball hits the colored balls. And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets.
How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one?
At the beginning, It does not matter, But once someone gets one ball in, It is set.
Can I get the black ball in?
The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets.
Let's go and try now!
I'd enjoy that.
I'll pick you up around 8: 00.
Ok. I'll see you then.
Me, Too, I can't stop scratching. They are everywhere! Sneaky little jerks.
Do you have any bug spray?
No, I forgot to buy some.
Then we'll have to put up with it.
We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, They'll get drunk and fall asleep.
That's without a doubt, The best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it!
Run! They are thirsty for more!
I've tried, But I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program.
Then stay away. No one is keeping you from doing that.
Don't be so irritable. I just don't understand the program, That's all.
All right, I will explain it to you later on. Now scram.
Ok. I will wait until you have had your fun, If that's what you want.
That's exactly what I want, Thank you.
Ha! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush.
Fair enough. Give it to me straight. Did she bully you into this?
No, Seriously... I really want this.
I tell ya, When I got the invite, It really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.
I know. But things have changed. I guess I've settled down.
I guess so.
It seems quite normal to me. It is pretty much what I want to do.
But what about settling down to start a family? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more?
It is different now. The world is becoming colorful. Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry. We all want to wait for the right moment.
What time is the right moment?
Let the universe find us instead of forcing love. We prefer natural love. The most important thing is to be happy. Love will find us later. That is what we say.
Yes, Of course. It was nice to see you.
It was nice to see you, Too. And please give my regards to Mrs. Robbins.
I'm afraid so.
Winning is a piece of cake to me.
You are bragging again.
Well, The state will benefit a lot, I suppose.
But what do most people think about it?
Ah, It's hard to say.
Of course. Is the dinner still on?
Yes, I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place.
We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice.
That's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark.
It can't be that bad.
I wish it wasn't, But there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here.
Really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, Because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime.
Do me a favor, And take a taxi. It'd make me feel a lot better.
Ok, We will. How do you get around in the evenings?
When I first moved in, I walked everywhere. But within a week, I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station! Now, I always take public transportation.
Has anything else happened to you?
Nothing else has happened to me, But I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close.
Well, We'll be careful. Thanks for letting me know.
Why doesn't he ask her?
He is too scared to ask her.
He's a chicken guy.
Yeah. Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian. She's almost driving Li Na crazy.
If I were Li Na, I would ask her if she had done that.
She is as meek as a lamb. She never goes against anyone or anything. She's as good as gold, You know?
Haven't you heard that he is in prison?
What? Beg your pardon.
John is in prison now. He was copped outstealing.
I just cann't believe my ears!
I need to use the Internet.
You have your library card, Right?
Yes, I do.
There is a wait right now to use the computers.
That's fine.
Would you please write your name on this list?
Then what?
I will call you when a computer is free.
How do I log on to the computer?
Use the number on the back of your library card.
Thanks. I'll be sitting over there.
Thank you. But does it really look all right?
Certainly. It matches your suit perfectly.
Then does it go well with my sweater?
Yes. You look very smart today.
Thank you very much.
If you ask me, I don't think it's guilty.
What do you mean by saying so?
I mean it's not his fault.
Oh, Yeah?
Yes. Don't you think he should be pitied rather than accused?
Thanks! These are beautiful. You shouldn't have!
Of course I should have! You certainly deserve them! You put up with all of us.
I forgot what I put up with. In that case, I do deserve these flowers.
What is it? Maybe I can help.
I never know when to shake hands and when not to. Can you tell me something about it?
Do you come from a country where they shake hands?
Oh yes. Men, Women, And children shake hands all the time.
It's very simple. Men shake hands, Women and children don't.
But some women do shake hands. And now a lot of children have such good manners, They shake hands too.
Well, A good rule to follow is, For men you hold out your hand, For women and children, You wait and see what they do.
That sounds easy enough.
Sure. Once you get the hang of it, It's a piece of cake! It's nothing to worry about.
Don't worry about it. I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well.
Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it. We did try to phone you, But you and Jane must have gone out.
Yes, Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us.
Oh, Yes, I know the one. How was the food?
The food was excellent, But Jane ordered a birthday cake, Which they forgot about. So as you can see, You were not the only one.
Oh, No.
Yes, Jane was quite upset about it. The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert, But still...
I would think this was the least they could do.
In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while.
Great. I have also been thinking of getting one. Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret? My birthday is not that far away.
I can try, But knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately.
Let's go in to wait for them.
After you.
I usually go in my free time on the weekends. How about you?
The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends. I like to go to the movies during the week.
That's true. And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well.
I will be hanged if I lying.
All right. But what was the trouble?
My car run out of petrol.
He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked.
Time to order. Balista, Today I want a skinny triple latte.
When did you start worrying about your weight?
I'm not. I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today. Why? Do you think I'm fat?
No, Jess, Chill out!
We can't break into the line. Don't be so impatient. We'll be at the front of the line soon.
Two tickets, Please. How much are they?
Oh no, Ari. I didn't mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight. Let's go Dutch. I'll pay my own way. I insist.
I'm looking forward to this film. I read a good review of it in this morning's newspaper.
Me, Too. It will be great to see something light and funny for a change. I'm tired of heavy drama.
Are these seats okay?
They're fine, But I can't watch a movie without popcorn.
I buy a computer magazine every month. It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments.
Why don't you find the information on the internet instead?
Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for. Besides, I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes.
Do you have an online edition of that magazine?
Yes, They do. But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription.
Do you have a subscription?
Yes, I do. The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month. Do you every buy magazines?
I only buy them if they look particularly interesting. I don't buy any regularly.
It sure is. I'm glad it didn't rain. My name's Mike Gates, By the way.
Oh, Hi! I'm Barbara Johnson. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry. What's your name again?
Barbara. But please, Just call me Barb.
So Barb... What do you do?
I'm studying medicine.
Really? Where?
At Harvard. What about you?
I'm an engineer at IBM.
Oh, Are you? That sounds interesting.
Yeah. I like it. Hey, It looks like the food is ready.
Good. I'm starving.
What are you so excited about?
I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art!
What's the big deal? It's just a picture of some woman.
I've seen it so many times in books, But I never imagined I'd get to see it in person.
There are tons of other paintings that I think are better.
Maybe so, But do you have any idea how much this one is worth?
No, How much is it worth?
About 80 million dollars.
Whoa.
Part-timer? Is that a new buzzword?
Oh, It's pretty popular among my classmates these days. So are you?
Sure, I have a part-time job as a bartender.
Cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar!
Yeah, But I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, The manager would be pretty upset.
That's true. I'm wondering did you learn anything from the job?
Of course. There's always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world.
You mean you got working experience, Right?
Not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.
It must be very demanding.
Sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, It's easy to figure out.
Really? It sounds interesting.
Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I'll show you around.
Great. I'm looking forward to it.
Yes, It looks interesting.
You're right. I love it very much.
It must be old.
At least more than 100 years old.
Let's enter it!
I can't open the door.
It must be locked.
Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.
She can't answer you.
She must be deaf.
It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?
Frightened? You must be joking.
Yes. I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards.
Which is easier to learn?
Both, But the rules of playing cards vary in different places.
I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you go swimming, Too?
Sure. I think it's a fantastic place to go.
I couldn't agree more. That's an ideal place for a vacation.
It sure is.
I can't wait to go there myself.
I don't think the exam will be very hard.
You should change your attitude, Or you will not pass the course.
Maybe you're right. I have been too lazy lately.
I did, But he gives me a runaround.
If I were you, I would put the whole matter on the table.
But he was trying to beat about the bush. And my talk with him was fruitless.
It's exactly twelve minutes past seven.
When will the lecture begin?
It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp.
I would if I were you.
You said it. I always count on him when I need his help.
Last year he helped me out of trouble, Too.
What is asixties party?
You come dressed in anything from thesixties.
That sounds like fun. But where can I get clothes that old?
Check out your mom's closet. I'll bet she still has something.
Good idea. Can I bring some music from that period too?
That will be great! Do you have LPs or Cds?
Don't tell me you have a record player!
Oh, Come on. You know it's a long process, You have to be patient.
I know it, But I don't know when I can make it better.
A, Whatever you do, The most important is perseverance. So you have to hang on there, The longer, The better. Then some day, You will find you've already made a lot of progress.
Yeah, You are right. I must stop complaining and stick to it every day.
Yeah! Where there is a will, There is a way.
My first grandchild.
And my first nephew. He looks a lot like you, Mum. He does.
Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, He's got Richard's eyes though.
Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.
Well, Children usually resemble their parents.
It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.
You often like comparing children with their parents.
You're right.
How do you like this waltz?
It's very nice.
May I ask you for a dance?
Certainly.
You are doing the waltz wonderfully well.
Thanks. I'm glad you say so. Oh, The music has stopped.
Oh, We never speak Spanish in class! Miss. Parker speaks to us only in English.
I suppose she's right. Does she speak English very slowly?
Not always. Sometimes we don't understand her. Then she has to repeat what she said.
It must be interesting to study English.
Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good.
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult?
Sometimes it's difficult. Some words look different from the way one pronounces them.
What is it? What happened?
I think someone is stalking me.
No, It can't be. Really? Who?
I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, But staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything. Finally, He left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.
Did he leave when you left?
Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.
What did you do?
He followed me all the way home!
That's about five blocks. And around corners too. So he was definitely following you.
Yes, He was. I'm not imagining it. Finally, Just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him. He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious. What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police?
Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least. He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it. But if anything happens again, Then maybe you should call.
Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!
Of course you can call the police if you want. That's not what I mean. I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything.
I suppose. What can they do? I don't even know who he is.
Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much. Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out. If you see him a third time, And if he follows you again, Then I think we should go to the police. But for now, Just try not to worry.
Alright. And I won't go to that cafe for awhile.
I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it. To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It's better to get to know it. What about you?
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays.
Oh, My God! John, I didn't know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, Like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.
Come on, HanMaimed, Don't make a fuss. A lot of Americans, Including many scientists, Believe in religion.
But I'm really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, Are they?
Yes, They are compatible. Actually, The U.S. Is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.
I've heard about it a little bit before, But I don't understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist?
That's a little complicated. You'll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U.S. History later on. Religion was and is a part of American people's life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, Which is a highly academic institution, Is in a sense the product of religion.
Really?
Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.
Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.
How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?
That's because in the 16th and 17th century, There was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.
So, You mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?
Yes, That's why Puritans moved to the New World, Where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, It was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.
Why did they want to found a college?
Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.
Oh, I see.
Actually Harvard was first named 'New College', Without a formal name.
When did it begin to be called Harvard University?
In 1639, It was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.
Therefore, It's not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, There would note Harvard.
Wow, I didn't know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history.
Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U.S.
I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.
Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U.S. History and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.
That's right. I have a lot to learn from you.
You can ask me any question at any time.
Sorry, I really can't do that. There's little time left for us.
I can't accept your excuse. It's five o'clock.
But I have an appointment with Ann.
Ok, Sounds good. But I think it's your trick.
I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you?
I don't often go for walks, But I either play sports outside-you know, Tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book.
What do you do in winter?
Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.
I think most people do. I like wearing nice, Colorful clothes in summer-you know, A nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter.
Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze!
Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year?
Thanks to global warming, It could be hotter than ever!
I think you'll lay it to rest with the time flying.
I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don't want to forget.
But I think time can change everything.
Pardon?
What university would you enter?
University? Why? You asked me last year.
Oh, I forget. Sorry.
I went to Harvard University.
Did you? And what course did you take there?
God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?
I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.
I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?
Terrific! B. A., Again and again-B. A.
Fun for you! Do you get to do anything you want?
Yep. And I should start planning now.
Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions?
Just about. There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone.
How Ay days will the reunion be?
Usually it's at least five days and four nights.
This is going to be a major production for you!
Nice to meet you, Lvan. My name is Alike. I'm from Japan.
To me English is a difficult language.
A second language is always difficult.
True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.
A crazy language? Why do you say that?
One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.
No wonder you say English is a crazy language.
I liked it. I thought it was great.
Yes, I liked it, Too. Did you like the acting?
Yes. I thought it was excellent. Didn't you?
Not really. I thought it was disappointing.
It's a nice cinema, Isn't it?
Do you think so? I don't like it very much. I found it rather uncomfortable.
Yeah, My head hurts, That's all. I'Ve been in physics class all day. It's killer!
I liked physics. It's all math, Really, Arcs, Curves, Velocity, Cool stuff.
Yeah, Yeah, But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.
A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.
It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.
Turtles? Whatever... Look, All that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, That's what the math says.
Math, Sheath. What's the evidence?
There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, Thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, The Big Bang... DuH!
Anyway, It's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that?
Dude, Don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, Didn't you?
There is nothing good at the moment. Let's do something different. Would you like to go to a concert?
Yes, I'd love to. Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven. It's on the Festival Hall. Shall we go there?
Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?
No, I'm not hungry.
Well, Let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, But it's fun.
I partly agree with you. Buying stocks is not difficult, But making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult. Even professionals don't find it easy, So be careful. Anyway, People like us need help with investing. Why not do some online research? There are data, Reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest. In addition, You need to visit an established website that offers stock charts.
Wow, You sound very professional.
I just watched the investment TV program last weekend. It has become a very hot topic these days. Actually I am not even a beginner.
That's out of the question.
Aha. I've read of my roommate. I made a move today.
Really? What was the matter?
You knew Brain Locker?
Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like?
Well, He's thin and tall. He has brown hair, A holt nose, Green eyes and wearing glasses.
Mm. I've seen him a couple of times, I think.
I'm from Guangzhou.
Where in China is Guangzhou?
It's in the South of China.
In that case, I won't keep you any longer. Drop in anytime.
Ok, Goodbye.
See you later.
Mine was ok, Except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.
That's both fortunate and unfortunate. It's the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, A Pole, A Scottish, Two French, An American, A Brazilian,
That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, Except me. There are a few South Koreans, Several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, And o.
Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.
I guess so, But I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, Especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.
Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.
I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.
Well, There is that, Yes.
Yeah, I can really go for some Chinese food right now.
That's a great idea. Let's go to a Chinese restaurant.
I know one. Let's go.
Morning, Mike.
I'm sorry that I was absent yesterday.
I'Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave. How do you feel today?
I feel much better now.
Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday?
I'Ve already got it. Thanks.
I will explain it in detail in the next class. Could you preview it?
I will.
Of course, I like.
What's your favorite flower?
Forsythia. It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival.
Spring is a lively season.
Yes. How about you?
I admire plum blossoms very much. It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter.
You have a perfect taste!
It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow. I admire the bravery of plum blossoms.
But it used to be ignored by many people.
The bright people will remember it forever.
Well, It's snowing. Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing.
It stops snowing, But there's a bit wind.
And the streets are covered with ice. Do you know what the temperature is today?
I missed today's weather for cast in the radio.
It seems 10 degree below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather, But do hate when it get slippery.
The ice is soon be thick for skating. I'm so fine to want a sport.
That's fine. Let's go skating together tomorrow.
I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, Like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, Don't you?
Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.
I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.
Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.
Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.
Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.
I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power.
You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.
That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, But dance might make you livelier and happier.
That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.
I hope that they have a good menu. Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish.
That's right. You don't drink coffee, Do you?
No, So it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop.
What kind of things would you like to see on the menu?
Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least.
That shouldn't be too difficult. Since this is a small neighborhood, Maybe they will take this suggestion.
Let's try it!
Really? I thought his wife couldn't have a baby.
Actually they're expecting the baby to come on my birthday.
Oh, What a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own.
In fact, They're both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, Since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.
Oh, Right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It's hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?
It's still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.
Oh! You mean she doesn't have to work now? It's hard for young parents not to overreact, Isn't it?
Do you have to pay to join?
Yes, Membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars.
Wow, That much? Don't they have any public courses?
Very few, Unfortunately.
How was your game today?
Extremely good. I shot a 78, Including 5 birdies!
Congratulations! What's your normal handicap?
Ten. How did your game go?
My drives were terrible today. I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps.
Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again.
I agree.
The singing group used to be very popular.
I can't believe they would play so good.
Thanks. I'd love to. What time is the show?
It's at 8: 00.
That sounds great. So, Do you want to have dinner at 6:00?
Uh, I'd like to, But I have to work late.
Oh, That's OK. Let's just meet at the theater before the show, Around 7:30.
That sounds fine.
No, It's the Japanese team.
Japanese teams always play a dark horse.
Well, Their team work is well worth learning.
Of course, But we aren't going out, We're just friends.
Okay, That's good.
Do you want me to put in a good word for you?
I know only too well what that's like.
What do you mean?
I was very sad when I was laid off last year.
Hi, Jenny. It's David here.
Hey, What's new?
Not much. My girlfriend just dumped me.
Sorry to hear that. What happened?
Well, She told me things just weren't working out and we weren't right together. But I thought things were just great. Why did she say this? It's completely out of the blue.
Hey, That's not the girl with pink hair, Is it? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday.
What? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy. Oh, No, I feel like such a loser.
Hey, She is not worth it. Forget her.
But she lied to me.
Hey, She is not worth it. Anyway, There are plenty more fish in the sea. Listen, Let's go for a drink in the town. How about that?
Ok, Then.
But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face.
What face?
The one where you look like your dog just died. You have to get over her and the sooner the better.
Yeah, I know. You are right.
A lot. I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life, But so what, It's worth it. Come on, Get in. Let's take a drive.
Okay then, Let's go fast! Whoa! This thing can really accelerate fast.
Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly. It can stop quickly.
Hey, Just watch out for cops or you're gonna end up in the slammer. You know you tend to go fast?
Yes, I know it. I went through my last set of tires fast. I even had three flat tires in two weeks.
Now watch... Some guys probably run a light and hit your car.
Cut out, Would you?
It's just around the corner.
Yeah, I'm very worried about his health.
He looks tired all the time.
He's working too hard.
I am Mormon, So I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
What's the difference between this and other Churches?
Mormons believe that, After the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10, Their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men. In 1830, A prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church.
Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt?
That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, But not all.
Do you believe that Mormons have all of it?
Yes.
Why do you really go to church?
We gather together to encourage each other, Because we have common beliefs. We come together and call it church.
That's okay. Better late than never.
Hello! I was exhausted some studying, So I decided to read the newspaper to relax. Unfortunately, The news is so depressing. There has been another murder in the city center. I'm shocked that the police haven't caught the killer yet.
People are starting to get frightened by it. Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder.
You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer. I'm scared stiff about going into the city center at night.
There must have been some good news in the newspaper. I can't believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited.
Well, There was one good piece of news. You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease?
Yes. Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states.
Well, They'Ve got the money and she's going tomorrow for treatment.
I'm so happy for the family! They must be very relieved and excited about that.
I'm sure they are. Oh, And a local man won the lottery. I'm so jealous! I wish it were me! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I'm amazed that I haven't even won a small prize yet. It's so unfair!
Don't be moody! I hope you're not tired, Because we'Ve been invited to a party this evening. I know how excited you get about parties.
Sounds good. When and where shall we meet?
Let me see. How about 6:30 at the gate of the club?
Fine, See you then.
There are hundreds and hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions.
Can you give us an example?
I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.
What about the expression goodbye? Is that an idiom?
That is just a natural, Grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.
This is interesting, Ms. Parker.
Because Myra was cheating on exams, And she spoke back rudely.
I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher. I know she was angry, But that's still no excuse for rudeness.
Do you need a spot here or off campus?
I want a space on campus.
There's a parking structure for students.
Where can I find it?
Go to the western side of the campus, And you'll find it there.
Is it full?
When I went up there, It wasn't full at all.
When was that?
Sometime this morning.
Would it be full now?
I am really not sure.
Do you mean the 'I love you' virus that attacks computers through e-mail?
Yes. It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world. People say it will break out again om Valentines 'Day this year.
This is terrible. Why do hackers play such a dirty trick?
Hackers are smart, And they want people to know about it.
So they create viruses to tell people they are smart? That's really sick.
Why do you say that?
I don't know what he wants to do. Does he want help me or just scold me?
Think a little. I think he means well at the bottom of his heart.
I'm going to the hospital.
What's the matter?
Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident.
That's too bad. How are things now?
His life is hanging by a thread, And he is under an emergency treatment.
Sorry, I can't. I am busy.
What are you doing?
I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month.
What kind of volunteer work?
I help out at the children's hospital. I help plan activities.
Oh, Yeah?
Yes, It's exciting. This month we are doing crossword puzzles.
Oh, Yes. Laura's the oldest. She's a computer programmer.
Oh, Very interesting. And what about Rita? She was such a bright child — always reading.
She's a librarian at the public library.
Really? And Chris? She was a very pretty little girl.
Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris. She's married to a French photographer.
Oh, How interesting. And what about Larry and Rocky?
Larry drives a truck. He drives all over the country. We hardly ever seen him.
Really? Where does he live now?
Colorado.
And does Rocky drive a truck, Too?
Oh, No. Rocky is a pilot.
Really? Where does he fly? Does he fly to other countries?
Yes. Mostly to England and France.
Merry Christmas, Lee!
Linda, Thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner. I really enjoyed it.
Thank you for coming. I'm glad you liked it.
She's at home.
I know that they are auspicious fish. It's quite popular nowadays.
For God's sake! It's too bloody. How can people be so cruel?
Not at all. I think the tattoos are so cool and chic.
You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people.
Honey, It's not so serious. It's just an animal.
Just an animal? But it has life too. If you want a tattoo, Get one. It's your choice because you want it. But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one?
Ok, I understand, But what else could we do?
It's Ellie and her friends.
Who's Ellie?
She's my little niece. It's her birthday. They're singing "Happy Birthday"..
Oh, I see. How old is she?
She's ten.
I suppose they're playing games.
Oh, Yes. Ellie was playing games all day yesterday. By the way, Alice, When's your birthday?
Today.
Today?
Yes.
Well, Imagine that! How old are you?
Eighteen. Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight. Do you want to come?
Very much. What time?
About 6:00.
I'll be at your house at about 5:30. Happy birthday.
Yes, I hope we meet again.
Sure, I'll give you a call.
Okay.
And what did the program say?
It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier.
I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea.
And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress.
And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, And he lifts weights every day.
Yeah, I went over the figures this morning. We're finally started making money again!
We've never sold this much before, Our growth this year has been phenomenal. We have captured 8 % of the market, Up from last year by 120 %. Our strategy is working!
Not only our annual sales brake a record, But our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well. After a two-year slump, We finally back in the black.
The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president. He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation. Products are selling like hotcakes.
I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution, And partly because of our new marketing strategy. Because of the new advertising campaign, We have become the top sellers in the field.
Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts. I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good.
Let's hope it is!
It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm.
Such a thing exists?
Fortunately, Yes. You're blushing!
Am I? Um... My face gets red when I walk too fast.
You're embarrassed, Aren't you? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy. The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her...
Yes, I received the scholarship 3 times on end.
Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC )?
Yes, I joined the CPC when I was a freshman.
Let's go for a joy ride.
Well, Of course I can't miss it. Which team are you for?
Manchester United. What about you?
Me too. Do you think they are going to get the championship this time?
I have confidence in them.
And it's a long one. I have Monday off. It's Memorial Day or something like that.
Yep. It's the kickoff of the barbecue season. We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow.
Sounds good. What do we need to bring?
We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers, And I'm making potato salad.
I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan.
What's up?
I want to say goodbye. I'm leaving for America tomorrow.
America? Did you get admit to MIT?
Yes.
Congratulations! Susan. I'm so happy for you.
Thank you.
Really going to miss you.
Me too. I'll write to you once I get settled. But I have so much to do. You might have to wait a while. But I really will write to you. I love to write letters. I think it's more meaning than the emails even than the phone call.
Ok. Take care. Have a nice journey.
Thank you.
Look after yourself. Bye.
Bye.
And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves.
But you're not to blame for them keeping him there.
Yeah, What was all that stuff about running tests about anyway?
I'm not sure, But we can find out. I bought some crosswords to keep him busy.
Great, Then let's go visit him. I want to give him some flowers, Too, To say sorry.
Yes, I did. Did you?
Yes, Wasn't it funny?
Oh yes, I loved it. Wasn't the scene with the judge great?
Ha, Yes, Brilliant!
Oh, Would you please turn off the fire? My hands are sticky with the dough.
Sure.
Thanks.
Yes, But why does she have such a long face?
I don't have the foggiest idea.
I thought she'd be happy.
Yeah, Especially since she got a promotion recently.
I don't know. Maybe it's some kind of personal problem.
You've got to be joking! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants, And if she saw Myra cheating, She certainly had the right to say so.
I agree she had the right to say something, But I feel she should have done it privately.
You're right. If I were the teacher, I wouldn't have done that.
Am I late for the party? Looks everyone is already here. Hope I didn't miss something interesting.
No, You are just on time. We haven't really started yet.
Great, Here are some flowers for you. I hope you like them. I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment.
Thank you, They're beautiful. You can hang your coat over there. Try this new couch, It is so comfortable. You will love it. Want something to drink, Tea, Coffee, Juice or Cola?
Don't bother. I will help myself.
Make yourself at home.
It is such a nice place.
Well, I don't mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments. Look, They are making photos now of my designed kitchen.
John, I am just not in the mood for this.
You look so upset. What's going on?
I lost the table tennis game yesterday.
Oh, What a pity!
I just don't want to play table tennis any more.
Is it that bad? It's nothing more than a game.
My opponent bowled me with the very first ball. I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis.
Oh, Come on! Failure is the mother of success. Don't lose heart. I'm sure you'll succeed.
Perhaps you are right. But I still need some time to recover from the failure.
I understand.
It's very nice. I haven't heard live music in a while. This is fun.
Well, Then, May I invite you for the next dance?
Of course. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer...
Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.
You're dancing so well.
You dance beautifully too.
When did you learn to dance?
In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?
It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz.
How about tango?
Oh, I like it. It's such a beautiful dance, But I can't do it well. What about you?
Tango is my favorite. Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot. ( the music has stopped )..
Thank you for the dance.
My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.
Ok.
Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, My country is more agricultural and has much less industry.
We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, But cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced.
The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.
I think you're right. There needs to be an international response to this problem?
What a shame!
I fell down and hurt my arm.
That's too bad.
Then my son drove into a tree.
I'm sorry to hear that.
The dog bit the delivery boy.
What a pity!
And a storm blew our roof away.
Ho, No!
My first grandchild.
And my first nephew. He looks a lot like you, Mum. He does.
Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, He's got Richard's eyes though.
Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.
Well, Children usually resemble their parents.
It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.
You often like comparing children with their parents.
You're right.
I go to bed at ten and get up at six.
That's helpful for your health.
Sure.
When I was young, My parents took me to the one in California. I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld?
The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland, So you must have been to Disneyland.
That's right. Why do you ask?
Well, I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon.
When are getting married?
Some time next year. We haven't set the date yet.
Congratulations! I had no idea.
Thank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time?
Do you like amusement parks?
For the most part, Yes. Some of the rides are bit too scary for me, Though.
If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can, You'll have a good time.
Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark?
Even those. It'll be very romantic, I think. You'll have loads of fun.
Thanks for the advice. I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight.
I'm sure he'll love the idea. Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it!
Yes, I can, But not very well.
Can you understand your Spanish teacher?
More or less. How well do you understand Mr. Wang, Your Chinese teacher?
About 40 percent, If he speaks slowly. When he speaks fast, I can only catch a word here and there. But Mr. Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher. With his help, My Chinese is getting better and better e.
Much better than it did yesterday.
Did you pass?
I not only passed my test, But I aced it! I'm so happy!
You should be. You worked really hard last night preparing for it.
Thanks for helping me with it. If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best, I wouldn't have ever been able to pass.
You don't have to thank me. It's just a part of my job as your counsellor.
Did you always do well at school?
No, In fact, I was terrible at taking exams.
Really?
Sure, But my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot. When are your final exams?
I'll get my finals in two months.
When do you plan on studying for those exams?
Most students just cram the night forehead.
Do you think that's a good idea?
No, I think I should study a little bit at a time, Starting a few weeks before the exam.
That sounds like a good idea. What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying?
I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant.
It sounds like you've learned something useful this year!
Oh, You don't ask much, Do you?
I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition.
I'll tell you what. Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones.
That sounds fair. That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us.
Not as fun though. A live band is way more exciting!
Our class doesn't have enough money. We already checked into it.
Let me know with your next dance. I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity.
Sure, Which beach are we going to?
I wanted to go to Malibu beach.
I like Santa Monica.
The water there looks so dirty.
I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica.
I like the pier too, Because it's beautiful at night.
Is Malibu beach nice?
It's a lot nicer, And I really like it better.
So you want to go to Malibu?
If that's okay with you.
Sure, Let's go to Malibu.
I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action, But I doubt it'll happen before it's too late.
We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere. There's lots of clean, Modern technology, But companies in developed countries say it's expensive. Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection.
Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term, Rather than the long term. It's the same with the destruction of the rainforests. Countries and companies just want the wood. They're not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests. We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life.
In other parts of the world, Especially in Africa, There is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow enough food.
It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains. Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people.
Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment.
I think I'd like to do that. I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies.
I just opened my own restaurant. I'm also head chef.
You're kidding! You've always hated cooking!
Well, I used to hate cooking, But now I love it.
When did you change your mind?
After I tried French food. Before that, I used to cook really boring things for my family.
I still can't believe it! So, Did you go to cooking school or something?
Yeah. I went to California to study.
Really? How long did you stay there?
I was there between 88 and 90.
And what did you do after that?
Then I came back here. I worked for about three years to get some experience.
A house warming party?
Yes, Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn.
Congratulations! That's wonderful. I bet both of you are quite happy.
Well, We have always dreamed of owning our own home, But real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive.
I understand. That's why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town, Far from the city.
That's a good idea if you can find employment nearby.
I agree. That's why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine, Or Wisconsin.
I am trying to find this book.
What's the problem?
It doesn't seem like this library has it.
Have you checked the computer?
I have already.
What did it say?
It says the book is on the shelf, But I didn't find it there.
I can always borrow the book from another library.
You can do that?
I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in.
That's fantastic. Thank you.
I would like to rent a car. What kind of car do you have?
We have Volkswagen, Pinto, Plymouth andDatsun.
What is the rate?
Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen, Pinto andDatsun, And twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth.
How about mileage and gas?
There is no charge for mileage. And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included.
Ok. I'll try a Pinto. I want to rent a car for one week.
All right, Sir. May I have your driver's license?
Here you are.
Sure, I'd love to.
There is nothing good at the moment. Let's do something different. Would you like to go to a concert?
Yes, I'd love to. Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven. It's on the Festival Hall.
Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?
No, I'm not hungry.
Well, Let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, But it's fun.
Yes, That's true.
How long is the holiday?
It depends. But usually it's about 15 days.
Do you eat any special food for the festival?
Yes,Dumpling is a must. There is also other food. For example, People eat chicken for good luck.
That's interesting. I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful, Isn't it?
Yes, It's really wonderful!
Oh, Great! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing.
I'm sure you'll have a good time.
Yeah. Especially when you have something urgent to do.
But a taxi costs too much.
That's true.
Do you have any other symptoms?
I've also got a terrible stomach-ache. Is my face still swollen?
Just a little. Has your toothache gone now?
Yes, For the most part. It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments, Anyway.
How about your tongue? Does it still hurt?
No, The burn ointment seemed to take effect right away. I think it's already healed.
How did you get that burn again?
I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago.
You haven't had much luck lately, Have you?
No, But I'm sure I'll get better soon.
When's the last time you took your tablets?
I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch.
I think it's time you took another does of each. What would you like to drink with them?
Just some water, Please. Do you have any ointment for my nose? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much.
Sure, I'll just go and get it now. What would you like to eat? Some soup?
That sounds good.
Soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick. I hope it makes you feel better, Too.
Why don't you find someone who is in the know.
I'm just thinking about that, But the trouble is, I don't know who is well in the know.
Did you ask his former secretary, Lora? She knows a lot about him.
Thanks for reminding me. She's the right person to help me.
We heard you weren't feeling well, So we came to check on you.
I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden, There she was.
Who, Femi? Yeah, Yi-jun saw her inside.
All these memories of prom night came back to me. I had to be alone. You remember that night?
I remember someone spiked my punch. You sat with me in the girl's bathroom...
Oh, Nothing special. I'm just a bit tired.
With the job?
With everything, With everybody, With all this!
A good suggestion for you. You need a holiday.
It wasn't always like this, You know.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean. We always do the same thing. There's no variety in our lives.
You need a holiday. That's what's the matter.
Certainly, Perhaps.
Yes, It sure is. I had to run here from work! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break.
Well please, Why don't you go ahead of me in line? I'm in no hurry.
Oh, That's so nice of you! Thank you very much.
My pleasure Miss. Actually, Could you recommend what to eat here? I've never been here before.
Sure. Well, The avocado sandwich is delicious, And it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also, The milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town!
Well, Thanks for the suggestions.
Oh, Don't mention it.
It's December eighteenth.
In seven days it will be Christmas Day.
Yes, I know that.
So, Can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present?
Sure, A promise is a promise.
Nothing.
Why do you look unhappy?
I'm rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off.
Oh, Cheer up. He'll understand you.
Yeah, How do you like him?
He's handsome.
Can you give me a touch of his character?
He's outgoing and honest, But sometimes he's a bit conservative.
Don't bother. Those are a dime a dozen where we are going.
No... Mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd. So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day...
It will be. And today is, Too. I just talked to the airlines...
They're going to give us back the seats?
No, They're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in...
Hawaii? My dream honeymoon destination?
You got it! We'll fly there directly from Texas.
Oh, Jack! That's wonderful!
What do you mean?
People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child.
That is called a nuclear family.
I don't like such a family.
What kind of family are you like?
I like a family composed of many people. It includes grandparents, Parents, Aunts and uncles, And children.
It's a traditional family. It may be too large to live well.
We can live well, I think.
We had a difference of opinion.
Is she going to be okay?
She'll be fine.
You bet!
Really? That's a straws in the wind.
I think so. Maybe he's fallen for her.
Yeah. They suit each other. A perfect match between a man and a girl.
Right.
I don't think Joe has done such a thing. Don't believe things in haste.
Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true.
Good morning, Mr. Smith.
I would like to compliment you on your diligence.
Well, Thank you, Mr. Smith. But I was just doing my job.
Yes. And we're proud of you, Loans.
It's nice of you to say so.
I'Ve been to most of the countries in Europe, Several countries in asia-china, Japan, Korea, And Thailand-and to the united states and Canada.
I thought you had been to Australia too.
No, But I'm planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon. I'Ve heard that they are beautiful countries. Which is the most beautiful country you'Ve been to?
I think I ‘d say norway. It has many picturesque fjords, Waterfalls, And mountains.
Isn't it really cold there?
Well, The north of Norway is almost always cold, But further south it can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, So there's snow almost everywhere in winter.
I'Ve been to other Scandinavian countries, But not to Norway. Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there.
No thanks. I have had enough.
Actually you haven't have much.
To tell you the truth, I am on the diet.
That sounds ridiculous. Why?
Well, I am gaining weight these days, And I have to watch my calories.
Thanks for inviting me. Here is the gift for you. Happy birthday, Francis! Many more happy and healthy years for you!
Thank you, Shall I open it now?
Yes, Please do.
Wow, A remote car model and my favorite brand. I really like it. That is so nice of you.
Yeah, I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car. It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself.
Typical you, Always wanting to keep the best things for yourself. The more I appreciate the gift now.
No. Does the newspaper say what has caused that?
Yes. It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics.
I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market.
Right. The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents.
I think they must have horrible lives. All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do. They must get sick of it.
I bet they love it really. Sure, They complain about it, But that just gets them more publicity, Doesn't it?
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves. They only want it for their films.
No way! They want publicity for themselves, So that they get invited to make more films, Go to lots of cocktail parties, And even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party.
Show biz stars have plenty of expenses. That's why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, Seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and at-shirt, But they can't because their managers force them to wear clothes they don't like.
I don't understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They're overpaid, Over-ambitious, And over-adored.
I think you should give them some credit. They're very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves.
Come on! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves。.
Yeah, It's been ages! So how have you been?
Couldn't be better. And you?
Just as usual, You know.
Cut what out I'm not doing anything.
The tapping of your pen on your desk. It's driving me crazy.
Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup!
I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, How can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?
You'Ve got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?
Look, We have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, It's probably not a good idea to keep it up I'm willing to forgive and forget and if you are.
Fine. Let's call a truce. I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down.
Yeah, I'll try to do the same. So, I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night?
Autumn is the best season in Beijing, You know.
Yes, I can see. The summer heat is over, And the winter cold is still far away.
What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year?
Autumn is also very nice in Washington.
Is it very cold in winter there?
No, It isn't. But sometimes it snows a lot in winter.
Does it rain a lot in summer there?
Oh yes! Sometimes it rains very heavily. How about here in Beijing?
There's a lot of rain in summer, But it seldom rains in autumn.
I feel it's rather dry here.
That's true. Many people from the south don't like the weather here.
Are you from the south?
No, I'm from the north. I was born in Beijing, Actually.
I see. So this is your hometown?
Yeah. It is incredible! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi?
Yes, It is. How do you know that?
Well, Qi is famous all over the world, Isn't he? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting.
Cool! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer, Free sketch or claborate-style painting?
I prefer free sketch, Especially the landscape paintings. I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings.
That's true. Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature, Which is an important part of China's traditional culture.
I love this art exhibition!
So do I. Let's go to other areas to see what they have got, Shall we?
Ok.
It has stopped snowing, But it's even colder.
Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves.
And the streets are covered with snow.
Do you know what the temperature is today?
I missed today's weather forecast over the TV.
It feels like ten degrees below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery.
The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I am so fond of winter sports.
That's great. Let's go skating together tomorrow.
You're welcome. Did you have a good time on this vacation?
Very well. If I leave I'll miss you.
Me too. Please write to me as soon as you get Boston.
I'm sure and I remembered your phone number. I'll call you.
Ok, They begin to register.
It's time I left.
Have a nice journey! Do give my regards to your parents.
Eight to twelve in the morning, Two to six in the afternoon.
Much better than mine.
What are your hours?
Mine aren't fixed. Sometimes I do the day shift, Sometimes the night shift.
For What?
Well, I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday.
Well, That sounds like it would be OK. Just be careful.
I went to Yale University.
Did you? And what did you study?
I have a B. A. In Economics.
Would you mind telling me how old you are?
I'm twenty-seven.
And could you tell me what other jobs you have had?
Yes, I have worked in a bank for the last years.
And what was your salary at the bank?
I got $ 500 a week.
I'm all right, Thanks. Just a little tired.
Late night?
Yeah, I got home around two.
Fantastic! I enjoy clubbing, Especially those clubs with live bands. The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad, Full of smoke, And the music is too loud, So conversations are not really possible. Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette.
How did that happen?
A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it. If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face.
Sounds cool! But that is not what a lady should do. People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk.
I'm a doctor.
Really? Do you like it?
Yes, I do. It's very interesting. What's your job?
I'm a bus driver.
Oh, Do you enjoy it?
No, I don't really like it. It's boring.
That would be a good shot. Can you take my picture here, Dear? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well.
All right. Would you please stand closer to the flower bed? Good. Smile. Say "cheese". Ok, Got you. That's terrific.
Thanks. Could you take one more from this angle?
No problem.
Now let's have one together.
Do you know how to set the timer?
Let me see... Set the timer first and push the button, Oh, Come here.
Ok, Let's have a try.
Cheese...
Did it come out?
Yes, But it's blurred and a little dark.
Never mind. Let's go to the falls and try again.
Ok, Let's go.
Yes, I did.
It was a good game, Wasn't it?
Oh, I didn't watch the football match. I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film.
What a pity. It was quite exciting. Both teams played very well.
How did it finish?
It finished in a draw. What was the film like?
It was quite good. But. I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first.
Did your wife enjoy it?
No, She didn't. After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book.
It's the new neighbor. I hate her guts.
I've never seen you so worked up. What did she do to you?
She made another white crack about my clothes.
Are you sure she was trying to put you down?
Of course, I am sure.
You shall go easy on her. She is new here.
Just how am I supposed to do that?
You shall just take it in surprise.
I've tried, But she keeps pushing my buttons.
Try to pull it together, Vernassa. I am sure things will turn note, Ok?
I am not. She is no picnic.
Well. If you think I can help, Let me know.
Thanks, Serena.
Do you already know how to play an instrument?
Uh... Yeah! I'Ve told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums. Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.
Aside from yourself, Who are the other members of the band?
We have a guy who plays guitar, And another who plays bass. Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, Right?
Yes, I'm a singer.
Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house.
Great! Wait here? You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, Microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice?
Oh, Thanks a lot.
What time are you leaving?
1 thirty P.M. But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P.M.
What airline and what flight?
Pan American Airlines. Flight 282.
I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P.M.
Ok. See you tomorrow.
Oh, I see. You'Ve already decided, Have you? Now, You listen to me, You're only 19.
I didn't say I'd already decided, Dad. I said it was for me to decide. There is a difference.
Oh. So you think you can just do whatever you want, Do you?
I didn't say that either. I was hoping we could discuss the matter together. I want your advice but I don't want you to tell me what to do. I'Ve got to make decisions for myself, Dad.
I'd like to book a table tonight.
Yes, Sir. For how many people, Please?
Eight.
What time?
Eight o'clock tonight, Would you please set us in a private room?
So sorry, We're fully booked in that room. Would you like to make reservation some other time?
Maybe not, Thank you all the same then.
Yeah, I'm going to be making phone calls all day. What a blast.
I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast. I appreciate it.
Save it, Vince. After I put my first million in the bank, I'll say you're welcome.
Fair enough. Keep up the good work.
Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute.
Here is a good place. Let's get out.
Wow. We don't get to see this in the city!
Mother Nature is quite an artist.
Look behind us at the mountains! They're reflecting pink!
Amazing. The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere!
Where is our camera? Let's see if we can catch this on film!
Sure. Where would you suggest?
How about going to the suburbs?
Sounds good.
Sorry, I thought you knew.
But you should have told me you were in love with her.
Didn't I?
You know you didn't.
Well, I'm telling you now.
Yes, But you might have told me before.
I didn't think you'd be interested.
You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?
Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.
Oh, You men! You're all the same.
Hi, Jim.
Where is that cool guy, Dick? I haven't seen him for two weeks.
He's been sick since he came back from Italy.
Bummer, I'm sorry to hear that, Is he better now?
Yes, Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP.
He's a little sick under the weather.
Really! What's the matter with him?
He has the flu.
Tell him I was asking about him.
I will.
No, It's no use.
You never know unless you try.
I know. She won't change my grade.
The end of all the hard work for my master's. What a nice feeling to get my degree!
Do you want to attend the convocation?
Certainly. After years of hard work, I wouldn't miss it. By the way, Where can I find cap and gown?
Do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them?
Oh, I think they're provided by the school for that special day.
No. Those you have to provide for yourself.
What do most of the students do?
Well, Most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service, But some of the education majors have had them made, Because they will be faculty members, And they'll need them f.
Then, I might as well have them made.
Mary, Don't move. Stand right there. It's a good shot. The background is very pretty.
Hold it a second. I want to fix my hairpin.
It doesn't matter. Say'cheese '..
Here's Lisa. May I take a picture with her?
Certainly. Ok, Got you.
No, Not at all. Go ahead.
What do you do in order to improve your English?
I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things. Most importantly, I practice every chance I get.
It's a good idea to have a radio, Isn't it?
Sure. It's like understanding on the telephone — — you can't see the speaker! It's great for improving listening comprehension.
It takes a long time to learn a language, Doesn't it?
It certainly does. But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress.
Good morning, Tom. How are you?
I'm fine, Thanks, How about yourself?
Things couldn't be better. Where are you going now?
I am heading for the library. I've got a research project to do. How about you?
I'm going to the English class. It'll start in five minutes, I've got to run.
See you later, Alligator.
After a while, Crocodile.
It is in mine too. The biggest issue is water. The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important.
What methods do you use to conserve water?
Water is rationed. We can only use a certain amount each month. It means that we cannot use some modern household items, Like washing machines. They use too much water.
I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.
Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, My country is more agricultural and has much less industry.
We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, But cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced.
The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.
I think you're right. There needs to be an international response to this problem.
I see. I have run as fast as I can.
Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page, But I think I mastered the tricky section.
Great! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first. Good, Good. This week, Work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note. Now let's take a look at this.
Charles? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here?
It might work. I'll have to hear it. Show me what you'Ve done.
It was horrible! I played play it much better at home!
It's just nerves. Just play the right hand for now. One two three four five six, Ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, Good. Don't forget the accidentals! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b.
Is that better?
Yes, Much better. Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal. What was that?
Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.
That's ok, Keep going, You're moving ahead by leaps and bounds. Watch your dynamics! Keep your elbows lifted. Remember to stroke the keys, Don't pound. That's better! Remember that as a pianist or any.
It's 5:30 by my watch.
Is your watch right?
Yes. There's only a few seconds in a whole month.
Are you angry, Lisa?
Angry? Why would I be?
Please don't tell my mom.
Come on. Dating is a part of young people's social life. Besides, You're sixteen already.
I'm glad that you see it that way.
Do you want to borrow my coat? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you.
Thank you so much, Lisa!
I heard through the grapevine that your getting married.
Yes, Next March.
Congratulations, I hope everything works out.
I wouldn't say so.
What do you mean?
Well, I thought he was, But he ends up to be a con man.
Yes, Everything is fine.
What took so long? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago!
Didn't they announce that our flight was delayed?
I didn't hear anything about a delay. I thought everything was running on time. What happened?
We boarded the plane on time, But then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem.
Then what? Your plane was three hours late!
We finally took off, But about 30 minutes later, The captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight.
Turbulence is pretty normal, Isn't it?
Yes, But this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life! Everyone started getting sick. The flight attendants had to stay in their seats. The captain decided to land early.
So where did you land?
We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again.
That sounds like a nightmare!
It wasn't too bad. At lease I'm alive.
Have you had anything to eat?
I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant. How about you?
I had a few coffees while I was waiting. Let's get out of here!
What's that?
I fell on the way to school, And your bike got scratched. I'm really sorry.
Don't worry about it. It's not new, It already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt?
No, Thank you.
That's the most important thing.
It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid.
Forget about it.
When you lent me the bike, It looked brand new, Almost anyway.
Maybe, But really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.
I appreciate that, Thank you.
Today is December 23, 2002.
Oh, The day after tomorrow is Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you!
Oh, Penny, I'm Leonard, Glad to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Too. I thought I should come and say hello to you. I haven't known anybody.
It is hard to get used to a new place, Isn't it?
Yes. Would you like to come here later to have a coffee? Bring all your family.
We'd like to. Can you tell me when we go?
About 4.
Ok. Do you want us to bring something?
No, Just come here.
Ok, See you later.
Bye.
Oh, How dreadful! I'm ever so sorry.
Luckily that was nothing serious.
Thank God!
That's a great idea. It's the best season for tourists in Florida. You can also get a good sun-tan there.
But if the sunshine is too strong, It might damage the eyes and the skin.
You can put on your shades. And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato. Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off. You may even wind up with skin cancer.
I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good.
You said it.
What does it say?
A lot of things. There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless. You really should read it.
Thank you. But I don't think I'll bother.
Why not? What this article says makes good sense to me. If you read it, I'm sure you'll agree with me.
I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old. But perhaps you can keep the article for a while, I may read it later.
I'm so honored that you thought to ask me.
I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before.
You're going to do great. And you're going to look great.
Thanks. Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion.
I still like the olive one best. There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you.
The question is, Can he have it done before Friday?
These guys are professional. I think they can have it done tomorrow. Let's ask.
Not particularly. I like fat girls.
And I like a girl with good skin, Do you?
I can't say I do. What I like a girl with good manners.
Well, Yes. But surely you like a girl with a nice figure.
Yes. But I like a girl with a nice personality.
But you like a girl to be rich, Surely?
Not particularly. I like a girl to be good.
We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets. I got one last year and I had good luck all year!
Master Li? Who's that?
He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master! Quick! Get in line!
I will! I could use some good luck!
Yes, I do. The look of a picture is very important.
I think sound is even more important! Guns, Bombs,Sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting!
You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose.
In my book, All a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up.
Enough! If we don't finish the game, There won't be time for any movies tonight!
It's Thursday, I think.
Tomorrow is Friday. It's going to be the weekend.
We're busy on weekdays, But we'll have a good rest at the weekend.
We'll meet again in a few days.
Try to keep cool. It's not an easy take.
I know. I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Then you will be in line for a doom.
It's Friday.
Yes, I'm new.
Is this your first year in college?
I transferred from another school.
Where did you transfer from?
I was at PCC before.
Why did you transfer?
I was going to go here first, But my grades weren't good enough.
Did you like it at PCC?
PCC is an incredible school.
Well, I wish you luck here.
I'm sure I'll like it here.
What's the trouble?
The department manager is all over her. He says he loves her.
What about your friend? Did she fall for him?
Of course not! She thinks he's an apple-head. She doesn't like an apple-headed man, You know.
Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach, Do you?
Sure, What do you need to do there?
There's problem with my bank statement. There's a mistake on it. I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM.
I have to exchange some money.
That's right. You're going away next week.
I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account. There was a problem last week.
I have to pay my credit bill too. If I don't pay it soon, The credit card company will charge me interest.
Their interest rates are usually quite high. It's a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest.
Would you like to live in the country? I'm not sure I'd like it.
I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage. The problem is that, For me, Each advantage has its own disadvantage.
What do you mean?
Well, I hate the noise in the city, But I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don't go together.
I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, But I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities.
People can't have it both ways. If you live in the country, It is often less convenient. If you live in a city, It is noisy, But there's more to do.
I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They're so much better to look at than concrete, Rows of parked cars and tall buildings.
I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, You get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.
The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There's so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.
Just remember that in that village there's nothing to do. There's not even a pub or restaurant. There's just one small shop with a poor selection of goods.
You're right. I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends. I would hate living in the country!
Nothing much. What are you up to?
I was just concerned about Sam. He hasn't been himself lately.
He took the civil service exam and failed.
That sucks. He must feel depressed.
Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days.
Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him.
That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else.
Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done.
Sounds good.
Are you sure? He is quite young, Isn't he?
He is not young as he looks. I think he's almost sixty.
Really? He looks so young.
Thank you.
How's your married life?
We're happy together now. We both think that we're a well-matched couple.
That's very good. It's said that marriage is the Ab of love. But the words may not be right.
The situation differs in person.
Take it easy. I have to cut my losses.
I know, But I don't have a choice, My boss has complete control over our work schedules. I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week.
Well, I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work...
No, Not exactly, I'm working for minimum wage. And they don't give extra pay for overtime. Overtime is our own time.
What?! Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights! If you are putting in so many hours, They should give you some kind of compensation.
They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers, But frankly, It's not much of an incentive. They give us a bonus of ten dollars.
That's just wrong! Why don't you just quit?
I would, But I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job. I don't have very many job marketable skills, There aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for.
It sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now!
I felt as if I had been in a different world.
And I was overwhelmed by this scene, Too.
Let me check. Hold on, Please... Yes, That's fine. Smoking or nonsmoking area?
Nonsmoking, Please.
All right. May I have your name?
My surname is Gao.
How do you spell it, Sir?
Does the class start again, Mam?
Yes, But to the health, This break has long enough.
Oh, Breaktime flies.
Come on, Baby. It's time now.
Mam, Another minute, Could I?
Hurry up, Little boy.
Oh, Iris, It's about the job with the PR company.
It's a great opportunity. You should be happy with the offer.
But my mother won't allow me to accept any part-time job. I'm afraid she will say no again.
Why? It's unfair. You can learn a lot from it.
She says a part-time job is cursed blessing. It takes so much time and energy that I won't be able to focus on my studys.
That may be true. But I'm sure you're able to find a balance between them. Why not try it?
I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake. But I'm a senior now, I don't want to miss the chance this time.
I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind.
I'll try, But what if she insists?
Just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding. And more importantly, You can manage both your study and the job.
Do you think it will work?
Sure. Every cloud has its silver lining. Just try.
Ok, I'll do that. Thank you, Iris.
Sure. Good luck, Maria!
I went to play tennis in the public park.
How often do you play tennis?
Twice a week. How about you?
I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.
What is very difficult to gather team player together.
I usually play with my school-mates.
Do you like watching football matches?
Yes. I went toTinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday.
I've got a date.
Why don't you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy, Being outside working during the day?
What do you suggest? I can't afford to quit my job until I get a new one.
Maybe you have two choices. You could attend school during the day, Or you could get a position that provides training.
And what did the program say?
It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier.
I think that many physicians now agree with that idea.
And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress.
And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, And he lifts weights every day.
I was playing a joke on you.
That's too much.
Dear, Forgive me. I won't do that again.
I'm going to Hainan.
Oh really? It'll be nice and warm there. Have you been there before?
Yes, Actually it's my second visit. I was there last October.
I see. What's it like there?
Well, The life style is much more relaxed than here in the city. And the seafood is tastier!
Well, Have a great time!
All right,Sis!
Come on, It's cool outside.
I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us.
Hey, Daniel, What's your favorite weather? Snowy or sunny?
Me? Er, I like hot weather, Just like today.
What? Are you crazy?
I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out.
Ew, Danny, Gross!
By the way, What's your favorite weather?
I love snowy, Because it is very very romantic.
Look, Is that Tom?
Well, That's life.
Yeah, He did. But he only won it by a hair's breadth.
But anyway, He won at last.
Yeah. To win is the most important thing.
It's my geography, Sir. The Map of Africa you set us.
But this should have been handed in last Thursday.
Yes, I know, Sir. I'm sorry.
Well, What's your excuse then?
My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home.
Oh, Yes?
It's true, Sir.
Are you new here? I come to this coffeehouse often. But I didn't see you here before.
Yes. I started this part-time job just three days ago. And my internship will last 1 week. I'm still a student now.
Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here?
Of course not. You know, There are many foreign customers like you here. And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English.
Oh, Are you an English student? Or you just study English for interest's sake?
No, I'm not an English student. But I do like English. I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language. So I try to improve my English.
Very nice. Thank you for your time.
Thank you, Sir. But I'm not allowed to accept any tips.
Ok then. I don't want to put you in trouble.
Well, Would you like something else? The new-made cafe parfait is really good. Want some?
Ok. But I'd like some cookies.
Sure. If you want more coffee, Please go over there. There is self-help coffee maker.
I surely know that. Don't forget that I am a regular customer here.
Oops. Well, Wait for a while. We'll get it done quickly.
It's OK. Thank you.
I don't think so. It changes so quickly this time.
I hope so. We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it.
I think you can go to visit the museum. It's worth seeing. You can go to the square some other time.
Good idea. Thanks a billion.
After you.
Pardon?
What university would you enter?
University? Why? You asked me last year.
Oh, I forget. Sorry.
I went to Harvard University.
Did you? And what course did you take there?
God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?
I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.
I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?
Terrific! B. A., Again and again-B. A.
Did you see his last dive?
Yes, It's perfect!
He's diving for the gold.
Yes. I have been here for three years.
Do you like this campus?
Well. I'm rather disappointed with it.
How come?
It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected.
Oh. It's awful, But it can't be helped.
I'll just have to put up with it.
Don't be too humble. Few young men could be equal to Mark. And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck.
I agree. Both Joe and Mark are men of guts.
Hi.
What are you planning to do today?
I'm not sure yet.
Would you like to have lunch with me?
Yes. When?
Is 11:30 AM OK?
Sorry, I didn't hear you. Can you say that again please?
I said, 11:30 AM.
Oh, I'm busy then. Can we meet a little later?
Ok, How about 12:30 PM?
Ok. Where?
How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant?
Oh, Where is that?
It's on 7th Street.
Ok, I'll meet you there.
Fine, Thanks. How about you?
Thank you, I just tried my best. I am very happy to know you like it.
You must have been prepared for a long time. Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find, Right?
Well, Yes. Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that. They are very supportive. I consulted an economic expert last week. He was very kind to give valuable suggestions.
Now, The effort pays off. You have accomplished something.
Come on, Don't flatter me anymore. I took the job because I love being challenged. But I can't get this turned around without the support from you people.
Can't you stay for a little bit longer, It's only 8.
I wish I could. But I'm afraid I can't. I've got some serious studying to do. I have to go.
Ok. See you on Today.
See you on Moday. Have a great weekend.
You too. Thanks for dropping in.
Yeah. But in my heart of hearts, I find he's not very much to my liking.
Then why not keep away from him?
The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now.
That's stupid.
I'm fine. I've been out of town. I just got back.
Where were you?
I was in New York for a wedding.
I like it a lot. It has a very funny beginning, I think. It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it.
What do you like best about it?
I like the plot. It's so full of twists and turns. I also like the main character. She is so humorous and smart.
What do you think of the ending?
The ending is a bit weak. It's so abrupt, Like those of most other detective stories.
Really? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing.
That's right.
You'll exert all your energy and get out of it.
Yes, It's my new business phone. Do you like it?
It's very impressive. Can you use the Internet on your phone?
Yes, It's got wireless Internet access.
That's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth?
Yes, But I don't really use it often. Have you ever used it?
No, But I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go.
Yes, I guess I should try to use it.
Good morning, John!
I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday. Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday?
I'd be delighted to, John. Saturday did you say?
Yes, If that's all right for you.
I'm pretty sure I'll be all right. In fact, I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you. What time are you planning to start?
Oh, Good. If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock, That would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner.
That sounds fine. I'll be there around seven.
I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition.
It doesn't matter. Forget it.
I don't think I performed well.
Oh! That's much hetter than I did.
Can you tell me how to improve myself?
There's no secret at all. The only thing for you to do is to practice more. You will succeed.
Thank you for your encouragement.
It's a pleasure. Come on. I'm on your side.
What time are you leaving?
I'll leave at 10 o'clock.
Take care and give my best to you parents.
Thank you, I will. Hope to see you again next year.
May, Just let him go.
But he took some newspaper away without paying.
I know.
Why? You make me confused.
He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines, Read the political sections and return them later.
Why does he have such a privilege?
He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him.
I see. Does he live by himself?
Yes, He has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle.
He must be lonely?
I bet. But he is always busy telling the children stories.
How respectable!
I need to get on the Internet.
Do you have your library card with you?
Yes, I have it.
You're going to have to wait for a computer.
That's okay.
Please put your name on this list.
Then what do I need to do?
When there is a computer available, I will call you.
What do I do to log on to the computer?
Just type in the number on the back of your library card.
Okay. Thanks for your help.
Yes, I am. When is the wedding?
Aug 8.
August bride. How nice! By the way, Who is going to be the matron of honor?
Mrs. White.
Oh, Yeah? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding. You know her father passed away several years ago.
Maybe her uncle will.
I think so. The wedding will be held at her church, Right?
Right. Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding.
Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon?
Yes, Jane says they will go to China.
No problem. I can deal with it well.
You will ask for it.
All is best now, Isn't it?
Don't build a fire under me. I know the importance of time.
But you are too slow to follow them.
Don't you see I'm trying my best?
Oh no, I won't. But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting.
You see. I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful.
Oh, Shut up, Will you? It was all your fault. If you'd kept quite this would never have happened.
Oh, So it was my fault, Was it? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
Did you have something on your mind? You look so concerned. Maybe I can help you.
Well, I am under a lot of pressure. My boss is very pushy. He assigned me three projects. Now the deadlines are near, And I still have not finished all of my projects.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to, So that I can relieve my stress.
Sure, When is good time for you?
Can you make it on Tuesday?
What time do you want me there?
Anytime after six will be fine.
All right, It's a date.
What's her figure?
Perfect, And I like her charming eyes too.
What's the color of her eyes?
Dark blue.
I'm not sure, But probably about 75 years. How about in your country?
About 70, I think. This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population. It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world.
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, Because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly.
Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.
Did she? That's great. However, If we have too many children, That will have a bad effect on the enviroment.
How's your son these days?
Oh, He's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays.
He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you think it is a good age to have a child?
I had mine when I was 24. That's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., Or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.
Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, But not just yet.
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country?
Yes, There is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, Have fun, And explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, But they don't often succeed.
Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.
It's almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, Kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, They might go wild.
You're screwed. You can't do anything about that. You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful.
Do you think going to the registration building will help at all?
No. They will tell you the same thing in a worse way.
Did you register yet?
Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss.
What classes do you think are still open?
Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, So there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology.
That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.
I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, So if you go to his office, You can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.
He does that?
I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class.
That makes sense. I think I'll do that. Thanks for all the help.
No problem, Man.
Any time. I'm just glad I could help.
What's the matter? Are you OK?
I don't know where to go for college, And what to major in.
Don't worry. You have plenty of time to decide.
And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition. I want to get the burden off my family.
You always worry too much about everything. Take it easy, Honey. You are good enough. You can go to the ideal college.
Ok, Ok. I'm so sorry. By the way, For you, Is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work?
In a perfect world, I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much, And make lots of money!
Ok, Honey, Stop dreaming. You should face the reality.
That's only a joke. To be honest, I have to improve my English, Because my English is not good enough. I still get confused about some simple grammars. Since you are quite good at it, Do you have any suggestions?
En, First you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class. Second, I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center.
Is the training center helpful?
I think so. Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation.
Why?
Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time.
Yes, They do. Do you have a Christmas tree this year?
Yes, We have a big tree this year. I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday. Do you want to come and see it?
I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother.
When can you come?
I don't know when I can come. I'll let you know later.
Yes, You're right.
Why don't you try to give it up?
I've tried to give up smoking several times, But it's no good. Smoking relaxes me.
Have you ever thought of just cutting down? You could do it gradually.
Yes, Maybe I should have another try.
Awful. It was a complete waste of time.
Why? What was it about?
It was about a married couple. They had to live with the wife's mother, Because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own.
A lot of young people have to do that.
Yes. But the husband had to work overtime three times a week, So he was always tired.
Lt sounds like the story of my life.
Yes, It does, Doesn't it? But this man was always over-tired, And he couldn't sleep. So he used to take two sleeping pill every night.
I take sleeping pills sometimes.
Yes, But not two every night. Anyway, The strain was too much for him. He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital.
It sounds a very depressing film.
Not really. His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter, Because she could speak French and German fluently. After a few months 'work, She had a better job than her husband. So in the end,
I don't know. My wife used to speak French. I must tell her to brush it up.
Sure.
Let's get a soft drink.
Do we have enough time?
It's a fifteen-minute intermission.
The seats are excellent. We're right in the center.
It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great.
I can't agree more.
Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert?
In the United States, Yes. But back in China, I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents.
Do you have large concert halls in your city?
We have two. One is like this one. The other is a little smaller.
That's great. Well, We'd better get back to our seats. It's about to start.
What time will the library be closing?
It closes at six.
Does it always close at six?
No, Not every day.
Will the library be open on Saturday?
Absolutely.
What are your hours on Saturday?
Saturday's hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night.
All right. Thank you.
What else can I help you with?
That's it. Thank you.
That of the old man.
You're absolutely right! That's the very figure I like best.
Some of the scenes moved me into tears.
Pardon?
I won't say who, Because I'm not sure yet. But I'll know soon.
Zina, I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad.
It isn't Elvin.
Dave then? Dave is a spy for WebTracker? You can't be serious.
Loan me that tape recorder you have. And don't say anything to anyone until I come back.
Hi, Lin Tao. I have't seen you for some time.
How's life going, Zhang Lin?
Yes, The same as ever, Thanks. What about you?
Pretty good, Thanks. I'm going to see my uncle.
Good bye then, And keep in touch.
Good bye.
Yeah, He has a good commend of computer skills. But...
But what?
But he is always talking big.
My feelings exactly.
I really enjoy the beach in the summer.
I couldn't agree with you more.
We should come here more often.
You are absolutely right.
I'd like to come back next weekend.
That's exactly the way I feel.
Are you kidding? Don't you know I can't swim?
You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath, Are you?
Hey, Don't shout. Come here! Sit closer. Now, Jim, We'Ve had a lovely day. Don't spoil it now.
What about your beautiful bathing suit? We shopped all day. Don't you want to show it off?
Everybody who walks past me sees it. Besides, It's a good sunbathing suit.
All right. Suit yourself. I am going swimming.
Jim!
Yes?
Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair? I am really tired of lying in thousand.
I've got a better idea. Why don't we hire a boat and go for a ride? What do you think?
Are you serious? That will be wonderful!
I'm sorry, But you were the only one who had access to it.
I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures.
I'm sure they will.
No problem.
What's the tallest building?
You mean the white building near the playground?
Yes.
That is the library. And it has more than 1, 000, 000 books.
What's the building to the south of the library?
You know, Our school is divided into two parts, The junior high school and the senior high school. That is the new classroom building for our senior high school.
Is there a swimming pool in your school?
Yes. There is a large swimming pool, But it is only available in summer.
I do envy you. And I hope I can enter your school one day.
I believe that you can make your dream come true.
I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me, Rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish.
Do you think of television though as a great time-waster?
Un... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see...Mm, It can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching.
Aha, But how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get... Get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things... Best programmes that... That undoubtedly are on television?
Well, I suppose one of the problems is... Will depend on what a person's life style is, And that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television, He will then, You know, Hmm. Be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things.
Do you think though that... That in... In a sense television skilled people's own er... Sort of, Creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television?
Yes, I think that is a danger, And I think that.. In fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their... Their main... Um field of amusement and... Because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be, You know, Particularly interested in talking to them, You Know the television will be the main thing in the room.
Thanks.
I feel the same way.
It must be dreadful to grow old.
Yeah. He has no one to count on.
What's your trouble?
I think I need a thorough check-up.
I got it.
What is the problem?
I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative.
Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?
Yes, I've got that part covered.
When, Exactly do you need to leave?
I don't need to leave until the very end of class.
Fine, But next time try and not have to miss class again.
Thanks, Professor. See you later!
See you later! Drive carefully.
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
It's sounds like fun.
It's very dangerous, You know.
I want to try something exciting.
It's an easy way to get hurt, Let me tell you.
I'll tell you all about it next Monday.
Well, Take care of yourself, And don't say I didn't warn you.
I think he has realized that. But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act.
He might be driven up a wall. You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves.
But when I noticed that he was left in the cold, I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation.
What's he like?
Oh, He's a very serious person.
You must feel very uneasy at his home.
Hi! I'm Nancy. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Too.
Where are you from?
I'm from Shanghai. And you?
I'm from Chicago.
It's fun.
Oh, I am very sorry, Hans. Thank you for waiting for me. You must have been here a long time already.
It's all right.
I was caught in the heavy rain, Or I would have come earlier. I am sorry I kept you waiting.
I was in a comfortable place, So really, It's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long?
Yes. When I came out of the subway, It was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up.
I totally understand.
Good morning, Emma! A lovely day, Isn't it?
Yes, It is. The sun is shining. There is no wind, Only a pleasant breeze.
It is the best season for a picnic right now. Have you decided the place for your picnic?
We have decided to go to the park this Sunday. Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet?
What did the whetherman say?
He's predicting clear skies.
Well, I will think it over.
Professor Donald, Are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester?
Yes, I am applying on it.
I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I'm a junior, But...
Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.
I know, But the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field.
Well, If you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.
Oh, Thanks, Professor Donald. This is really very nice of you.
Isn't that a good thing? Having fewer bosses means having less stress, Don't you think?
Actually, I don't think so. Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace. They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees. If there is no one to keep an eye on us, No one would get any work done. You know what they say, When the cat's away, The mice play.
You're right, We do need leadership. But what we don't need is too many people to lead us. You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians...
Alright... I get your point.
It's interesting, I like being an editor.
Why?
I like talking to writers, I get to meet a lot of interesting people.
I'm happy to hear that, But publishing is more than just talking to writers. It involves a lot of work, Patience and responsibility. Most of the work is boring.
I don't feel bored at all. I'm getting along with my colleagues. I will enjoy working with them. People are great in this industry.
Do you have any complaints?
No, I have no complaints. I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company. Is that true?
Yes, You have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well.
That's perfect. I will definitely do well.
No, I don't think we have.
My name is Dick Brown.
How do you do? Mr. Brown. I am Susan Heywood.
Mr. Smith often talked about you.
Really? I am glad to meet you.
I'm honored to know you.
I don't want to.
Well, Come and talk to me then.
Certainly not.
May I turn on the radio then?
Turn on the radio? What for?
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music.
Listen to some music? And who'll cook dinner? Will you?
Ok, I will. But let's go to a disco after dinner.
To a disco? Oh, No. You know I hate pop.
I am not in the mood.
Why are you feeling depress?
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. It's a real letdown.
I don't think she would do such a thing.
But she did and it made me disappointed.
Oh, Cheer up! A girlfriend is not everything.
But she means a lot to me.
Then forgive her mistake.
Oh, I just can't forget it.
Take it easy, Jim. Your mother didn't mean it! Need any help?
Yes. Can you help me remember how to spell 'beautiful'?.
I can't seem to make a decision.
Where do you want to go?
I honestly have no idea.
You haven't thought about it?
I like it here at PCC.
Why don't you just continue going to PCC?
I like that idea.
It's a great school.
I completely agree.
So, Have you made your decision yet?
I'm staying right where I'm at.
Not really, Do you?
Well, I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something. You know, I just came back from a really tough interview. I was quite nervous during the interview. I really want to have the job. Right now, I am still a little on the edge. I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview.
Take it easy. It is all over now. How was it going, Anyway?
I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, But they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, The manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me.
That's strange. But probably, It is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ”. What about your answers?
Just did my best.
It's ok. It seems we have a lot in common.
Oh, Really. That is great news. What does he look like?
He is tall and slim, Fair-haired.
Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?
He is a nice guy and very considerate. I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor.
Oh, It's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?
He didn't say, But he said he would call me.
Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!
Oh, Steve. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call?
Come on, Mary, You're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry.
Thank you, Steve. You're always so encouraging.
That's what friends are for.
Who do you think that has the motive?
I'm not sure now. In any case, Let's first make some careful investigations.
Ok, Murder will out!
Yeah.
Coffee? I don't honestly like that kind of stuff.
Come on, You can at least try a little, Besides your cigarette.
What's wrong with that? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for.
Not for me, Dick.
You're welcome, Diane. I hope you can visit us again soon.
I'm not in the mood.
Why are you feeling depressed?
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. That's a real let-down.
I don't think she will do such a thing.
But she did and made me disappointed.
Oh, Cheer up. A girlfriend is not everything.
But she means a lot to me.
Then forgive her mistake.
Oh. I just can't forget it.
I graduated from Songhua University.
When did you graduate?
I graduated from it in 2002.
Nice to meet you, Andrew. I am Noirin, Noirin O'Neil.
I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
Noirin, N-O-I-R-I-N, It's an Irish name.
No, Thanks. I've decided to give up smoking.
Really? Why?
Well, It's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more, You should stop doing it.
I see. You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more?
That's right. You should give it up, Too. It's bad for your health.
Stop talking like my mother. That's what she keeps saying.
But it's true. It's a nasty habit. I can't think why I ever started. Anyway, It's obviously got you in its grip!
What do you mean? What are you talking about?
I mean you couldn't give it up!
Who? Me? Could't give up smoking? Nonsense! Of course I could! I know I could!
How do you know?
Because I've already proved it. Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up. I've done it hundreds of times!
Just between you and me, I think he's lazy.
Haven't you ever seen him working late?
No, I haven't.
It's harmful not only for yourself but for others.
What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking?
Stop producing cigarettes.
But that'll affect the national economy.
That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.
How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet?
Maybe it can take effect.
Many thanks for your presence.
I went to a movie with my boyfriend.
Really? How was it?
It was great. The director took a lot of care while framing. They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director. Also I like the actors, Some really great new young actors.
Oh, Yeah? What's it about?
Well, It's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds. But besides a beautiful story, The cinematography is great. There is some really dramatic footage. It's really quite a visual feast. And the soundtrack is moving.
Sounds pretty good. Is it a tragedy?
The ending is a bit of a surprise. I don't want to ruin it for you.
Oh, I like movies with surprise endings, Although, Sometimes they can be frustrating. Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend.
It would be a really good choice. The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together. I'm sure you won't regret it.
Sorry, I can't.
Tomorrow night, Then?
I'd like to. But I'm afraid I can't.
I'm wondering if you like to go to the theatre then.
That's sounds great.
Ok. How about give me a ring, Then?
No. I'd better not.
Why not?
Because I don't think my husband would like it. Thank you for inviting me anyway.
No. I'm serious. I'm going to quit my job.
That's amazing! You got a good pay here, Didn't you?
It's true. But I can't show my abilities.
Come on! Don't be silly!
Your present job is something better. Why do you change?
Well. How do you know?
Over my dead body you are!
Hey, Anna, This is Jason.
Jason, Where have you been hiding lately? You know it's been a long time since your last call. Have you been good?
Yes. How are you, Anna?
I am fine. What have you been doing?
Working. I've been really busy these days. I got a promotion.
That's great, Congratulations!
Thanks. I am feeling pretty good about myself too. You know, Bigger office, A raise and even an assistant.
That's good. So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you.
You are kidding.
How long have you been working there?
A bit over two years. This is a fast-moving company, And seniority isn't the only factor in deciding promotions.
How do you like your new boss?
She is very nice and open-minded.
Much better than the last one, Huh?
Yeah. He was a real slave driver. He probably would have loved it if we were robots.
Forget about him. Come over to my house tonight. Let's get drunk.
Good. Tonight 8 o'clock.
8 it is. See you then.
Bye.
That's a good idea. What's on?
Gone with the Wind.
What's it about?
Sorry, I've no idea.
What do you mean? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free.
But why? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free? Or shoes? I just don't understand why it's always liquor.
Well, It's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it.
You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things?
Yes, Of course. Didn't you know that?
No, I didn't. How high is the tax?
Well, It is different in different countries. But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal.
Why would the government want to tax liquor so much?
Liquor is considered a luxury item. And also, It is considered as something that isn't very healthy. So if people want to buy it, The government thinks it has the right to tax it.
That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too, Isn't it?
Of course. Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily.
Nothing special.
How about going to English corner with me?
Oh, I'd rather not.
Why not?
You know, I am poor at English, Especially spoken English.
That's why you should go there, If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes, You simply will never learn English.
I'm worrying about the children. After all this is the first time they have been out without us.
Don't worry. They are grown-ups.
I know. But I couldn't help.
I don't know. I'll have to ask my host mom.
Come on, Mary. This is America. You make your own decisions here.
But I still have to tell her.
Of course.
Tell you what, Give me your phone number.
It's 555-4321.
Got it. I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday.
My mother is a professor and my father is a manager.
Do they often take you out?
No, Usually they're very busy.
I beg your pardon?
I said I had been to the doctor the day before.
What did he say?
He said I'd got the flu.
Oh dear! What did he tell you to do?
He told me to stay in bed for ten days.
Ten days? Would you please repeat it again?
Yes, Ten days.
Same to you.
It's such a nice change.
I really don't think this weather will last.
Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again.
What's its name?
' Romeo and Juliet '..
What is it about?
It's about their great love.
Sounds interesting.
Of course. Do you want to see it?
Yes, Do you have tickets?
No, I don't.
Let's go to the theater and buy two tickets now, Shall we?
Good idea. Let's goa.
Ok. Let's go.
I just lost my job. My boss just told me.
That's unbelievable. Why did this happen?
I don't understand of myself. It seems they have to save money.
I cant't believe it. You've worked here for years.
He was 20 years old then.
How old is he now?
He's over sixty.
Nice to meet you, I'am Simon. I don't think I'Ve seen you around before.
No, I just started working here at IBM, I am in the sale department.
What do you do there?
I main marketreasearch, And you?
I'Ve beaning worked IBM for years. I am vested personnel file system, He is the after sale survise director. He such a nice boss, I like working for him.
Really? I don't believe I would met him, Is he here now?
Yes, That's him over there - the taller, Handsome one. Would you let me introduce you?
Thanks, That's would be lovely. You 'r right, He is kind and nice looking.
I register this Friday.
What classes do you plan on taking?
I really want to take the communication class, But I don't know if it will be available.
Is that class really that popular?
Yeah. I tried to get in last semester, But it was full by the time I registered.
What other classes are you going to take?
I still need to take English 201, But I really don't like writing.
I took that class already. There is a lot of writing, But it's not that bad.
Oh really? Who was the instructor? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from.
I had Professor Mahoney.
Is he an easy grader?
I'm not sure if he is or not, But I thought he was definitely fair.
Do you mind if I ask you what you got?
Not at all. I got a 3. 8.
Well, What did you get in English 101 last year?
I got a 4. 0 in that class.
Well, I can't compare to you. I got a 3. 1 in English 101. That means if you got a lower grade in English 201, It must be harder.
It's not what it appears. I actually tried harder in the 101 class. If I put as much effort into the 201 class, I would have received the same grade.
Oh. That helps. Thanks.
What is it?
He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death.
Don't you like to know anything about stocks?
I'm not at all keen on this subject.
Oh, Mr Green, My name is Jianshan. You don't know me, But I'm a friend of David Smith.
Oh, Yes.
When I told David I was coming here to live, He give me your number, And suggest that I give your a ring. I was wondering if you could give me some advices.
I'll be please to if I can. What can I do for you?
Well, I'm looking for a place to live. David thought as you are a @ agent. You might know something is suitable.
Yes, I think I can help you. Why not you come around and see me? Do you know my office?
Yes, I've got the address.
Good, Where are you now?
I'm at the post office.
Oh, Well, That's just a few minutes walk to my office, Come around and see me now.
Thank you very much, Mr Green.
Not at all.
Oh shame! I have a class tomorrow.
Well, Then join us some other time.
Yeah. Thanks. And have fun!
Nothing special.
Would you like to have dinner with me at King Hotel at 7pm?
I'd like to. See you then.
Oh, This is over my head. It's too professional.
What's your favorite course, Daniel?
I like science most.
Science? That's a surprise.
Surprise?
I thought you would like PE.
I do like PE, But I am interested in science.
Are you interested in science? I can't believe it.
Through this course, I can learn more about the world around us clearly.
Your parents would be happy if they knew that. Because you are always a naughty boy.
Naughty? I'm naughty? I'm just clever. So I only do the things I am interested in.
Hope so.
Ok, I'Ve been looking for a job for days, And I haven't found one yet. It's so hard finding work these days. Have you had any luck?
Yes, I've got a job, A waiter's job in a restaurant.
Are you well paid?
Well, $ 10 per hour, But I can keep the tips. That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening.
Not bad.
Actually, There's still another opening. If you are interested, You'll surely get it.
That's great! I'll go there right now and speak with the boss.
There's no rush. You can see him tomorrow. I'Ve told him about you. He promised to give you the job.
That was nice of you, Susan. Thanks a lot.
Think nothing of it, Tony. I'm sure you'd do the same for me.
Could you tell me a bit more about the work there? I mean, Those dos and don'ts. I am a green hand, You know.
First of all, You must be punctual. You should be there before 6 p.M. So that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that. Then, Remember you should smile. Smile to your customers all the time. Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day. Anything else? Oh, Yes. Never argue with your boss. Learn to say 'Yes, Sir.'.
Be a yes-man, You mean?
You may put it that way if you like. Don't worry. You'll have no problem.
I hope not.
Yeah, I didn't get the job in the end.
Oh, What a pity!
It's ok, That's life.
I think we would be able to make it. What time shall we come?
About 7 o'clock.
Shall we bring any thing? Some wine?
No, Not really. Just bring yourselves. We would like to your presence.
No, I haven't. I'm so surprised at the news.
Indeed, We got married too soon.
Congratulations. But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time?
Yes. However, I believe that marriage comes by destiny. I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time.
How's your married life?
We're happy together now.
I have to say you're a well-matched couple.
Thank you!
Yeah, I really got a lot of the session. The workshop topic was resolving personal problems. It was led by a professional human resources director. The teacher had a lot of experience, And I think we were all given a really good base to start with.
The workshop was only one afternoon long, Do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours?
It depends on the topic, The teacher, And the way the course is set up. Yesterday, Even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues, The workshop got us all thinking. We learned some very basic, But very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues.
Sounds like you really learned a lot.
I did... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared.
They say he can sum up like winking.
How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me.
Maybe he's gifted in that.
What?
She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars. Com web site by the end of next week.
What!? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month! Is she crazy?
Yes, I think she is just a little bit crazy.
Crazy is too kind. Insane is more like it. Nuts! Wacko! Psycho!
Sure. Thanks.
Say when.
That's alright.
She's gone to a flower shop. Today is her husband's birthday.
That reminds me. My wedding anniversary is tomorrow.
I like baseball the best.
Me too. Did you play when you were a kid?
Yeah. I played until I graduated from high school.
What position did you play?
I think I tried every position, But the last few years, I played third base.
I hate third base. It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast.
It was scary at first, But after awhile, I got used to it. If you have fast reflexes, Then it's not really a problem. What position did you play?
I played outfield. I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces.
I wish I could play again, But there isn't much opportunities around here.
I'm on a softball league. It's not fast pitch, But it's still fun. You wanna join our group?
When do you guys play?
We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays.
Sounds pretty fun. I'll come out and join you next time.
That is just wishful thinking. The cost of higher education has increased in recent years, Faster than the cost of living. So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it.
But it's unfair for Jane.
What have you done?
Going shopping. It tires me too much.
Why don't you go shopping online?
Can I?
Why not? Let me recommend a website.
Ok. What does it sell?
It sells almost everything you can see in the department.
That's great.
Not much, Just heading over to the shooting range. You wanna come?
Seriously? You mean to fire a real weapon? I don't know man.
Yeah, It will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. I also have a revolver that's really fun too! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you.
Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower!
Whoa, Take it easy there Rambo. Don't get carried away. These weapons are not toys, And you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be.
Wow, I didn't know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies!
The reality is different you know, Running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies! So are you ready?
Let's do it!
Really? You are a lucky dog. You know, Many girls dream of dating him.
Yes, I know. He's really on the A-list.
It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today.
Does that actually work for you?
I don't really know for sure yet. I'll tell you after the test on Friday.
I like to use shorthand note taking.
I was told once that the more time you spend writing, The less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff.
Hmm. I never thought about it that way.
One time I tried just listening, No notes, No pictures. I think I really learned more that day.
It will be a rock and roll band probably. He's a very good guitarist.
Can you play a musical instrument? If you can, He might ask you to join the band.
I can play drums, But I haven't played for a while. I'm not sure I'd be good enough to play in a band.
I wish I could play a musical instrument. I love music.
Nowadays, You can be a DJ. You can mix dance music. You don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing.
I love to try it, But the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice.
You know, You could probably get a computer program that would help you. You already have a computer, So you could use that to help you mix some music.
That's a great idea. I'll search for some information on the internet. If it's possible to do, The internet will have some information about it.
What?
The wonderful passing Melaena did.
Too bad I missed it.
You have any idea why?
She broke up with her boyfriend.
I heard her boyfriend is married.
She still loves him. That's why she feels upset. Her love is always hard and confusing...
Then what about you? How are you getting on with your boyfriend?
He sometimes really drives me crazy.
Yes, It's a family tradition dating back to my childhood. We use the same lights and ornaments, But of course we have a new tree each year. The children made some of these decorations. Here, You can hang this on one of those high branches.
Well, Everything seems to be just about ready. Now all we need is snow. Do you exchange the presents in the morning?
Oh, Yes. The kids are too excited to wait. After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast. Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys.
And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock. My brother and his family will be joining us. I look forward to meeting them. Well, It's late, So I'll say good night. I'll see you early tomorrow, So I can share your Christmas morning. Good night!
Five and a half years. We moved here on the first of November.
You have a fantastic view.
Yes. I love living here.
Look! You can see the village way down in the valley.
Yes. It's a lovely view.
Yes, It is. We've been dating for over 7 years. We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th, 2008 is a red-letter day.
Good for you! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time.
Yes, There is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos, Wedding dress, Catering, Transport, Hotel, Etc...
Is everything ready now?
Almost. The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel. As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married, It is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive.
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job.
Yes, We called, But it is booked up. The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet.
It's an excellent hotel. A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, Though very expensive.
That's why we want to have a look at other hotels. We don't want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception.
I guess you're right. I can help you ask other hotels. I am sure there are probably some available.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
You moved to a new place?
Yes, I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats. Right now, It looks like a home. I would like to have a small celebration party. Please do come.
Thank you for inviting me. Sounds lovely! I would like to come. Where is your new apartment?
It is in the DX community, Room 306, No. 2 building. It is very easy to find. Just ask the guard at the entrance.
Who else will come?
I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor, Paul. He is a very good person. You should meet him.
Ok, I will be there around 6. Is that ok for you?
Yes, Great. I am happy you are coming.
I'm planing to go balling tonight. Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie. What about you?
I want to go camping, You know, Just get a way for the weekend. I'm not sure I'll be able to, Though.
Why not?
Well, I have a lot of work. I'll see how to goes.
I'm here on business.
Yes. He is an old man with a great sense of humour. Not only can he play the piano, He also draws pictures very well.
So you can learn a lot from him.
Yeah, He has no children, So he sometimes feels very lonely. I often go to his house to play and talk with him. That makes him feel very happy.
Thank you. Same to you.
Have you got any plans?
I've been invited over to a friend's, And you?
My roommate's having a party.
I know. It's going to be so much fun.
I always get excited the day before.
I used to be like that. But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore.
I only go skiing twice a year, So it's a real treat for me.
That makes sense.
What things make you excited?
Whenever I go to Vegas, I get really excited.
Oh... That makes me excited too!
Looks like anything fun makes you excited.
Yeah, I want my own house very much, So I decide to buy one.
Let meet this right — — do you want to buy the house?
Yeah. This is a big house with a garden. I like it very much.
But it is far from downtown. Living here is very inconvenient.
It is very quiet and peaceful. This is what I want.
I was looking for a book, But I couldn't find it.
Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf?
I already did.
Is it on the shelf?
I didn't see it.
Apparently somebody took that book out of the library.
Will you ever get another copy?
We will definitely be getting another.
Could you please reserve it for me?
That won't be a problem.
Thanks. I really appreciate that.
Next Saturday? I'm sorry. I'Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter.
How about Sunday then?
Yes, Sunday sounds fine. What time?
Does six thirty suit you?
It suits us fine. We'll see you then.
Thanks, Goodbye.
What can I help you with?
I'm not sure how to find my next class.
Do you know what building that it's in?
The C building, I think.
Well, That's not far away.
Could you point me in that direction?
Do you know what the room number is?
It's C261.
My next class is around there.
Can you show it to me?
Sure, Let's go.
What do you think is wrong, The math or the way your answer was scored?
Both.
I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes, Too. Will that work for you?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake.
These look strange.
Yes, I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score. Would that be OK?
Ok, Let's do the calculation.
We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.
I see.
Anytime you have a question, Please feel free to ask!
Get a hold of yourself, Bruce. You'll get over her eventually.
Are you sure? He is quite young, Isn't he?
He is not young as he looks. I think he's almost sixty.
Really? He looks so young.
Sure, When is good time for you?
Can you make it on Tuesday?
What time do you want me there?
Anytime after six will be fine.
All right, It's a date.
Oh, About two years now.
Where do your parents live?
They still live in Shanghai where I was born.
Do you write or call them very much?
Yes, I try to keep in touch with them.
You've got no guts!
My name is Jessica. What's yours?
John.
You speak English very well.
Thank you.
Do you know what time it is?
Sure. It's 5:10 PM.
What did you say?
I said it's 5:10 PM.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You're mistaken about it. As a matter of fact, It's very hard.
I don't think so. There're so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese.
You're quite right. But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes.
Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me.
Yes, I think so. My friend once used it mostly to play chess, But now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet.
There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium. It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services.
That's true. I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net. Customers, In turn, Can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered.
Yeah. It'll be a shoppers heaven. That's the use of net in E-commerce.
What do you mean?
Now, I am responsible for training new staff, But you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods. I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove. But I don't like your way.
It was so fantastic I didn't really want to come home.
Did you happen to meet someone?
How did you know?
You always act like this when you'Ve fallen in love. Who is he? How did you meet?
His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos. He works with my sister who lives there.
Was it love at first sight?
Not really. I wasn't looking for a holiday romance, But my sister told me that she had promised him that she'd set him up on blind date with me. I didn't think I'd have anything to lose, So I went.
And?
Let's just say that by the third date, We both realized that we had fallen in love.
That happened quickly! Are you going to see him again?
Luckily, His company has a position available here, So he's going to see if he can get relocated.
It sounds like he is madly in love with you. Are you ready for such a serious relationship?
Well, I'm not really a spring chicken anymore. We don't know what will happen.
Yes, I'm afraid I am. My husband is a smoker too.
Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker?
No. But my husband smokes 20 or more a day.
When did you begin to smoke?
I had my first cigarette when I was 17.
Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?
Yes. Twice.
I'd like to go into management. I'Ve applied for several jobs already and I'm hopeful that I'll get some job offers. How about you?
After I graduate, I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer. I think I'Ve got a good chance of passing. There's a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London, Provide.
We both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions.
If life were easy, Then we'd achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored.
Unfortunately, It's inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed.
That's why ambition need to be realistic. You can't achieve something that's totally unrealistic.
As long as you plan carefully, Most thing are possible. It's always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong.
I think it's important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in, Not something that other people force you to be interested it.
My father wanted me to become a doctor, But I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field.
I hope my parents don't try to interfere in my choice of career.
Total Fitness, Why?
Well, I'Ve been going to Athletic Express, But I don't like it there.
Really? Why not? I hear it's pretty good.
The people don't really work out there. They just stand around and talk all the time.
Oh, It's one of those places.
Yeah, Is your club different?
Well, They have different rooms. I lift weights by the pool where there aren't so many people.
Do they have a lot of equipment?
Yeah, They have all the machines, A pool, And a steam room and sauna.
Sounds nice. What about classes?
The usual. Aerobics, Kickboxing, Yoga. They just started a Tai Chi class too.
Wow, That sounds great.
Well, I have a guest pass. Why don't you come with me tonight?
Really? Thanks. I'll stop by when I get off work.
Perfect. See you later.
O. K., See you.
Yes, I've just come back from Scotland.
Where did you visit?
I only had time to visit Edinburgh.
How did you like it?
It's fantastic.
Why did you go there?
I went there on business.
And do you have friends there?
Yes, A lot of friends.
You must have enjoyed yourself.
Yes, And I look many pictures.
No, I only know four great beauties of China.
There were some famous ugly women in history.
Yeah? Were they famous because of the ugliness?
Though they were ugly, They had great virtue.
Then who were they?
Mo Mu, Thong Lichen, Meng Gang and Ran Nv. They were well respected.
It seems that the inner beauty is also important.
Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful.
Don't you know they've already broken up?
I'm not surprised. She's a plain Jane.
And he's so handsome.
I just had a quarrel with him.
Would you rather I taught him a lesson for you?
No, Thanks.
True. With the extension of railways and highways, And the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes, Ships and boats have been giving place to trains, Planes and automobiles.
I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo andDalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 %.
The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster, So the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow. I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat.
But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat.
Don't be that negative.
How can you be optimistic? You can see it in their eyes.
I find it there is no meaning in living this world.
Don't be that negative.
Really, Life is so boring.
I booked a table yesterday.
What's your name, Please?
Smith.
A minute, Please.... Yes, This way, Please.
Me too. I like the festival best of all.
Think of the big face down the eve, Hmm.
And special TV programs, Fire crackers and the games to play.
Hey, Do you know any mystery belief serve the festival?
Such as?
You know why fire crackers are set off in festival.
Why? To welcome the new year of course?
And also to frighten away evil spirits.
Really?
And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year.
Oh, That's why my parents never scold me that day. They always try to avoid tears and quarrels.
Oh, That scared me.
The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake.
Oh, Dear! How ruthless!
Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims?
Why not? That's a good idea to help them.
Hey, That coffee shop's lights are still on.
Maybe they have some good pie.
I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun.
There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate.
Mmmm. That sounds like something I had in Mexico once.
Good stuff... Oh, No. The door is locked.
Ohhhhh! And I just got all my juices going!
Fine, Thank you.
And how's everyone in your family?
Very well, Thank you. I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00, Would you care to join us?
I'd love to but I'm afraid I can't. I'Ve already got a lunch engagement.
It was all right. She, Tall and attractive, Has stable job and source of income.
Yes, So I think she is suitable for you.
But, Well... What I want to say is...
Stop acting like this. Say away!
Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher. I can not accept that.
What did she say?
She said she want a man with large house, Luxurious car and healthy parents.
Give her up.
Hey, Isabelle...
Logan! Why on earth are you hiding here? White hat! Come on! Don't tell me you're the guy! It can't be true.
Yes, I am the guy.
What a bummer! You set me up?
Let me explain. I didn't mean to hurt you...
How dare you!
Hang on a second. Hear me out, Just this once, Isabella!
Why did you lie to me in the email?
I didn't lie. You just didn't ask me my real name.
I should have known it was you. No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly. I thought I might have found the one for me.
I'm sorry. It was cruel of me. But I promise it will never happen again? Look, There's a nice restaurant. Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over.
Really, It's so beautiful.
You like it. Well, I'll gather in for you.
You mustn't pick it in this place.
Where it is?
It's a private garden.
Do you really like it?
Yes, It looks perfect.
It wasn't very expensive either.
That's amazing!
Five days a week, Too?
Actually, Five and a half. On Saturday, We have classes only in the morning.
Gosh!
That's too much for us really.
Where are you going now?
I'm going to try to find out where the school is located.
When do you start school?
I'm going to register right now.
That's good.
Well, Flying kites is more fun to me.
I've got no kite. Do you have one?
Let's go and buy one.
I suspect it's unavoidable.
Poor Ann. She did not love her husband at all.
Yeah. She married him at her mother's bidding.
Well, I nearly always get up at dawn. I don't like sleeping in late. The days are longer in summer that in winter, So I get up in summer. I usually do some exercise when I get up.
What do you have for breakfast?
I usually have cereal, But sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast.
That sounds nice. How do you spend your mornings?
I usually do housework in mornings. I go shopping occasionally. I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket. I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center. It takes about.
How do you spend your afternoons?
I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies. I spend winter evening watching tv, But I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time.
What?
I said, I'm Ted, Who are you?
Huh? Oh, My name is Laura.
Do you somewhere often, Laura?
Huh? I can't hear you, The music's too loud.
Let's go outside and talk. So Laura, Do you come here often?
Hold on, My ears are still ringing from the music... What was it you asked me?
I asked if you come here often.
Sometimes, Usually once every few weeks. Do you?
No, This is my first time here.
I usually come with a group of friends. We dance a little, Have a few drinks, And just have a good time.
Yeah, That's why I'm here. My friends dragged me here, Because they think I spend too much time studying.
That's good. It's good to hit the books, But you need to get out once in a while.
I guess so. But the music is too loud. I don't mind getting out and meeting people, But next time I'll do it in a park.
They sure are.
Did you hear about the pilot?
The one that stole a small plane?
Yes, He stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.
Did they catch him?
Yes. After two U.S. Fighter jets followed him for an hour, He landed on a highway.
Did he crash?
No, He just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?.
His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
Poor guy.
The last straw, Huh?
Yes, He's really pushed me too far.
I know what you mean.
That's right. Do you think it'll be cold?
It might be. You'd better take a heavy sweater with you. The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year.
Do you think I'll need a cotton coat?
Not for now, I think, But I believe there'll be rain, So take your raincoat with you.
Yes, I watched United play Chelsea. What a fierce battle! Allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield. Well, It was not like a normal English League match.
No, It wasn't. Rather, It looked like a Bundesliga match, Where physical contact is so frequent. English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes. It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly. As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, They often knew only chasing hard after the ball, But forgot to steal it.
Haha. That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, And offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent. And the ball is often kept flying overhead, Drawing beautiful curves in the sky. Such games are quite pleasing to the eye.
Which team do you back then?
I'm a firm United supporter. I like their playing style. The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs, Like Riggs, Peckham and Gary Neville. They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking.
But the Reds keep a weak midfield. I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield. It is the main source of its strength.
Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?
I am a daytime student.
Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?
I will be driving my car.
Ok, That will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?
I'll pay for it with a check.
Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?
No, Thanks ; I'm fine.
Here you go then. Have a great school year!
I take architecture as my major.
What research are you dealing with now?
I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings.
I'd love to.
Morning, Mike.
I'm sorry that I was absent yesterday.
I've already got your certificate for sick leave. How do you feel today?
I feel much better now.
Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday?
I've already got it. Thanks.
I will explain it in detail in the next class, Could you preview it?
I will.
Well, You can just see the sea. Between the factory chimneys.
Isn't it awful? I can't bear to look at it. I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks.
Well, It can't be helped. We'll just have to put up with it.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Yes. I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted.
Just because he gets on well with everybody?
Partly, And he's also a hard working man.
It's big and exciting but noisy.
What can I see in Beijing?
You can see the Forbidden City.
What's it like?
It's beautiful but crowded.
Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?
I'm thinking about taking his class next semester.
He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?
I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, But I also worry about grades.
Grades are important, But don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, Too?
I really need to learn this stuff.
He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?
Yes, That sounds right for me.
Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?
Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing.
I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your year!
Not bad at all.
Just one moment. I'll check with the cancer ward desk.
The cancer ward!? Oh, My. It's worse than we thought.
Ma'am, I'm sorry. The cancer ward said Mr. Smith passed away two days ago.
That's impossible! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith.
Yes, Ma'am. He died from complications of stomach cancer. I'm very sorry.
I'm really sick!
Not really.
They're awesome! I was browsing through the eBay auction today, And I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha! It's over a hundred years old.
Please don't tell me you bought it.
Why not?
If you did, You probably got ripped off.
Sure. What do you want to know?
Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree?
Well, You have to get 166 credits, Including required courses and optional courses.
Ok. And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree?
It can be completed in four years normally.
I see. Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
You have asked me several times about it. You are driving me up the wall.
I'd like to very much.
All right, Then. There is one at the new concert hall.
Who's playing?
It's the Powell orchestra.
Do you know what they are playing?
They're doing a seventeenth-century program.
And who is directing?
Well, I'm not sure of his name, But I know it's going to be his farewell performance.
I need to be motivated, Vince. Multi - motivated. As in multi-million.
What if I said no?
Ever hear of WebTracker?
You wouldn't! If you leave, You'll make nothing.
I might make nothing even if I stay. For that kind of risk, I want to get rich.
Ok. If you sign the Stars. Com account before WebTracker does, We'll talk next week.
Yes, Please. That is very kind of you.
Shall I make more sandwiches?
No, Thanks. I'Ve had plenty.
Impossible! Well, I'm not giving up yet. It's not over till the fat lady sings!
Ok, Comeback kid. Here's you last question. How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor?
Hmm. Let's see... There was Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poet's Society, The Fisher King... Three, Right?
Nope, Sorry! Actually, Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor!
You're not the only one with a lot to do. We are all in the same boat.
I may have something on that day, But thanks for inviting me.
Well, Drop by if you can.
I will, Do you want me to bring anything?
No, Just bring yourself. I hope to see you there.
Yes, Thank you. I'Ve already been helping myself.
This dish tastes terrific. Would you like to try a little? It is a little hot, But very good.
I like hot food, EspeciallySichuan cuisine.
Would you like another beer?
I'II have another cup of beer insist. I know I don't like to drink alone, Especially there are someone sitting there next to me.
Come on, It's the weekend. Let's taste and enjoy this meal. Cheers!
Bottom's up, And you're right. This meal is incredible. I wish I had known this restaurant before. Thanks for bringing me here. I know I'll be back soon.
More or less. There's just one thing bothering me.
Oh? What's that?
Well, You know I have some students studying for their master's degree. One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy.
What gift?
It's an Egyptian carpet. The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude. Seeing what gift was, I was really uncomfortable. I mean it's too expensive a gift.
You refused the gift? That's terrible.
I know, But I really can't accept such an expensive gift. I explained to him why, But he seemed really upset about it. I think he might have taken it the wrong way.
Perhaps. He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade.
That's what I am worried about. I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored. But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor.
Me too.
I can't stand the loud noise in the city.
Yes, Sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night.
I hope I can stay here longer.
When will your vacation end?
The day after tomorrow.
You will go back tomorrow, Right?
Yes, You are right.
I have no idea. To be honest, I couldn't care less.
Just the two of you?
Yup.
Where did you go?
True, A sea food restaurant.
True? The food is terrible.
I didn't notice. I don't really even know what I ate.
Really?
Almost. I have to get dressed. It's a formal party and I have special party make up!
Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine!
Great! Uh, Remember that there's a gift exchange, Too. We all have to bring a gift.
I've already got mine.
( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve! Time to open presents!
Here! Open mine first.
Wow! It's just what I wanted!
Hey! Why don't I have any presents!
Hi, Bill, This is my new car.
Hey, Great set of wheels.
You like it, Huh?
Who wouldn't? Wow, That's out of this world.
It is special, Isn't it?
Yeah, Too cool. How much did they sold you for?
Lots. Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years.
I can imagine.
Hey, Let's go for a spin. You can try it out.
I'd love to.
Ok, Let's go.
My goodness! It's the afternoon? Doesn't the time fly! Do come in and sit down.
Thank you.
What's the time? My watch has stopped.
It's half past twelve.
When do you have lunch?
From one to two.
What do you normally eat?
We usually go to the cafeteria.
Oh, It's time to have lunch now.
Let's go together.
Not at all.
If I have time, I will come again.
You are welcome at any time.
Thank you for your hospitality. I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay.
You are most welcome.
I'm afraid I have to go now. The plane will take off soon.
Call us as soon as you got home.
I've no idea. I'd like to listen to your suggestion.
It's my pleasure. Actually, It's really hard to say as individual tastes are different. As for myself, I'd like to recommend gin and tonic.
Well, I'll try gin and tonic.
Don't count on it.
Actually, I was watching your auction all along. I saw you drop out at $ 250.
You sneak!
I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315. I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325! I sniped him!
But that's a lot of money! Honey!
Were you here last week?
I was unable to make it.
How come?
I was sick that day, And couldn't make it.
Well, Here are the notes.
Are there any more?
Sorry, Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
No problem.
No, I rarely smoke. I don't drink, Either. I only drink with my family on celebrations or with close friends.
What kind of winter sport do you like best?
My favorite winter sport is skiing. In addition, I am keen on basketball.
What do you like doing in your spare time?
I like doing aerobics in my spare time. It's good for my health.
Do you have any hobbies?
Yes, I have. I collect stamps, Chinese stamps as well as those from other countries.
That is a good idea, I love it. What time do you think is convenient?
Well, What about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting?
Ok, I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch. It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time. I am sure they don't want to miss it.
I hope so. Let me know how many will come. Then I will book the restaurant.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Have you just started college?
No. I transferred here from a different school.
What school?
I transferred here from PCC.
Do you like it here?
I really like it here so far.
Do you like it better here or at PCC?
I like PCC better.
If that's the case, Then why did you leave?
I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree.
I haven't decided yet.
Well, Make up your mind. We need to know.
Ok, Count me in.
Yes, I'm sure I've been here before.
Maybe we're walking in circles.
Yes, There's that bar we passed an hour ago.
That would be great. I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot. Any special reason for the invitation?
To thank you for helping me at work last week. If you would not have been so kind, I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport. You really did me a big favor. Thank you so much.
It was my pleasure. How about this evening? I feel very hungry now.
Fine, I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area, Food there is pretty spicy too. Shall we try that one?
Ok with me. You are the boss. I will meet you downstairs after work.
70 hours? I would be dead if I worked hard like that.
It is really gorgeous out today. I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain.
I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today.
Really? That's unusual for October, Isn't it?
Well, You could never tell about the weather here in New York.
Yes, That's true. Still, It's hard to believe. Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
Maybe you can pick Mary's brains now. She knows a lot about stocks.
Let me have a try.
I'm sorry. Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming. That's out regulation.
Yeah, I see. You are just doing your job. But I wanna know what the advantages it has.
Ok, Lovely boy. Try to be patient. Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up?
As far as I know, People will be weak if they swim too long.
That's right. But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming.
Is it very dangerous? I'm a little scared. Do you offer the lifebuoy for us?
Yes, Besides that, We also provide our customers with goggles, Swimming suit and something like that.
Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen?
Of course, All the workers here are able to swim, And they will come to your aid quickly.
Much better. My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me.
Don't be sad. Everything will be fine.
Thanks a lot. You are so kind.
It's ten thirty.
I am going to the beech. How about coming with me?
Great! I love swimming. Besides, I need a tan for Hill's party...
Don't forget the sun block lotion. You don't want a sunburn, Do you?
No. Thanks for reminding me.
Why do I need to do that?
My character is in question. Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi, I'm a suspect.
Oh, My goodness. Who do I need to talk to?
My employer. Can you come in to the office tomorrow?
Absolutely. I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere.
That would be the real proof. Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane?
Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board.
Neither. The game ended in two all.
But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized.
But the Brazilian is tougher.
I love to dance the fast music.
Then you must be interested in disco.
Yes, It's my favorite.
Oh, It's a disco. Let's dance.
You're a good dancer.
Thank you. Now they are playing a rumba. Would you have a try?
Sorry. I feel like sitting out the next dance.
Ok. Let's get something to drink.
Good idea.
Yeah. I bet you did forget everything. What's the date today, Do you know?
I bet it's May 5th.
Not so bad, But Kevin does have problems with his wife.
What?
His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion.
Poor Kevin, We should do something for him. He is a nice guy and does his job well.
Yeah, I agree with you. But you know, It's just one of those things.
Certainly. You are more welcome to do. What is it?
Tomorrow is my wife's birthday. We both love spicy Chinese dishes. I am wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant where I can find some good spicy dishes.
Well, If spicy local dishes are what you are looking for, In Hua Restaurant is the best place to go. The restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes. You might want to try there.
How far is it from here?
It is near the university. Five minutes 'walk from your flat, I think.
Great. We'll go and have a try. Thank you very much.
You're welcome. May you have a good time. Please give my regards to your wife. I wish her a happy birthday tomorrow.
Thank you. The same to you.
No. Have a seat.
That sounds good but I don't know what's on.
I think there's a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant. Let's go and see that.
Ok, That's a good idea. Where shall we meet?
Well how about meeting at my place?
That sounds good. I'll call you once I arrive.
We'll first go to Mount Tai, Then we'll go toSichuan by air, After that we'll be leaving for Tibet.
How long will the trip take?
At least 20 days.
What are you talking about? Where is your Halloween spirit? Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends?
Of course, I did, But when I was ten! Trick - or-treating is for kids, Plus, I'm sure people will think you're a kidnapper or something, Running around with kids NCP at night.
Whatever, I'm going next door I heard Mrs. Robinson is giving out big bags ofM & Ms!
What were you thinking?
I think I want to try a new style.
What would you like me to do?
I want you to cut my hair shorter.
How short?
I want my hair to be only a few inches long.
Do you really want it that short?
Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now.
If you really want me to, Then I'll do it.
I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want.
Let's do it.
Yes, We are.
When are you getting married?
In the spring.
Oh, Lovely. Where's the wedding going to be?
Well .. we're not sure yet, Probably in St. Albans.
Oh, Yes, Your parents live there, Don't they?
Yes, That's right.
Where are you going to live after you're married?
We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London.
Are you going to give up your job?
Yes, Probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in.
Thank you, Peter.
Oh, Let's come in and enjoy yourself.
Happy birthday, Peter, And many happy returns of the day. Here's a present for you.
Thank you, Li Mei. Come into the dining room. I'm going to cut the cake soon.
What wish do you make?
It's a secret.
I use several services. Of course, I deposit and withdraw money quite often. I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account. I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another. I often travel abroad, You see.
Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around.
I sometimes use traveller's cheques, But sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash.
Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills? I use direct debit.
Yes, I do. It save me a lot of time. I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines.
That's good idea. You don't need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that. I suppose you have a mortgage too.
Yes. My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage. There's a lot of competition between banks nowadays. Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others.
I have a deposit account with my bank. There are some restrictions on withdrawing money, But the interest rate is much higher.
I don't have one. I prefer to buy shares. My bank also provides a share trading service. It's cheap and easy to use.
That's great. But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain.
Well, Going to a cinema, Visiting the galleries, Exhibitions and museums, Finding and meeting old friends, Exercising in the health club or mountain biking. There are so many good choices.
The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun. I just don't know what to do first.
Why not start with the most interesting one?
Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, The harder to make a decision.
Toss a coin to decide then.
Which John? Mr. Turnbow's son?
Yes. I'Ve read news about him in today's paper.
And he's bright and intelligent. I'm sure he can pass the university entrance exam.
I wish he could too.
How's your boy, Jack?
He's a bit tired, You know. It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up.
Poor boys! They work harder at school nowadays, Don't they?
Good luck to them.
Yes, That's right.
What do you suggest I should see in New York?
Well, How about the Museum of Modern Art?
No, I don't like museums. They're boring.
Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building?
Ah! That sounds interesting.
No, Not really. Why do you ask?
Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost.
You saw a ghost? When?
It was many years ago, When I was a little child. It was the middle of the night, And I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen. I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, When...
So that's where you saw the ghost? In your house? What did it look like? Was it hideous?
It was a big, Green thing that looked like a person. It was in the kitchen, And it slowly moved towards the stairs...
So what did you do?
I hid so that it couldn't see me. Slowly it got closer and closer, Until...
Until what? What happened? Did you see it clearly? Did it attack you?
It moved slowly up the stairs, Step by step, And I could hear its approaching footsteps. When it finally got to the top of the stairs, I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas. He had gone to get a late night snack.
Yes, But it's not so appetizing.
Have you thought about another job?
That's what's hanging on my mind recently.
Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia?
Yeah, And meet other drivers of the same car!
Cool!
I know girls love this kind of car. Look, It's got a sunroof! Imagine... A cool, Starry night...
So, You're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks?
No. I borrowed it to go shopping.
Yeah. It is not easy for them to find another job.
University graduates have difficulty finding a job too. There seems to be more and more competition in the job market.
It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one. What do you think? Do you want to quit your job?
No. Not now. I think I'll try to keep this one.
Fine, Thank you, Sir. It's nice to see you again.
Good to see you again, Too. How's you family?
Very well, Thank you, Mr. Parker.
I wonder Why.
Can't you stay a little longer?
I am afraid not.
Say hi to your parents for me. I hope to see them soon.
Thank you. Well, If you ever pass my home, Please drop in.
Yes, I will. Take care, Then.
Yes, Sure. Have a sweet dream!
But I think it's fantastic and charming. Well, You have your opinion and I have mine.
Maybe you're right. But I just still can't understand...
Come on. I don't see any point in arguing about this. Everyone has a right to his own opinion.
Thank you. I have roses, Tulips, Anddaffodils. Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers?
Yes, I do. Those are violets, Aren't they?
Yes, They are. This afternoon, I'm going to prune the hedge.
The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low. Would you like me to cut them off for you?
Thank you! That would be very kind of you. I have a saw in the garden shed.
When the lower branches are removed, You'll be able to sit under the tree.
Tomorrow, I'll cut the grass. Then the garden will look perfect.
Just make sure children don't play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers.
Is she really? I can't believe it!
Yes. Yesterday.
Good gracious. That's incredible!
She married Jerrod.
You're kidding.
She's going to live in Paris.
Really? I'm surprised.
That's wonderful! Icing on the cake.
All my joints seem to hurt and I have a terrible headache.
Have you taken your temperature?
No, Not yet, But I do feel a little feverish.
How long have you been feeling this way?
Only since this morning.
Oh, Probably you've been working too hard.
Maybe you are right.
I'm sick of it, Too.
The door bell doesn't work, There's no hot water, And the building is falling apart.
It's no use complaining. If we had got enough money, We couldn't put up with it, And would have moved out.
Sure.
As in many countries, There's been a big growth in anything related to computers. Young people are attracted to that field in particular. There's also been a big growth in education.
There's been a growth in that field in my country too. A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills.
The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers. They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others.
I noticed that too. What are the people learning?
In my country, They are usually studying something business-related, Such as marketing, Management techniques, And human resource management.
I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future.
That trend has already begun in my country. In particular, There's a big demand for people to work in fitness centers. Which kinds of jobs are less in demand?
Those in traditional fields, Such as agriculture and heavy industry. Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper.
Yes. My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors, But contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors. However, Our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well.
They are well known for high quality, That's why.
Oh, Great!
Which is your favorite in this ten?
I like No. 4.
You mean Sweet Heart.
Yes. In fact, I think it's much better than this week's No. 1.
What do you think about Cold Wind?
I like it as well, But I don't think it's as good as Sweet Heart.
So No. 4 is your favorite. Which one don't you like?
Well. I don't like Your Lips very much.
Why?
I think it's too slow makes me sleepy. In fact, It's the worst in this week's top ten, If you ask me.
Really? But it's my favorite.
Not really. Sometimes, I even let other people make key decision for me.
What kinds of decisions do you leave to other people?
There are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to. I can never seem to choose. I let my parents make big decisions for me. They chose my university and my course. I ended up studying something.
Your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren't careful! Why don't you try being more decisive? Start with some basic ones. When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at,Mak.
That's a good idea. You're very decisive, I'Ve noticed. So, Which bar are we going to this evening?
I can't make a decision. You'll have to put forward an idea.
Ok, I choose luckies.
You see? You're becoming more decisive already!
Why do you say that?
I'Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin.
Really? In my eyes it's normal, As an old man, To be thin is better than to be fat.
Maybe you are right.
Sure, It's easy. First of all, The secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple. People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans. Stick to about three or four points, Give an overview of the points, Then present them one by one, And then summarize at the end. Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered.
What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation? Do you think I should use PowerPoint?
You should consider the size and interests of your audience. In other words, Who is listening, And what do they want to hear... You can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention, But be careful not to go overboard.
I think I can put something together, No problem. But when it comes to tomorrow, I'll just be a bundle of nerves! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public?
You know, Stage fright is very normal, Most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups. Just prepare well,Rehearse beforehand, And trust that you will be great... And you will be!
Wow! Sure!
I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch.
Oh... That's OK... As long as you're buying!
I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about.
I'd love to help if I can.
Well, As you know, I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far, But I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work... Maybe even get a Doctorate!
Wow! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain.
But you have a Master's degree... Hasn't that helped your career?
Yeah, I'd have to say it has. But I'm still paying for it, You know.
I know education is expensive, But it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, But I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name.
Well, Getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that?
I certainly can't afford it, But I'm sure I could find some good student loans.
I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.
Yeah... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate. I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare.
Uh huh, That's for sure. You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students.
Of course not, We'd be happy if you could come. What time will you be able to come?
How about seven o'clock?
Fine. We'll be expecting you.
Oh, I'm a little busy these days.
Why is that?
Don't you know Christmas is coming? I have a lot of things to get ready.
But you're in China. Are you planning on going home for Christmas?
Yeah, So I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave.
Why not just give them money in red envelopes? That would be much easier.
Americans don't like giving money, They prefer presents you buy for them. So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends.
I've got it. I won't bother you any more. You'd better hurry to do it, Christmas is just around the corner.
I will. Merry Christmas.
I have exactly the same feeling. This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me. He knows a lot about investments.
My family is not big, There are only 3 of us-my parents and I.
Who supports the family?
My father supports the family, And he is the sole breadwinner. My mother is a housewife.
Do you live with your family?
Yes, We live a happy life together.
Yeah of course! Although, Don't you ever wonder what “ could have been ”?
What do you mean?
Well, Sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.
For example?
Like for example, If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.
I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.
You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!
Well, I have no regrets!
I'll drink to that!
I asked you if you wanted some help.
I am new to this school and not familiar with this library. Can you help me?
Certainly. What's your topic?
I'm looking for information on tropical fish.
All right. You can use the computer over there, Enter 'tropical fish'under subject. If you know the title of the book, Enter it under' title '..
Great, Thank you.
You are welcome.
At least you haven't landed in the water yet. I've done that on the last two holes.
Could you hand me my wedge? I'll try...
Here you go. I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt.
No. You go ahead and putt it out. Then I'Il go.
No way, Mary. I'm going to let you go first. I don't want the pressure of putting first.
Oh, It is really far from here. You're going in the wrong direction actually.
I must have taken a wrong turn.
It doesn't matter. Go back the way you came. After about five kilometers, You'll see a hotel on the side of the road. It's a big one. You can't miss it.
And then?
Take the next right. Drive about one click further, And you'll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
By the way, How long does it take?
Without traffic, It takes about an hour.
I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon. Do you think I can make it before closing?
Yes, I think so. It doesn't close until 5 o' clock. You still have plenty of time.
Great! Thank you!
My pleasure, And have a good time!
Can't complain. What about you?
Not bad. Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband?
I've heard. She looks quite depressed.
Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.
I heard they were just married for 5 months.
Yes, She said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things.
Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden.
You said it. You know, They fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.
Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.
Yeah. We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners.
Definitely. That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce.
We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners.
That's true. Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon.
Hi, Andy, How are you finding your new job?
Pretty good. My colleagues seem alright. So far everything is great.
That's nice. What do they have you doing over there?
Well, I work in the marketing department. The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer. Before, When I was assigned a task, I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don.
That's really good. It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work.
Indeed. Team work is highly valued in this new company. I like our boss too. He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation. He's highly respected by all his employees.
That's great, That's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees. I wish my boss was like that.
True, Take my former supervisor as an example. He was extremely controlling and overbearing. He always had to micromanage everything.
Well, Now you don't have to worry about that. This new place sounds really good.
Yeah it is.
Thank you, Wendy. I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding.
I'm looking forward to it.
It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having.
Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air.
All right. Let's go.
No, I'm scared of cats.
Oh, But why?
I feel they're dirty.
Really? I'm not sure that I would like all the attention. There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star's private live in recent years.
I love being photographed! If I were famous, I'd do interviews for all the top magazines, Like cosmo and elle.
I wouldn't mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice, But it would get tedious after a while. Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you.
No-one really believes gossip columnists.
I think you'll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns. You'd also have to be very careful about every word you said. If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly, It.
I think you're right about that. I'd need a good manager to be my spokesperson. I could do a lot of charity work, Which would help a lot of people.
That's a great idea. Which charities would you support?
I love children, As you know, So probably a children's charity.
You'd have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity, So you'd really need to be very careful. Anyway, I'd be the first to buy your posters and I'd attend your first book -.
Thanks, But actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography.
Really? There aren't many left now.
No, They've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away.
Were there any animals in the forest?
Yes, I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds. But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here.
No, I'm not clear.
We've spent $ 1, 000.
Don't make a fuss. The price is rising.
I live in the southern part of this city. I rent a house.
Do you move a lot?
No, I don't.
Oh, I forgot to tell you this. The show is to collect money for children in need. And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross.
That's really a good thing. Let's do our part.
Good idea.
Who will sing in the show?
A lot of stars, Including Andy, Justin, Mendy...
Mendy? Are you sure? I love her songs!
Me too. She is so young and talented. She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself.
Yeah. Though she was so popular, I heard she managed to maintain a low profile.
She is a real star. Not a onetime thing.
But I also heard some people didn't like her music. I don't understand why. She is so amazing!
Well, I suppose people have different tastes on music. Moreover, Here stuff is really strong and creative. It takes time for people to accept new things.
You are right. Anyway, Things will be different as the days go on. She can get it. I have faith in her.
Sure. That makes a good fan. Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight?
Here is the programme. Check it out yourself!
Ok.
Photograph.
What's the make of your camera?
Olympus.
Do you own your own darkroom?
No, Usually I get my films developed at a photo studio, But I make my own enlargements.
Why?
Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative. That's more, But that saves money.
Thanks, June. But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I'm allowed to repair cars for a living.
That's not a big problem. There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified.
I guess I never thought of that before.
And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, Or from the government.
Wow, You'Ve inspired me to do something!
It's a huge headache. I have no idea what I want to do.
But don't you want to study music? Shouldn't it be easy?
It should be, But there are too many options. My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices, But after that...
I know. You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, A big school or a small school, A public or private school...
Yup, You understand. And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college. They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline. And the tuition is usually pretty low.
I see. Well, Don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school. He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction. He gave me some information, And next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended.
Thanks for the information. And good luck in your college search.
Why do you say that?
Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long.
Oh, I see. She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters, But not to pour oil on the flame.
She is a clever mother.
Yeah, I quit my job, And started working from home. Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out.
Why? You have a decent salary, Lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o 'clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening.
It's not about pay raise or promotion. You know, I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night.
ThenSOHO is your ideal work style.
Yeah, As long as I have a computer and internet access, I can start working. I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace.
And you don't have to work under that much pressure and control.
Absolutely. I can decide when and what to do all by myself.
Sounds great. Are there many business opportunity?
Yeah, I can find enough online.
It's good to have business around. But you should also do some exercise to keep fit.
Thank you for reminding me. I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project.
I calmed up. And finally, I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision. I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal.
But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that.
How could have the heart to do that? She needs warmth and help.
No way!
In my spare time, I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family.
But traveling is an expensive hobby, Isn't it?
You are deadly right.
Keep in touch!
I promise.
Is she coming?
She told me she'd be here.
They are announcing your flight. You'd better board the plane.
Are you rushing me?
I am just reminding you about the time. You don't want to miss the plane, Do you?
I know what I am doing. Don't worry. Can you do me a favor?
Name it and I'll do it for you.
Take care of Pamela when I am away. She is a nice girl. I don't want her to get hurt or anything.
I've got it.
Thank you. Now I see that you are my true friend. Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt. You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time.
I am just doing what I think I should do.
Thank you for being a friend of mine.
This isn't like you... Well, I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business.
Thank you. I have to leave now. If you see Pamela, Tell her I'll write to her.
It's fine today.
What was the weather like yesterday?
It rained all day yesterday. The weather was awful last week.
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
It's going to be sunny tomorrow.
I don't think so. There's too much competition.
Hi, Bob. I'm reading a biography?
Who's it about?
It's about Bob Dylan.
Who is he?
He's a famous American musician.
Who's the author?
It was written by Howard Sounds.
What do you think about it?
It's great! I'Ve learned a lot from reading it.
Can I read it when you're done?
Sure, Bob! I'm on chapter 12 now, So I'm almost finished.
How many chapters does the book have?
There are 15 chapters in total.
When do you think you'll have finished reading it?
I should be done by Friday. I'll give it to you in class then.
Thanks. Charlie!
No problem. Bob.
What can you expect? Not that good.
What are you going to do then?
Just let it go.
How are your work now?
Not bad, Just let it go.
I thought you were going to let it grow out long.
I said that, Didn't I? But I just don't know what to do with it.
You're in one of those in-between stages, Aren't you.
Yes, It's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy.
Have you thought about wearing a hat?
Everywhere I go?
Well, It's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out!
I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China! Looks like I'm in trouble.
Definitely. I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds! That is nearly a record high!
No way! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation?
Absolutely! I don't think any planes are going anywhere. The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters. But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest.
That's exactly where I was planning to go!
Well, This storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China. At the moment, That area is calmer.
I don't know. You know what they say about office romances.
No, I don't. What do they say about office romances?
They say you shouldn't mix love and work.
That's silly. What I do on my own time is no one else's business. Besides, It's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here.
You'Ve got a point. Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism. Then when the relationship went bad, He fired me.
People fall in love with people they work with. That's a fact.
That may be true, But I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity.
If it does, It will only make you more productive, Because we can support each other.
You are sounding like we are already married.
Good grief. All I did was ask you out. I am sorry.
Well, I don't feel right about it.
I am talking about dinner tonight, Not a lifetime.
Most starts with dinner, But then it gets out of hand. Besides, Haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office?
I like company.
Company? I heard about you from Linda. She said you were an octopus!
What can I say? I am a passionate guy.
Well, I hope you can find something else to be passionate about.
You want to go out with me and you know it.
In your dreams. Now if you don't mind, I've got some work to do.
Ok, I get the message. Hey, Do you have any sisters?
I hope that I can finally find free time too. I'Ve been so busy at work recently.
How might you spend the weekend.
I hope to do a little gardening. I find it very relaxing.
I might do that too. I hope the weather is nice. I could go and play some golf.
I heard that the weather should be good. There's a possibility of a shower, But it's not very likely.
Hopefully, We'll both have relaxing weekends.
Of course, Something could come up and stop that wish coming true.
Unfortunately, There's always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention.
Not every day, But occasionally.
It will make you as fit as a fiddle.
I don't believe ads. What's more, I'm already in perfect health.
Five days a week, Too?
Actually, Five and a half. On Saturday, We have classes only in the morning.
Gosh!
That's too much for us really.
Where are you going now?
I'm going to try to find out where the school is located.
When do you start school?
I'm going to register right now.
That's good.
Well, Thanks all the same, Denise. But no I don't think. Sorry, I'm sure you would enjoy it. I'd like to Denise, But I'm busy on friday this week and next week too.
But I said thursday. The tickets are for thursday evening.
Thursday? Oh, Sorry. I meant thursday too. I mean I busy then too.
I see. Oh, Well some other time perhaps.
Yes. Some other time perhaps. Thanks again.
Nine twenty pm, I couldn't say. I cann't remember.
Are you sure you cann't remember?
I've absolutely certain.
Were you in or out? Can you remember that?
I'm not quite positive. I think I went out at about half pass nine.
Did you see anyone come into the block flats?
No, I didn't.
Sure?
Quite sure.
A boss likes him a lot. He says Jim is a good team player.
Everybody would like to have Jim on their team. Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to.
Maybe we all should learn something from him.
Right.
Poor, Fellow, What's the date today, Buddy?
It's... Oh it's the 1st April, April Fool's Day.
You forgot all of about it, Didn't you?
Thanks.
I'Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross.
Cool! I'Ve always wanted to do something like that! Have you learned anything useful?
For sure! I mean we'Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, How to check for a pulse, And even how to apply CPR!
Have you treated any real emergencies?
Well, They took us along with some paramedics. There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures. His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital. It was intense!
I can imagine! I tend to faint when I see blood, So I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon!
Good morning, Nathaniel. This is Leah calling from the International Student Office.
Good morning.
The reason I'm calling is because Ms. Collins will not be able to call you back until next week.
Oh. I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday.
She's terribly sorry about that. She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week. She hopes you understand.
Is there someone else I can talk to?
She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today. When are you free today?
Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me.
Mr. Liu is available at 2:15 today. Will that work for you?
I'd prefer to speak with Ms. Fonda.
I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon. She has an opening at 11:30 this morning. Will that work for you?
That will be fine.
Ok, We'll be expecting you at 11:30 then. See you then.
That is just an excuse. You can always find some time to exercise.
But I work hard all the time for long hours. Often I have no time for lunch. Yet, I am still getting fatter.
Bill, You know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing. And skipping meals will not help you lose weight. In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals.
I know you're right, But what can I do?
How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night?
But I'll miss the news. It's important in my business to keep up with events in China.
I know, I know. Have you got a portable radio? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time.
That's a good idea!
Oh yeah?
It was one of the best times in my life. It was tough, But I made it. I became a college graduate.
How did you feel when you graduated?
It was a round day for me. My family attend the graduation ceremony. I was so nervous. I couldn't find my cap and gown, But all worked out in the end.
What did you do after graduation?
I was planning to attend gradate school, But then I was offered a good job doing marketing, So I changed my mind.
Sounds like you're happy with your decision.
I sure am. So what about you? How did you feel when you graduated?
It was also a proud day for me, But I also felt like a kind of loss that day.
How could it be?
While seeing others going to work or continue their study, I didn't know what I would do.
You didn't have an offer?
I had one, But I didn't like the job very much. I wanted to attend graduate school, But I was afraid it would be too tough.
I think you lack in the power of decision. Once you make your decision, Don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear. Just go full steam ahead!
Married whom?
If I tell you., You must be completely taken aback.
Come on. Tell me what happened.
He married a girl who is only eighteen!
Is that true? But anyhow, It's none of our business, Isn't it?
Thanks. You too!
Do you have any plans?
Well, My family's away and I can't afford to do much. What about you?
Oh, I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet.
I can speak French and German.
How well can you speak them?
I can speak German quite well, But I can't speak French very well.
Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now?
No, But I'll be able to tomorrow.
Look at this one. It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers.
I'd rather get one with separated speakers. They give a clear sound.
Yes, But we shouldn't get any thing too big. Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture.
That's right. Now this one looks alright? It's a detached or do you prefer this one? It's Sony.
Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration.
You tried to seduce me. I fell for you.
By the way, Are you going to the concert tomorrow?
I am just thinking of it. Maybe I'll go.
I think they must have horrible lives. All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do. They must get sick of it.
I bet they love it really. Sure, They complain about it, But that just gets them more publicity, Doesn't it?
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves. They only want it for their films.
No way! They want publicity for themselves, So that they get invited to make more films, Go to lots of cocktail parties, And even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for Drin.
Show biz stars have plenty of expenses. That's why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, Seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea.
I don't understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They're overpaid, Over-ambitious, And over-adored.
I think you should give them some credit. They're very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves.
Come on! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves.
I just found out that my husband is cheating on me.
You mean Mark? He seems like such an honest guy.
That's what I thought. It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months.
Two months? How did you find out?
I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, And I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately.
So you asked him about the girl who called?
Yeah, He first said it was someone from work. He gave me a lame excuse, And so I pressed him on it.
What'd he do?
He kept trying to make stupid excuses, And then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion.
Indiscretion? How can an indiscretion last two months? I mean, You two have been married for two years! How can he do that to you?
I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn't tell me the truth or end the relationship with her.
Good. I totally agree with what you did.
Palmistry? What is that?
It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future.
Oh, You mean palm reading. I've seen that before, But I don't believe in it.
Are you sure? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?
Really? You've read books about it? Ok, Then. But only if you want to.
Ok, Let's see, Well, You've got a long life line, Which is good, And the love line is strong...
What else do you see? Will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?
Hmm, Hard to say, Wait, Yes, It looks like you will do well in business, And your ambition will help you a lot, But...
What? What is it? What's the matter?
You seem to have a large gullibility line. You believe everything that you're told.
Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, What is your impression of this film?
Well, I think this film is simply a fable, Depicting man's eternal greed for power, And in my opinion, It's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, The animation was very well done, And the story was simply enchanting.
I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, And as you say, The score and songs performed by Elton John were great, The film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, It was too predictable.
Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
Well, That's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example whenMufasal dies, Or the dark, Grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, The film is linear.Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, And teaches children the value of respect, Life and love.
You have always been so soft, Dave!
Open your heart Dick. Don't shut us out.
Anyway... That's all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about & quot, How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot, I'm sure you'll love that one Dave!
Hi, Sterling!
What do you think of our new teacher?
Professor Wood? I think he's a brilliant scientist.
You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?
I guess so.
Miss!
Yeah! May I introduce Mis... Eh... Miss...
My name is Jane Brown!
Oh yeah! Would you please welcome... Miss Jan Brown.
I don't understand. You don't even know the 'friends' you are'talking' to!
It is better I don't know them. So I can say anything I want.
Do you believe what they say?
Who cares? It's just online. It's not real. Do you want to join me tonight?
Thanks, But I'm a lousy typist.
I don't believe it.
And I score three of them.
You are not serious?
We had extra time of course.
I can believe that.
Are you serious?
Yes, I mean it.
But why? Did I do anything wrong?
No, We are just too different. This isn't working.
Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.
I have thought about it for a while. I think it's time to move on for both of us.
But I still love you.
I'm sorry.
I knew this would happen some day...
Then why didn't you talk to me?
Well. It's not all my fault, Anna...
I don't want to argue with you anymore. This is going to be tough, But Let's try and be friends.
I would like that Anna, But I think I'll need a little space for a bit.
I think we'll be better off if we are apart.
Shall we keep pur friendship?
Sure, Let's just be friends.
Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes. Like my cousin, Anna, Who can't stop getting pregnant. She's a lost cause.
Is that your cousin in the back?
Yep. She's always got a bun in the oven. She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church.
What about birth control pills? Don't they work on Italians?
Ha-ha. Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family.
And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos.
I can hardly make ends meet these days.
Same here. I have't brought any new clothes for three months.
My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise.
True. The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities.
Definitely. I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month.
Well, My mum lost her job yesterday.
I'm sorry to hear that. Well, I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year, With more than half being women.
The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole.
Yeah, It's true. What is she going to do?
Well, She is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community.
That's not bad. It could be a short-term alternative. Your mum can look for another one when the market improves. Things will work out eventually.
Thank you. I just hope she won't feel pressed.
I just lost my job. I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been looking for another job?
I just started, But the job market is very bad right now. I'm not optimistic about it.
That's tough. What does your wife think about this?
She's trying to be supportive, But I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well.
I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job. I'll see what they can do.
I really appreciate your help.
No problem. In the meantime, Don't try to worry so much. You'll get through this.
Ok, Go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?
Actually, I did it, But then it got lost.
Could you have gotten it done at another time?
Yes, I could.
You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up?
I'll make it up early next week.
That would work, But don't let it happen again.
I'll try.
That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again.
Certainly I do.
It seems you're very fond of it.
I'd be happy to do something new.
Isn't it wonderful here? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool. I hope it's safe.
Don't worry about them. They're very responsible. Besides, There are many people there and there's lifeguard employed by the hotel. Waiter! Could I have another drink pleas? Thank you. So, What shall we do this evening?
The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel. There's a special one just for kids.
So, We could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook. Then we could go to a club. We haven't been to one for ages.
That's a great idea. We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids.
Now, How about going for a swim in the sea? We shouldn't sunbathe all day.
Hi, Tom. Want a cup of coffee?
Not right now. I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up.
Oh, Hey, Did you look in the classified ads?
You mean used car?
No, Ah... Single sellers.
Well, Yeah, But I'd be getting somebody else's problem.
Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now.
It's the same kind of deal though, You know, You never know what you're going to get.
Oh, Hey, How about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car.
Let's look at them all. Have you got a paper there?
You look lost. Can I help you?
Aren't you the guy who sat in front of me in our homeroom?
Yeah. I'm Brad.
I'm Mary. I can't find my American literature class.
What room is it?
It's 112.
It's on the first floor by the nurse's office.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I've got to go before the bell rings.
I suspect it's unavoidable.
Poor Ann. She did not love her husband at all.
Yeah. She married him at her mother's bidding.
How much do you want?
200yuan. I bought a computer online, So I have to pay the mortgage.
I am so sorry to hear that. Is that enough?
It's so nice of you. You really make my day.
Forget it! We seemingly need to gather money little by little.
What you said is absolutely right. I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet.
No rush. You can give it back whenever you have it.
Generally speaking, Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones.
May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark?
Possibly.
How nice of you to remember!
Oh, Here's a little token of my affection.
You're so thoughtful. Thank you.
Where do you need to be that is more important than school?
I have an appointment.
Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?
No, But I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work.
Are you going to go right away?
I am leaving right now.
All right, But please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up.
Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of.
Goodbye, And try not to miss any more school.
Yes, Very. I thought the last speaker was especially good.
Let me introduce myself, By the way. My name's Thomas Bradley.
How do you do? I'm Ted Nugent.
Sorry, What was your last name again?
It's Nugent, N-U-G-E-N-T, But just call me Ted.
Ok, I'm Tom.
Glad to meet you.
And what do you do, Ted?
Me? I'm in the car business.
Salesman?
Yes, That's right. And how about you?
I work for American Airlines.
Oh, Really? What do you do there exactly?
I'm in the Personnel Department.
Really? There aren't many left now.
No, They've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away.
Were there any animals in the forest?
Yes, I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds. But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here.
What does his dad say?
John is a peacemaker. He simply doesn't bother. He says he should give him a free hand.
Well, The first year of our marriage, We had great difficulty getting along. The things that are important to me are not important to him. We had a lot of conflicts.
Yeah, I know what you mean. The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples, Not to mention two people from different cultures.
And now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart.
Oh, So he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, Then?
Right now he speaks mostly Chinese, And he can say a few English words. But he will learn.
What does he look like? Can people tell?
Yes, People surely can. He's whiter than the Chinese kids, And his hair is a little blonde. My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though.
I'd like to very much.
All right, Then. There is one at the new concert hall.
Who's playing?
It's the Powell orchestra.
Do you know what they are playing?
They're doing a seventeenth-century program.
And who is directing?
Well, I'm not sure of his name, But I know it's going to be his farewell performance.
Yeah, Cal Ripen just hit a home run.
What's the score?
Well it was 3 to 4, But Ripen's home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base.
So Baltimore is winning?
Right.
This is a really great place to watch a baseball game.
Yeah, There isn't a bad seat in the place.
The fans are great here, Too. Not like in Philadelphia.
It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game.
Yeah, It reminds you why they say baseball is America's favorite pastime.
Could you stay a little longer?
Sorry, I can't. My mother doesn't want me to be late. I really have to go.
In that case, I won't keep you. Remember to give me a call.
Thank you for your delicious meal.
I think it's the most successful film in scene-setting and music.
You bet it.
Sure did. It's a beauty. Where do you want it?
Let's put it over there.
Let's go to work. We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening.
Let's string the lights first. Then we won't have to mess up the decorations.
Hand me some globes and paper flowers, I'll put them on these top branches.
There,... We're about done.
Let's switch the lights on.
Ok. Here goes.
Well, I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas.
Sure, Great effect. My weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120.
Congratulations! That's really something beyond my imagination.
How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means?
Shut up. You should think how to make fortunes, Not look for a squabble.
Ok, You name the day.
How about the second of March?
What day is that?
It's Friday.
Good. Where shall we meet?
What is wrong with you?
Tom is making so much noise. I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening.
You can talk with him.
She works as a teller in a bank.
Does she go to night school?
Yes. She goes three times a week.
Why? What does she want to be?
She wants to be a manager.
What classes does she take?
She takes classes in accounting and business.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Wilson.
Tim, Please. Please be seated.
Thank you.
So, Wily, You have been with IBM for two years ready for change?
Well, I think I'm ready for new challenges.
I started to date someone recently, But it didn't work out.
That's too bad. What happened?
Well... That's a long story.
Come on, Just a little piece.
Do you know how many people chew gum everyday?
I have no idea.
Just in Beijing, People consume 300, 000 pieces of gum every day.
That's amazing.
If all the people spit out the gum like you, The whole world would become a big trash can.
Come on, You are making too big deal out of this.
I just want to remind you to behave yourself.
Ok, Dear sister, I see. This kind of thing will not happen again.
Yeah, I just need to make the final touches.
How long until you're finished?
I'm finished. What do you think?
I like my hair so much.
Do you really?
It's beautiful.
Well, Thank you very much.
How much is it for my hair?
You owe me $ 55.
Thanks for everything.
You are very welcome. Come back again.
I'm glad to help you. What's wrong?
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L. A. Hank and I will be flying there tonight.
I'm sorry to hear it. What's wrong with her?
Doctors aren't sure yet. But the real problem is Suzy. She has a bad cold, And we don't want to take her with us. But we don't know who can stay with her.
You need a babysitter.
Yes, I'd ask Jill, The girl I've had before, But I need someone overnight. Maybe even for two nights.
I could have Suzy stay at my place.
I don't want to do that to you, Karen.
Why not?
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold. I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here. But I don't know who to ask. I need someone more mature than Jill. It might even be for two or three days.
I know who we can ask. There is a girl I know, Sara Ralston. She is 17, And she will usually take this kind of job. I know her from my church, And I trust her completely.
I'd like to talk with her. This is short notice, I know. But Hank and I are leaving tonight.
I'll get you her number. I hope she can do it. She is very responsible.
I'm glad you know someone. I knew you would be the best person to ask about this. I don't want to insult Jill or her mother. I think Jill maybe could do it. But I'd rather have someone a little older.
I'll go home and get Sara's number. I'll call her first myself.
Great. Then call me and let me know if she's free.
Oh... I bet the firm is fuming. Do they know who spilled the beans?
I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details.
What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible?
I'm sure there'll be canned! And there also might be some legal consequences.
Why would the person who told have problems with the law?
Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality.
I didn't think about that. That's pretty serious. Are there investigators working on finding out who it was?
I'm sure management is on top of it.
That's because you cheated.
I never cheat.
Yes, You do.
Oh, Hi Lucas, Come on in. I'm Barbara. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Would you like something to drink? I've got tea and some grape juice.
Thanks. Some tea would be nice. Chinese tea is great. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it?
Oh, There is a supermarket not far from here. But there is also a tea house around the corner, Where you can get tea, Taste tea and get a tea set as well.
Oh yeah, I saw the tea house the other day. I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here.
You are right about that. It's quiet and very convenient. You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes 'walk. There's a grocery store, A book store, A gym, And many restaurants along the street.
There's a gym nearby? That's exciting! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible. I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight.
Well, If you want we can go together sometime. Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon, If you like, You can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way.
That would be wonderful. Thanks!
I like basketball. I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV.
Who's your favourite player?
I don't really have one but I support Huston.
Do they have a good team?
I think they do, But I'm biased. They have a good manager and a great coach.
I can't keep up with the game. The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing.
I have the same problem. The players are really very skilful. I wish I could play that well.
You play for an amateur team, Don't you?
Yes, I do. We're doing pretty well this season. We'Ve won most of our games, But we're not top of the league table.
How many more games are there this season?
We'Ve got four more games. I hope we can win all of them.
Why not?
I have to see my daughter.
When poyou have to see her?
I have an appointment at one fifteen.
How old is he?
Twelve. He's very sensible for his age.
You're telling me.
Oh, I was out sick most of last week. I'm still not completely over it. You'd better not get too close!
I'm sorry to hear about that. Why don't you join me for a hot cup of tea? It'll be good for you!
Sure, Why not? I could use a rest.
Oh, I went on a holiday in the city of Chende.
Great. What do you think of it?
The city is small, Not very modern, But there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city, So the air there is pretty fresh.
Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort?
Certainly! The most attractive place is that, It's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace. The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it.
It sounds great, And is it really cool there?
Yes, I think the reason is that there is a big lake, And many trees in the Resort.
What is the special local product?
The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond. The mushroom tastes really good, And it is very different from the common mushrooms, And the snack made of almond is delicious.
I hope to go there someday.
Yeah, It's must for me.
But don't forget to give me a ring.
I won't, Mom.
Take care of yourself.
I will. Bye, Mom.
Bye, My boy.
Oh really? Is he all right?
Not so good, Though his nephew took him to hospital in time.
Poor old John! I am ever so sorry.
Mind your own business.
Yes, I heard it's supposed to come out in June. Are you thinking about getting one?
I'd like to. It's a cell phone, Camera, PAD and mp3 player all in one.
If I had enough money, I'd buy one, But I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods.
How big is a shuffle iPod?
The first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first.
How many gigs of music can it hold?
I think it's either one or two gigs. I can't remember.
How much do they cost?
Not much at all. I think it's about 100 dollars.
You're right, That's not bad at all.
Do you have an iPod?
I got one for my birthday when they first came out, But after the battery died out, I never brought another one.
Why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it?
That's one of the problems with having an iPod. Though an iPod might have an above average battery life, Once the battery is dead, So is your iPod.
I can't deny that. She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight. I wish I knew more about her.
But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl.
I can not belive that. It must be cooked up by someone.
I'm looking for this book.
Is there something wrong?
I don't see it on the shelf.
Did you check the computer?
I already looked.
Did it say anything?
It said that the book is on the shelf, But it isn't.
I'm sure I can get it from another library.
Could you do that?
I'll let you know when I get the book in.
That's great. Thank you so much.
Bob and Mary are back together.
I'm glad to hear it.
Me too, They're such a nice couple.
I didn't have any big plans.
We are putting together a birthday party for Mary.
That sounds like fun. Where will it be?
We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house.
Oh good! Can I bring anything?
We will be providing hot dogs, Hamburgers, And cake, But people can bring side dishes.
I am assuming that the dress is casual.
Dress casually and bring your bathing suit!
Wonderful. Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there.
Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with?
Yeah, That's her. We had a lot of wonderful times together. She is really a special friend, And I want to get her something meaningful.
I am not good at picking gifts. Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier?
I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last.
Yeah, That's nice.
Hmm, I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home.
A plant? That's creative. I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you. But there is a problem. Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs?
I hope so. I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase. I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border.
I don't know. I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer. You don't want to get her in trouble.
Yes, I like collecting things.
Oh, That's interesting, And but what kind of things?
Several things, For example, Various coins, Stamps, Stones and so on.
Stones? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones?
Yes, Stones.
Well, I can't just image it.
Count me out.
Morning Sally! What's up? You seem in a hurry!
I am having an exam at nine, It's already eight thirty.
Don't worry, I'll drive you.
Thank you very much!
How are your cases coming along?
Very well, Thanks, I will probably finish next week, But this is still a lot of work, I have been worked on in for six months, And i'm so closed to end. I can feel it.
Wow, Good for you. It sounds like a lot of work. I'm proud of you! Is this the right building?
Yes, It's only eight forty. Thanks so much!
You're welcome. Good luck, Bye!
Have a nice day, Bye!
Happy birthday, George. Many happy returns of the day. Here's a present for you.
Oh, Thank you, Mary. You're so nice.
I hope you like it. Oh, Have the other guys arrived?
They're all waiting for you. Let's join them. I'm going to cut the cake soon.
Let's go.
You only need to tell me that once.
Because I'm not in the mood, That's why.
Well, Don't just sit there, Do something. Come and help me in the kitchen.
Help you in the kitchen, I don't feel like it.
Would you like to clear the table then?
Really? Do I have to do it?
Not, If you don't want to.
Well, Isn't there anything you want?
Yes, I want to go out. Would you like to come?
No, Why should I? I don't feel like it. Besides, I'm in such a bad mood.
Thank you.
So it is really worth your great effort. And hope you can keep the record you've made today.
I will try my best.
These are my roses. The roses have been in flower for a week.
The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom. You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers.
Yes, You are right. I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them. I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends.
You did a good job. But I got tired of working in the garden.
Oh, I see. People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well. I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day. In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected.
Yes. Thanks.
Honey, Don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary, Did you?
Oh, My dear, How can I forget such an important day? I was just kidding. Look at this box.
What's in it?
Have a guess.
A necklace?
No.
I have no idea.
Open it now.
Oh, My god. A diamond brooch. It's so beautiful. You're so kind to me, A. Thank you!
You're welcome, Honey. I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future.
Forget it! If you think I'd ever set foot that inferior restaurant again, You gotta be nuts. Last time I ate that food, Almost vomited. The service in there is terrible. It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter.
Yeah, Not seeing a single person anywhere informed me. Hey! How about that one over there?
Oh, Give me a break! That place is too lavish for us.
Easy. It's on me.
In that case, I'm right behind you.
I went a global warming rally in London. It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment.
Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already?
It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, But there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening.
Like what?
Well, We can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.
What else can we do to protect the environment?
If you do have to drive, You should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, Your home should use sources of renewable energy.
How about recycling? Does that actually help?
Yes. You should take your glass, Paper, Plastic, Cardboard, And tin cans to a recycling center.
What do you think is the biggest worry for our future?
I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone.
I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before!
To be honest, In order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place, We're all going to have to become more interested in the environment.
Because I like him.
Me, Too. I think he's really a shoulder to cry on.
No, I just check my weight, I'm getting fatter.
True, You are getting a really pot belly, Aren't you?
I'll get you for that comments, George.
Just kidding, Mikel. Why don't you come work out with me?
Ah, I don't know a fit works. Last time, All I saw the gym were bunch of lidos, Like me.
It works if you keep at it. Come on, Let's go!
All right. But so help me it's a better work.
This feels great. I'm allreed up. I can keep going all night.
Not me. I'm too hot and I'm too tired.
Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig.
Well, That's not for me.
Thanks for coming, It was a real blessed.
It wasn't as good as you think.
You'll get used to it, Mikel, Trust me.
Thank you. I'm wearing make-up.
Who taught you to put on make-up?
It's me. I have studied make-up at a beauty shop.
Can you teach me how to do make-up?
Of course. First, Use eye shadow to heighten your eyes.
What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me?
I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls.
How do you protect yourself from chapped lips?
I suggest you use lipstick, Which also accentuates your lips.
How did you grow such long nails?
You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time.
Stop fussing! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers. And my company also informs me to attend the training next week.
But for me, The training is waste of my precious time.
I disagree with you. Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings, So as to improve new comers 'understanding of the company and its rules in short time. Through the training, We get to know many things, Such as the corporate culture and spirit. Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company.
I am.
What has made you so happy?
I think I'm in love.
Are you? Who's the lucky girl?
Her name is Jenny.
How did you meet her?
We are in the same math class. Our teacher sat us next to each other.
What do you like best about her?
She's very funny. She makes me laugh all the time.
I guess it was fate working to bring you together.
Whatever brought us together, I'm happy.
I have no idea, Any suggestions?
We haven't played chess for a long time. How about playing chess?
It must be fun. But you know, I am not good at chess. I never won since I've learnt to play chess.
Don't worry, I will teach you how to win.
Ok, Settled then.
See you tomorrow.
See you!
Cinct de mayo?
No, That's May fifth in Spanish, James, No wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers' Day.
Do we get a day off from school then?
No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, But in other countries it is.
Www, Man!
In the nineteenth century, Working conditions were appalling, With workers being forced to work ten, Twelve, And fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, Despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, And by April 1886, 250, 000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, So labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work. And, On May First 1886, The resolution took effect.
Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?
Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, Police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, Killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.
And then what happened?
Well, As we say, The rest is history...
It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months.
How in the world did you get a copy? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn.
I checked it out of the rental library. It only costs five cents a day.
Is it really worth paying for?
I can't tell yet. I haven't got beyond the first chapter.
If it's any good, I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition.
It was wonderful, But I was so tired.
Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
Yes, That was the first thing we did. We went all the way to the top. There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there.
What else did you see?
Art galleries, Cathedrals, Statues, Fountains, Palaces, Bistros, There's really too much to say.
You must have had a great time.
Yes, At the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun. However, On the third day of travelling in the city, I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening.
Yes. You need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad. Sometimes new food might disagree with you.
On the fourth day, We went to taste the French cuisine. That was really fantastic. And no stomach problems.
That is great. Everyone says French food is wonderful.
You'll have to try for yourself some day.
Thank you very much. I will devote all my efforts to my work.
No, I wasn't. I came here in 1992.
How old were you?
I was seventeen.
So, Did you go to college right away?
No, Because my English wasn't very good. I studied English for two years first.
Wow, Your English is really fluent now.
Thanks. Your English is pretty good, Too.
Yeah, But I was born here!!.
Yes, Would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight?
Sure. There is a folk concert tonight.
Are there any good seats left?
Sorry. There are only some seats in the back.
Well, What time does it begin?
It begins at 7 p.M...
Ok. I see.
How many tickets do you want?
Just two.
Ok. Fifty yuan for each.
Here is the money.
What're the teams?
Brazilian against AC Millan.
I bet AC Milan will lose.
Yes, I also felt that. I'm always busy, And have no time for rest. I don't know how to make use of time.
Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next, And follow it.
That's a good idea. And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things.
You are right. Let's stop idling around and do something.
Yeah, Time is money. We really need to make good use of it.
Haven't been sleeping well recently.
What's the problem?
Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night. I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings.
Well, You can simply tell them you want to sleep, Or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down.
Yeah, I know, But I find these sorts of things hard to say. They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV. Now I just hope the show will end soon.
I understand. I used to live in a dorm with four people. I was great in some aspects. We always went out and and had fun together. But on the other hand, When I wanted some quiet time, And people kept.
Yeah, I crave my own space. I just so tired of having people around me all time.
So soon? Why don't you stay a little longer?
I wish I could, But it's already late.
Oh, It's a pity that you have to leave.
Thank you for a wonderful meal.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Yeah.
Why don't you speak English?
Oh, My mother is a German, So I can speak German.
Oh, Do you like Chinese?
Yeah, I'm eager to learn Chinese, But it is too difficult for me.
I want to study German. Can we exchange lessons?
Very Good. I'd like to do that.
When will we begin?
How about tomorrow night?
That's all right.
I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now.
If I can do anything for you, Don't hesitate to let me know.
Thank you.
Oh, Thank you so much.
Really, It was nothing.
I really appreciated it.
I was happy to help.
It was so kind of you.
Don't mention it.
You're a real friend in need.
I've been away on a vacation.
I bet you had a wonderful time.
Yeah, Beautiful sunshine, Pleasant scenery and many new friends.
Sounds great.
Yes.
If I were in your position, I wouldn't give up an inch.
I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion.
Yes. I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake.
Oh, Do you go hiking often?
I go as much as I can. I love hiking, Because you can really get in touch with nature.
It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?
Sure. But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?
Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike.
Wow. You must have been pretty far away from the city.
Yeah, My friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.
Well, Bring him along to. We will have a great time this weekend.
Thanks. I will ask him.
Yeah, About 5 minutes ago.
Who's winning?
The Bulls, Of course!
What! That wasn't a foul! C 'mon, Ref!
Don't worry, Shan always screws up free throws.
You were right! He didn't make the shot!
That was a great shot! A three pointer, Yeah!
Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!
This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, Open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!
Okay... End of the first quarter... Alright, I'm gonna make a beer run.
Not so bad, But Kevin does have problems with his wife.
What?
His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion.
Poor Kevin, We should do something for him. He is a nice guy and does his job well.
Yeah, I agree with you. But you know, It's just one of those things.
Mom, It's orange?
Wow, My son is so clever.
Mom, That's a stupid question.
Really?
I am not a child at all. I know more.
Oh, My son looks like a grown-up.
Sure. Mom, I can take care of you.
No kidding. So tell me what's your favorite color?
I like blue. You see, That's the color of the sky. I wanna be a superman.
Why?
I hope I can fly to any place like superman. So I can touch the sky.
Ok, Superman. Put on your cape, We are going to fly home.
Don't mention it, Let's go in.
Yeah, This place looks great. Wow, Look at her, She can certainly get down, Can't she?
She sure can. Are you jealous, Leslie?
A little, I wish I could do that.
You can! With a little practice.
Look at him, He's buff.
I think he's hot too.
How do they all get in suchtiptop shape?
Exercised over and over. Exercise is a key.
That's it. I decided to turn over a new leaf. I'm going to exercise every single day.
Good for you, Leslie!
Yes, Do you like it?
I love it! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar. Is it in good condition?
It looks good on the outside, But the inside is a different story. It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again.
What's wrong with it?
Well, First of all, It needs a new engine, Which is extremely expensive.
When's the last time you had it serviced?
It must have been a few years ago now.
I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.
They do. Once my son was born, There was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, You know!
What else is wrong with it?
The heating controls don't work anymore, So it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer!
Anything else?
The brakes don't really work that well anymore either.
Why don't you get it all fixed?
It costs more than you think to run a car, Especially when there are so many things wrong with it!
Well, Let me know when you can get it fixed. I'd love to go for a ride in it!
I think we would be able to make it. What time shall we come?
About 7 o'clock.
Shall we bring any thing? Some wine?
No, Not really. Just bring yourselves. We would like to your presence.
Speaking. Who's calling, Please?
Hi, Mary. This is Tom.
Oh, Hi, Tom. How've you been?
Just fine. I say. Aren't you busy tomorrow evening?
Let me see. Uh-huh... No, I guess I'll be free.
Well, Uh... Why notdine out together and go to the movies?
Sounds like a good idea.
Okay. I'll pick you up at 6:00.
Thank you for inviting me. See you then. Bye, Tom.
I'm afraid that's not my cup of tea. I just find skin-diving attracting.
So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town?
Yes, There must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?
I love fruit flavoredices the best.
I know, Fresh fruit flavored is the best ever.
What is your least favorite ice cream?
I don't like peppermint ice cream.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
One time, I tried garlic ice cream.
That could be interesting.
That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though. Let's order!
Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room.
Hi, Good morning, You are so early today.
Yes, Traffic wasn't much today, So I made it to the office earlier.
I see. How long does it take you to reach the office every day?
Well, About an hour or so.
Wow, That's quite a long journey. Do you drive a car?
No. I take public transportation. It's safer.
You are right! But I get up a little late. That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle.
Well, Both have advantages and disadvantages.
Me too. Recently, I'm fascinated with net-chat. I've made many friends on the net. Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them. I really enjoy it.
Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money?
I'm afraid not. Every coin has two sides. I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction.
Sure. A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet. If you think about it, Our space shuttles are UFOs.
I've never thought about it like that before.
I've seen photos of UFOs in America before, But they've all looked doctored up.
Do you think that there's life on other planets?
I think there must be.
Why is that?
I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world. The world is just far too big for that.
Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us?
No, But we're trying to contact them.
I suppose you're right.
I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet, Humankind will not become extinct.
Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day?
There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will, But I don't think it's going to happen any time soon.
I don't mind shopping for food and other daily needs.
What do you think of big department store?
It's fun walking around them, But their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need.
Oh, It's lovely. Think of the nasty weather we had last week.
How are you these days?
Fine, Thank you. And you?
Fine today, Though a bit under the weather last week.
Jake just broke up with me.
I'm sorry. When did this happen?
Yesterday. I didn't even know it was coming. He just told me he found someone else.
What a jerk. He doesn't deserve you.
But it still hurts. I thought I loved him.
He didn't treat you that well either. Maybe you don't want to hear this, But I think you can do better.
Better or worse, It doesn't matter. I had a lot of feelings for him. I really liked him.
It must be really painful. I remember when Josh and I broke up. I was crying for a week.
I know. I'll get over him. My first break up was painful because I was naive.
Exactly. You'll find someone again. You should get your mind off of this. Let's go shopping.
Maybe tomorrow. I don't feel like it tonight.
How about coffee down the street?
Sure.
So what? I got a ninety-nine.
Oh, I make a phone call once a month.
It's very expensive, Right?
Yeah.
Why not send E-mail through the Internet?
Is it convenient and cheap?
Sure. You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet. In addition, You can make a phone call through the internet, Too.
Really? I'm so glad to hear that. But I don't know how to get access to the Internet. Could you show me?
No problem. I'll tell you.
I'll appreciate it very much.
Yes, I need to apply for a parking permit.
Are you a professor?
What? Are you kidding? I'm only 22 years old!
Yes, I am kidding. But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits?
Yes, I know. I have a disability. My hip was broken last year. And I can't walk well.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
It's alright. You didn't see me walk to the desk.
Here is the application form. I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university.
My permission letter?
Yes, The letter that certifies you have a disability. And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place.
I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office.
Yes. Or you can bring it yourself.
But I asked them to send it to you directly.
Let me look in the file then. Maybe we received it.
My name is Derek Schneider,S - C - H - N - E - I -D - E - R.
Yes, Here it is. Alright. Then I just need your completed application form, And I will be able to process your request.
Good. I will sit over there and fill out the form. I will give it to you in a few minutes. Oh, By the way, Can I apply for any parking lot I want?
The form has a map on the back. You may specify your top four choices. We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening.
I see. Thank you.
You're very welcome.
We'd better go out for a walk.
Which season do you like best?
Spring.
How about summer?
I dislike it most.
Why?
Because the hottest season is summer in a year.
But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.
Yes, We'll be there, Come hell or high water!
Really? Tell me about some of the plants they showed.
Well. There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them.
Is that type of plant found in this country?
No, It isn't. It's a pity, Because I'd like to see it in action.
So would I. What other unusual plants did they show?
They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, When the insect collects the nectar, It also takes some pollen from one flower to another.
That's very specialized. So, The insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, The other would too.
That's right. That's one reason why it's so important to protect every species.
I see. The plants that fascinate me most are cacti. I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions.
According to the documentary, They have an incredible ability to find water supplies, However small, And then store them without losing much through evaporation.
That's why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves, To reduce water loss.
What's that?
Jenny is getting married.
Great! Who's the bridegroom?
Tom, That lucky guy.
The guy always hands the girls in a line. When did he propose?
Last week, It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs. Whit's party last Monday as soon as he saw her.
My gosh! How romantic! When's the big day?
July 4, The National Holiday.
Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony?
Jenny plans to hold it in church.
Who is the best man?
Guess!
Nobody is OK, But you!
You know, Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man.
Did you promise him?
Yes, I did.
Well, I would say that I'm just drifting - - here, In the pool.
Why?
Well, It's very comfortable just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.
Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
You got me.
Now listen, Ben. Look, I think it's a very good thing that a young man — after he's done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, And lie around, And drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
No. But I'm working on it.
Class starts in twenty minutes. You have to turn it in at the beginning of class today.
I know. I know!
Do you think you can finish it on time?
Don't worry. I'll get it done very soon. I'm almost finished.
You'd better hurry!
Well, It would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me.
Sorry!
We still have to do about ten more.
Well. I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day. And it's about time to clock out.
I know. Maybe we can finish it tomorrow.
Why not! These orders are not urgent. We could do it first thing tomorrow morning.
All right. Let's call it quits and go home.
See. Great minds think alike.
Yes, I did, I thought it was a failure.
Do you really think so? I don't think so. It wasn't that bad film at all. Didn't you hear the applause of the audience?
Well, Maybe so. But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion.
Well, I don't see the point of arguing this.
Yeah. Why not?
Because... I heard John got married yesterday.
Oh, You went to the wedding?
No, He didn't tell me about it. Don't feel bad.
I'm OK. I promise. Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time.
You should go to the library to find some information about American universities, And write to the Admission Office. Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials. From experience, Many applicants write to several universities instead of just one.
I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply.
That is true. I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities. First of all, You need official transcripts of your undergraduate work, Three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence, And the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ). Then you need a financial guarantee, And an application fee of 25 dollars.
What's to come next?
If they agree to enroll you, They will send you aTAP - 66 Form. WithTAP - 66, You can apply for a passport from our government, And then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing.
How long will it take to go over all the procedures?
From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well.
Thank you. I appreciate all your help.
You are welcome. Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
What do you mean?
I was just thinking about you the other day.
You were?
Really? Why would you worry about me? I'm just fine.
You're almost 70 years old, Mom! Don't you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us?
No way! I like my apartment, And I like to be independent.
Do you ever get lonely living alone?
Not at all. I see you and your family twice a week, And I enjoy seeing my own friends. I'm too busy to feel lonely!
You mean Armistice Day.
Well, As you know, On November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, Also known as the Armistice Treaty. This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers 'Day. In Poland it's their independence day! There's a lot going on around the world on this day.
Wow, I didn't know! Probably because I flunked history in school.
Yes, He is running for class president.
I don't believe you.
Take my word for it.
Don't worry. He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it. My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day. He's really absorbed by the discussions.
That's exactly like my wife. She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards.
I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction. Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information.
Sure. What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past? For example, Do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times?
It was held in 776 B. C. At Olympia. It also has a long history of more than 2700 years.
Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time?
Yes, There were no games in 1916, 1940 and 1944, Because of World War I and World War II.
I see. Look, Do you know what that emblem means? I've seen it so many times, But I don't know what it stands for.
Oh, It's the Beijing 2008 Olympics 'Emblem. It's a Chinese seal, Meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world.
I see. I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games.
Sure.
How do you pay for it?
I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments.
Tell me if you need help.
I like the freedom of summer with no school.
Yeah, And all those fun summer sports and activities.
And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year.
Oh, Me too! All the family getting together...
And I really like the smells and colors of spring.
I like the feeling then that school is almost over!
But I must say, If it were only for the weather, I like autumn most!
Why?
Her father is dying.
Oh, That's very sad.
Yeah, She's broken up about it, Poor kid.
What did you do?
I talked to her for a while, But she's really depressed. So, I made an appointment with the school counselor for her.
That's a good idea. The counselor is a psychologist. He's better trained to handle these sorts of things.
Yeah, That's what I told her. I'm glad she's reaching out for help, Instead of trying to deal with this on her own.
Yeah, Me too.
Oh. Yes. It is.
Shall I light the stove?
That's a good idea.
Well. What's the climate like in your country?
It's mild. But it's not always pleasant.
Which season do you like best?
I like spring. The days are long and the nights are short. The flowers in blew. We go on picnics.
Good afternoon, Tina.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
I'm not sure yet. And you?
I would like to go skating. Feel like going with me?
Is skating interesting?
I think so. Fresh air, White snow. It's so comfortable.
But I can't skate well.
It doesn't matter, I can teach you.
It's very kind of you.
Yes, I can.
It is interesting, Isn't it?
Yes, It's very interesting.
Can you teach me?
Sure. Take the tennis racket. Now, Throw the ball up, And hit it with the racket. Like this.
Let me try. Oh, I missed!
Throw the ball up high.
High?
Yes, Very high. Over your head. Then you will have time to hit the ball.
Oh! I hit it.
Well done!
Thank you. I think I like playing it.
Not bad at all, Thanks. There were one or two interesting people there. Why couldn't you come?
Well, I couldn't get away from work early. And when. I got home I had a headache, So I had to go straight to bed. But I was over-tired, Because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours.
What a shame. Why didn't you take a sleeping pill?
I don't like them. I used to take them when I had to work overtime, You know.
How many did you use to take?
Three every night.
Good heavens. Why did you take so many?
Because I was under a terrible strain. The doctor saidthey weren't very strong. Anyway, I used to feel awful the next morning.
I'm sure you did.
The doctor said I had to be careful.
He was quite right.
So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead.
It sure is. The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece. No man could ever make anything like this.
What is that below?
It is the Colorado River. You can go down the river in a boat if you wish.
No. Thank you. It looks a bit too dangerous for me.
There is a beautiful state park here. I can see why so many people come out here to camp.
Yes, There is beautiful view. You can go fishing, Camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air.
It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city.
That's true.
Yeuks! Do they know anything about me?
Actually, I've told them a lot about you. They are excited to meet you.
I'm a little nervous!
I think you'll like them. My family is pretty laid back.
How Ay people will be there at dinner?
Let's see. There's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters.
That's good, I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families.
Yes, I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department.
What are you majoring in?
I'm majoring in English.
Is it difficult to learn?
Yes. The language is hard to learn, But it's interesting.
Do you know anything about Britain and America?
I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture.
Right. It's important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well.
You're right.
Thanks. It's a lot better than mine, And it's new.
Where are you going?
We're going to visit my sister in the city.
I didn't know your sister lives in the city, When did she move there?
About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, Across from the public library.
I see. It's almost 5:00 PM now, Don't you think there will be a lot of traffic?
Oh, We're not driving. We're going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes.
Yes, But it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.
I take the subway to work everyday, So I'm used to it now.
Doesn't your mother live in the city?
Yes, She's lived there for about ten years.
I remember when she moved there. Apartments were a lot cheaper then.
I know what you mean. It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now.
Have a good time. Next time you're free, Give me a call and we'll go play poker.
See you later.
So soon. It seems as if you just got here.
I feel that way, Too. But all good things must come to an end, As they say.
It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories.
I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around.
It was fun for me, Too. It gave me a chance to get away from my routine.
You'll be out to see me next year, As you promised?
Oh, Yes. I should be there some time next spring.
I'll be expecting you then.
The lecturer is dull, Too.
I feel he's like a talking machine.
I feel the same way.
Cool! The sound is great. These earphones are awesome!
And they're really safe. They'll protect your ear from sound damage.
You certainly need that. You always pump the volume up way too high.
I know. And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music.
You're right! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike!
I'm almost done.
I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago.
I'm all done now.
Are you sure you're finished?
I don't understand.
You did a horrible job on my hair.
What's wrong with it?
I don't like anything about it.
I apologize.
That's fine, But I'm not paying for it.
Excuse me? Let's try to work this out, Okay?
My watch says half past five.
Does your watch keep good time?
Oh yeah. It loses only a few seconds in the whole month.
Thanks a lot.
From my own experience as a career woman, I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be, It is still a widespread problem. Society is changing, But there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks.
Do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs? Or are there more issues coming into play?
I think it's a very complicated issue. A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers. Don't underestimate the good ole 'boy system. Men have power, So it's easier for them to stay in power.
What about affirmative action? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy?
Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination, But it's still a man's world.
What do you mean, Mr. Smith? You said to make it brief.
Don't get smart with me. Here, Do it again, But do it right this time.
No, Thanks. I'm full.
Poor man, He must be terribly fed up with it.
Oh, No, He likes the job.
Oh, Really?
Thank you, Rick! As you can see, Ladies and gentleman, We are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars!
Whoa, That's a lot of cash! Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.
All right, We are here at the eighth hole. It's a par four, And has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole!
Tiger Woods is about to tee off, And let's see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, He seems to be very nervous.
Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It's definitely not his day today. On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees. He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.
Oh no! A bear! Run, Tiger, Run! Somebody call animal control!
He's still pretty sick.
That's too bad. What does he have?
We don't know, But he's going to the doctor tomorrow.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Thanks a lot. I'll tell him.
Of course, How can I help you?
I want to know if I am doing OK.
Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?
I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well.
I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, But not so well in others.
I think I could take better notes and read a little more.
You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on.
I'm working on it!
Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement.
I was the only one who got a strait A in my class.
Congratulations on your success.
Thank you.
Yes. Please give me your ID card, A photo.
Ok. Here you are.
Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit. The library card is free.
Ok. Here is the money. And If I return the card, Can I get the refund?
Of course, As long as the card is well kept.
Ok. I see. Thank you.
You are welcome.
Nice to see you again, Too. Peter. How's your family?
Very well. How's Mrs. Clinton?
Not bad. But she's as busy as before.
Pretty well. I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not, But I feel good about it.
If you get the promotion, What will your new title be?
If I get the promotion, I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer.
Will you get a pay-raise, Too?
Whenever you are given added responsibilities, You should get a promotion.
That makes sense. Who interviewed you?
My boss.
What kinds of questions did she ask you?
She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be.
The second one sounds rather difficult to answer. What did you tell her?
I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally.
Those are good answers. How did she react?
She told me that even when I become a senior engineer, I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team.
What do you think about her as a boss?
She's pretty easy to get along with. She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally.
You're lucky. Not everyone has such a great boss!
That's true. She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company.
When you find out you get the promotion or not, Let me know.
I will do.
Yeah, About 5 minutes ago.
Who's winning?
The Bulls, Of course!
What! That wasn't a foul! C 'mon, Ref!
Don't worry, Shan always screws up free throws.
You were right! He didn't make the shot!
That was a great shot! A three pointer, Yeah!
Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!
This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, Open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!
Okay... End of the first quarter... Alright, I'm gonna make a beer run.
Not yet. I'm not finished with my research yet.
What research?
Reading my fashion magazines! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends?
But they're just ads...
Duh... That's the point. The people in the ads are wearing what's in. Plus, There are articles on new trends...
Out of sight, Out of mind.
Who do you mean?
Don't you know they have had little affection for each other?
I can't remember.
It's on the tip of my tongue. I think it starts with a 'B'..
Yes. Do you want to go with me?
Ok. ( Several minutes later. ) Let's go into the school auditorium.
Now that take this seat. Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage?
Yes. I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves, All sorts of feelings welling up in my heart.
That's true. Four years 'trails and hardships, Joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together. I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life.
How time flies. Look, The president of the college has come onto the stage.
He's going to make the opening speech.
Thank you. Nice to meet you too. I'm John. Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane.
No, This is the second time. But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Take it easy. It will be OK soon. You see, I take this long-hour plane frequently, But the jet lag still makes me uneasy.
Oh, That's too bad. Do you get a good knowledge of China?
Yes, Whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most.
All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall. And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World.
Was it built before the In dynasty? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty.
No, Before the In dynasty.
Oh, Yeah. Thought I am an American, I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well.
Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health. And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea.
Yes, I have.
Good. So, Which is your top choice?
Medicine. In my country, That certainly has great prestige.
I see. Which subject did you put last then?
Oh. History.
That's interesting. Could you give any reasons for your choice? Can you explainwhy do you put medicine first?
Well, Doctors are such an important job. I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got, Isn't it? I want to be important and help people.
Yes. I suppose so.
You're leaving so soon? I wish you stayed a little longer.
I wish I could stay a little longer, But a lot of things to do back home.
Have you got the ticket?
Yes, I did.
What time are you going?
At 11:00 o'clock.
I'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport.
No, I'll go by myself, Thanks.
Ok, Goodbye.
Yeah! He's very good at showing off his knowledge.
A well-learned person never does that.
Where are they from?
Most of them are from America and Europe.
What are they doing in Beijing?
They are attending an international conference here.
Which hotel are they staying at?
They are staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Surely, I do. It's hard to come by, Isn't it?
Yes, It is.
Can you get it?
You can be assured of it.
Hi! Crenshaw and Hawthorne, At the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.
Sure thing. So, Where are you flying in from?
From China.
Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, If you don't mind me saying so.
It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, Visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.
Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, How old are you?
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?
Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!
Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, And what about yourself?
I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S of A, Although I have some Colombian heritage.
Really? That's great! Do you speak some Spanish?
Uh... Yeah .. of course!
No, I missed it.
How could you miss that?
Someone was in the way.
Yeas, It is.Sewen Jes speaking. How can I help?
Actually, I'm calling to complain about your service. The computer I bought last week is faulty.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Sir. What exactly is problem?
Well, Easily, It doesn't work. It doesn't even start probably.
Oh, Dear! I'll do well I can.
I'm very sorry, Sir. I'll bring you a cloth immediately.
Yes, And hurry up!
I'd like to apologize for my carelessness. May I clean it up for you?
No, I'll do it myself.
Here is my card, Sir. Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you?
I should think so, Too!
I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble.
Yes, And please be more careful in the future!
I will, Sir. I'm really very sorry.
That's OK.
I am so sorry about that. It was just a slip of the tongue.
Just tell the truth. I won't take it personally.
Well... Hum. You are sure you won't lose control of yourself?
Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people. Come on, Just tell me. Don't beat around the bush, Please!
Well. Since you'd like an honest answer, I will tell you the truth.
Alright. What is that you want to tell me?
We'Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation!
What? Are you serious? Oh, My gosh! There will be guys everywhere.
Why? Do you have a robot girlfriend?
Not yet... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones.
So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip?
Yep! And take it with me anywhere! And the music is free!
Let me see it! It's so small!
Why would I do that?
Because men like to cheat.
Some men do, But not me.
I'm watching you.
I'm an open book. Watch me all you want.
If I catch you, You'll be sorry.
You won't catch me, Because I love you. I'm not a cheater.
I will poke your eyes out.
I don't want any other woman.
I will chop your toes off, One by one.
Honey, Please. You're the only woman for me, Forever. I swear it.
Hum, Me too. This winter holiday was especially long. What have you done?
Nothing special. I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school, Visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for. How about yours?
You know, I like traveling. I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself.
I don't really like sci-fi movies because they're always really weird.
I know! I don't get them at all. But wait, Isn't 'Terminator' a sci-fi movie?
Hmm... You're right. Well, I guess 'Terminator' is an exception to the rule.
I like it. It makes the city feel alive. I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans.
I think that there are too many of them. I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising. They should have lower prices instead. Then they would see more.
I see your point, But if companies didn't spend money on advertising, No one would hear about their products. I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying. I don't like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying.
I really hate receiving spam. I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway.
Yes, That annoys me too. With billboards, You can look away, But with broadcasts, You can't avoid them. I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign.
I like that too. I don't like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don't buy a certain product, You're not cool or modern or efficient or something.
That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products. They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty.
I don't think so. Why?
Well, My hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party. Would you like to come?
Sure. Would it be alright if I brought a few friends?
The more, The merrier!
Will there be a lot of people there?
I sure hope so. We've each invited about 10 people.
Who else is going to be there?
I'm inviting my friends from work, You, My sister, And a few friends from school.
I know your sister. She's very nice.
Don't worry. You won't be sitting there by yourself.
What time is it going to start?
Most people are working Friday night, So it's going to start around 9 pm.
Should I bring anything?
We'll have beer and snacks, But if you want to bring a bottle of wine, That'd be great.
I could also bring some music if you want. I've got loads of songs on my new iPod.
That'd be great. I'll see you then!
No, Not really. Why do you ask?
Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost.
You saw a ghost? When?
It was many years ago, When I was a little child. It was the middle of the night, And I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen. I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, When...
So that's where you saw the ghost? In your house? What did it look like? Was it hideous?
It was a big, Green thing that looked like a person. It was in the kitchen, And it slowly moved towards the stairs...
So what did you do?
I hid so that it couldn't see me. Slowly it got closer and closer, Until...
Until what? What happened? Did you see it clearly? Did it attack you?
It moved slowly up the stairs, Step by step, And I could hear its approaching footsteps. When it finally got to the top of the stairs, I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas. He had gone to get a late night snack.
He said that I have been eating too much.
Did he give you any advice?
Yes, He asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat.
Yes, You must put yourself on a diet.
That sounds great. I'm absolutely starving! What kind of food are you in the mood for?
I'd love something spicy. Maybe we could get someSichuan hotpot.
You are a woman after my own heart. I don't know many people who can handle spicy food. Are you sure you are up for hot pot?
Sure. If I could, I would eat hot pot every day!
Ok, You are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food, Aren't you?
Well, Let's stop dragging our feet and find aSichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner!
Let me think about it for a minute. Let's see... Oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue! Give me a second and it'll come to me.
Well...? Have you thought of it yet?
No...
Never mind. There's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street. Have you been there?
That's it! That's the one I was thinking of! I told you I'd remember it!
You really have a big head, Don't you.
Q-Duck? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store?
Yes, Definitely.
They have moved to some other places long time ago.
Wow, This place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China.
Yeah, A lot of changes have happened here.
This street used to have few stores. But now, You can see supermarkets, Shopping malls and department stores everywhere.
Yeah, They are my wife's heaven, But not mine. I always get lost in the supermarket.
Me too! I was lost three times ten years ago. There were no English directions then.
Is that better now?
Yeah, There are many English signs, And wrong spellings as many as them.
Yes, I am new.
Is this your first semester?
I just transferred from another school.
What school did you transfer from?
I came here from PCC.
Do you like it here so far?
I am really enjoying it here so far.
Which is better, Here or PCC?
I think PCC is a lot better than here.
Why didn't you just stay at PCC?
I graduated and now want to get a BA.
What scene?
A kitten being run over by a truck.
But where have you been, Alice? You're over an hour late.
Yes, But I couldn't help it. I was late getting off work for a start, And then I missed the bus. The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam. It was one thing after another.
But why were you getting off work so late? The office close at six, Doesn't it?
Yes, But there's a rush on at the moment, And my boss asked me to do some urgent letters.
But didn't you tell him you had an appointment?
Well, No. I thought I'd finish in about five minutes, And I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes. If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic, I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry.
Well, You're here. And that's the main thing.
Great! This calls for a celebration.
Yes, And I know a few things I'd spend the money on.
Yeah, Me too.
A new car for a start.
I suppose I should choose one from the 'Best Career List', To be a public officer, What do you think?
That sounds like a hot job, Right? But in my opinion, You ought not to choose one career from that so-called list, And you need to take your interests, Values, And skills into account.
It beats me! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing.
You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor, And then make a decision.
Me, Too, I can't stop scratching. They are everywhere! Sneaky little jerks.
Do you have any bug spray?
No, I forgot to buy some.
Then we'll have to put up with it.
We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, They'll get drunk and fall asleep.
That's without a doubt, The best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it!
Run! They are thirsty for more!
I've been having a hard time sleeping lately.
As far as I know, Insomnia is usually caused by stress. Are you stressed at all?
Well, I'm really worried about my grades. I didn't think this course would be so stressful.
You're a good student. I'm sure you can do well. What you need to do is to relax.
You're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time?
Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress.
I don't really have time to learn anything new. I need to spend my time studying!
You need to take some breaks throughout the day. Studying all day isn't very usually effective.
You're right. I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class.
Besides, It's not difficult to learn yoga. In fact, I can teach you a move that's supposed to help you fall asleep! You just have to sit down like this, Bend over and breath in deeply.
That's fantastic. I'm going to go try that out in my room now. Good night!
Good night, Sleep tight ; don't let the bed bugs bite!
Actually, I popped in them last night.
Ok, Let's cut to the chase. What are they like?
Well, They're really beautiful people.
I'll say, She is really stacked, Isn't she?
Yeah, She is a neck-off for sure.
And he looks like a typical jog.
He is a professional football player.
Ah-ha, I thought so.
Anyway, That is not what I meant by beautiful.
What did you mean?
I meant that they're very simple, Easy to talk to.
That's right.
Yeah. I think things are worked out just fine.
Yeah. My whole GPA is screwed up now.
Why? What happened?
Well, I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1. 7.
Ouch. You must be very disappointed.
Well, It's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have.
Why don't youre-take the class next year?
That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. How did you do this semester?
I didn't do that well either. I ended up with a 3. 2 this semester. That drops my total GPA to 3. 45.
My GPA is pretty similar to yours. I have a 3. 1 now because of the stupid econ class.
What was your GPA before this semester?
I was sitting happy with a 3. 4.
Why did it go down so much?
Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class.
What happened to you?
I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time.
You better stop slacking off.
You're right. I'm not going to play games during school anymore.
Well, What do you want to see? I don't think there are many good movies out right now.
Mmmm... I know! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it. What do you think?
Now that's a great plan. It's a date!
It could be. There are floods in this country almost every year, But in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent.
It seems that the climate in this country is changing.
The summers are hotter. The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years. There have also been stronger winds.
I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.
I think you're right. Climate change naturally over time, But I think that human activities are speeding up the change. I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem.
Me too. If we don't do something soon, It might be too late.
I'm almost finished.
How much longer is it going to be?
I'm done now. Do you like it?
I absolutely love it.
You really like it?
Yes, I truly do.
I'm glad you like it.
How much do I owe you?
It's going to be $ 55.
Here you go, Thanks for everything.
Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks.
Just last week.
How was it?
Oh, I loved it. I only visited a couple of cities, You know. But I had a great time.
Well, Tell me. What are they like?
They're nice.
Hey! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns!
No wonder you're such a wacko...
Whatever... Smell! Perfume samples!
Nice. Hey, I like the layout of this page...
You mean, You like the pictures of the beautiful models... Hello?
I know, I know. But you always bat around without doing things useful.
Can't you be more considerate? I need your encouragement.
All right. Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs.
Yeah. I think so. You have to be patient and careful.
So I'd rather walk or run to work.
You must be joking!
It's harmful not only for yourself but for others.
What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking?
Stop producing cigarettes.
But that'll affect the national economy.
That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.
How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet?
Maybe it can take effect.
Not bad. We have had a big meeting today, Remember?
Oh, Yea. I forgot. So how did it go?
Pretty well. I think the boss liked my ideas.
Great, So what happens now?
Well, I have to write the proposal. I'm pretty excited about it.
What happened? We're all expecting you, Hans, Dick, Archie...
I'm so sorry, I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour. I'd have arrived but for that.
I see. Where are you now, Li?
Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge.
It's not far away from home, It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk, Can you walk here?
I've thought of that, But what can I do with my car? If only I had taken a taxi!
That's too bad, But don't worry. We'll put off dinner till one o'clock.
I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting.
It doesn't matter. Bye.
Bye.
I'd like to introduce myself first.
Yes, Please.
My name is Gavin White. I was born and raised in London. After high school, I went to Edinburgh University. I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor's degree there. Now I've come here to get my Master's degree. I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends.
The usual time. Half past two in the afternoon.
What place?
The usual place. In front of the treasure house.
And what should I wear?
Your usual shirt and shoes.
What are you going to wear?
Nothing unusual, I'm afraid.
Sheila, How about that fashionable blue dress?
Good. That's something unusual.
I didn't like it. Not a bit. I couldn't stand the music. Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep.
I noticed that, It was not exciting as I expected, But the music was great. I'm always found Jazz. And that movie had a lot of Jazz.
I know. However, Jazz always annoys me. I really don't enjoy music in a movie.
I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of movie do you like?
Anything with a lot of action, I like thrillers and chillers.
Oh, I see.
Well, I enjoy the popcorn and being with you. You're more important than the movie.
Thanks for the sweet words.
Any time.
We've missed you too. The office just isn't the same without you. How is your new job?
It's great. I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming. However, I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues.
What happened?
Well, Three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person.
Wow, So you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work!
I know. It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet. At our old department, It was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us.
Well, Every department is different. You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch, Right?
What is that?
A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic. You know - a party proper.
I definitely don't want to be that! But, I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well. What should I do?
No, You must stay! I swear it, And the oath shall be kept.
I tell you I must go!
Where?
I have spoken my mind, And can go anywhere now.
I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion.
I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return.
Merry Christmas! Mr Bean.
Will you come to join us at dinner this evening? My family will be happy to see you. And father misses you very much.
Well, I would be glad to, But I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree, And play the piano for his song tonight.
Fine, Thanks. How are you?
Fine. How are your term papers?
Oh my lord. I haven't really started them.
How could it be? They are due two weeks later.
I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days.
Kate, You know, I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more. But I'm so busy! How am I going to work and study? How do you do it? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time?
To be honest with you, Jason, I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job. I'm always two steps behind. I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper. Say! Why don't you talk to your advisor? And let me know!
My advisor?
Yes. I think I'm lucky.
Oh, Jack, You deserve it. You'Ve been working so hard.
Thank you for saying that.
I have no idea. It was completely out of the blue.
Don't build a fire under me. I know the importance of time.
But you are too slow to follow them.
Don't you see I'm trying my best?
He got a scolding.
But you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur, To be your own boss.
I'll do it someday. But it's not the right time now. I have to learn a lot by working as an employee.
It sounds like you've got a perfect plan.
You could say so. I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise.
It can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model.
Yeah, The success stories of that company might be useful for me. And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company.
That's right. You should establish good relationships with them. What else are you planning to do while working for that company?
Well, I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors.
Sounds perfect. I think with all that you have in mind, You'll become a successful businessman. By then, Perhaps, I'll join in as a partner of your company.
What an idiot!
Really? What a shame! I thought she was going to win this one.
Me, Too. I'm sure she'll do better in the next tournament.
What are you reading?
I'm reading about Michael Milliken, The Bond King.
Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something? He got arrested for that, Didn't he?
He got arrested all right.
If I remember, He got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison.
Yup, That's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.
I think the government fined him a small amount, And he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire.
That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail.
I know. And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years.
Sure. A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet. If you think about it, Our space shuttles are UFOs.
I've never thought about it like that before.
I've seen photos of UFOs in America before, But they've all looked doctored up.
Do you think that there's life on other planets?
I think there must be.
Why is that?
I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world. The world is just far too big for that.
Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us?
No, But we're trying to contact them.
I suppose you're right.
I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet, Humankind will not become extinct.
Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day?
There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will, But I don't think it's going to happen any time soon.
Yes, I've been thinking about visiting you. I hope to get some advice from you.
Which country do you want to go to?
My field is electronic engineering. Which country do you think I should go?
Were I in your position, I'd go to America.
Which university should I apply to?
There are many universities for you to choose from. Some famous universities such as Harvard, Yale, The University of Michigan, And Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study, But they are very competitive and expensive. Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper.
Oh, I see. Thank you very much.
You gossip! What's the basis of your opinion?
Someone declared that he saw it.
I don't believe it. Jean is such a kind lady. How could she do this?
Who knows? You can't judge a book by its cover.
Maybe!
Yes, But do you have a prescription with you?
No, I don't.
I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor.
I have a headache. Is there anything I can buy without a prescription?
Then you can buy Aspirin.
I will take the Aspirin then. And have you a small first-aid kit?
Yes, Here this is.
I'll take it too.
Thank you and take care.
Oh, Yes, It is.
Shall I light the stove?
That's a good idea.
Well, What's the climate like in your country?
It's mild, But it's not always pleasant.
Which season do you like best?
I like spring. The days are long and the night are short. The flowers are in bloom. We go on picnics.
I work for Thomas Cook Travel.
Oh, Really? What do you do there?
I'm a guide. I take people on tours to countries in South America, Like Peru.
That sounds interesting!
Yes, It's a great job. I love it. And what do you do?
I'm a student, And I have a part-time job, Too.
Oh? Where do you work?
In a fast-food restaurant.
Which restaurant?
Hamburger Heaven.
You might make a few enemies this way.
If they don't think this is fun, They're not meant to be our friends.
You mean your friends. I think it's cruel.
Yeah. But it's fun. Look at those two ugly old ladies... Or are they men?
Hurry! Get a shot!... Hand it over!
I knew you'd come around...
We planned our wedding for next May.
Why so late? Didn't she want to get married this October?
Yeah, I did. But my fiancee has an important project.
That's really a shame. By the way, Who will be the bridesmaid?
Julie's friend, Mary. And John will be the best man.
Wow! I'm very excited about your ceremony.
Hurry! It is time for me to steal something.
What's your meaning?
I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm.
You are a thief?
No, No. I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now. Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others'vegetables.
You mean it is a still virtual game. Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again, And you take theirs as well, Right?
You got what I meant. Perhaps, What I steal are not vegetables, But loneliness.
Don't be addicted to the game. It's not good for your job.
I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time.
Is this a promise?
Yes, I'm serious this time.
On the contrary, I think he's very serious.
No, Not at all. His examples are really interesting.
So they're easy to remember.
Yeah, How about your maths teacher?
He's an old antique, Very serious.
Bad luck, Anne.
Hey! How about your history teacher?
She's another antique.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures. They will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door, Pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it.
Woo, Your home will beautiful on Christmas.
Sure our thing.
I do wish your christmas and happy new year.
Thanks.
What's on tonight?
I want to see 'Click.'.
Who is in this movie?
I don't know. My friend told me it was a touching movie.
About 3 years, So I came here 2000.
So, Where did you grow up?
Providence, Rhode Island. Do you know it?
I am not sure, Where exactly is it?
Well, Not so far from New York. So what about you? Did you grow up here?
No, I was born in Gaoxiong, I only moved to Taipei after I graduated.
Don't be scared. Bite the bullet and everything will be right again.
Thanks for encouraging me. There are problems cropping up here and there. But I will overcome them one by one.
Pretty busy. I have to pick up a lot of credits this year.
What's your major?
I'm majoring in French literature.
Oh, Don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long.
That's right. We got the assignment last week.
When is it due?
Next Monday.
Remind me never to sign up for that course.
I sure did. You're in luck! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains!
Yes! Somebody up there loves me! I knew it wasn't too late for snow.
It is kind of strange though, To have snow in April, And so much of it.
There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time, Don't you think?
When you put it that way, I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever.
This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken. I can't wait to use my new hoard.
It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right.
It depends on the weather.
The radio says it'll be fine.
That'll be great.
Yes, I am studying in Eastern Asian language department.
What are you major in?
I major in Japanese.
What do you think of the literature course.
Its very helpful. The course has let me into a world of literature. I read so many great literatures.
Yes, Nobody was with her.
Where did you say she was?
In Thailand.
I must say I think that is very odd. Are you absolutely certain it was her?
Yes. Yes, I am sure.
Because I don't want any, Er, Do you understand? But you are quite sure, Are you?
Quite sure. I mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers.
It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences.
I was so angry that I could not keep cool. What I need is just an apology.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Hi, Mary. How are you?
I'm filthy rich! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal?
Yeah, I guess I did. They're going to buy invoking?
That's right. For seventy-five million. So how are you?
I'm getting by OK. I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division.
I haven't made up my mind. Maybe I will go to the US. What about you?
I am going on a hiking trip. It's good exercise as well as fun.
I think so.
So why not come and join us? Lee will come as well.
That's great. I will go hiking with you.
I got my father's goat last night.
What did you do to get his goat?
When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters, He jumped down my throat. So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought.
I guess we should start with nominees first.
Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting.
We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared.
Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members?
Yes, I can do that this afternoon.
Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations. Doesn't that seem logical?
Yes, Let me put it on the calendar.
Couldn't be better.
Yes, But I'm not sure which one to sign up for.
What kind of program are you looking for? Full-time or part-time?
I have to work during the day, So I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings.
What kind of course are you looking for?
I need to improve my English.
Do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class?
I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me, So a group class would be fine.
Have you ever considered taking one of our online courses?
I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better.
That's fine. If you want, You can sign up for a pre-sessional interview.
What's that for?
One of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best.
Do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read?
Sure. Here's a brochure about out English classes that meet in the evenings.
Thanks. I'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course.
I was turned down again. It's frustrating. I guess you'Ve got to teach me some skills.
Me? I'm even less experienced than you are.
At least you know what American women generally like in a man.
Believe it or not, I guess American women like a man in good shape, Which Chinese women may not care about so much. That's my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.
American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, There aren't many chances.
No, That's not true. I'Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese. But those Chinese look very strong and healthy. So if you exercise more often, I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls. How old is Jacky Chan? He's small and short. But I bet he can have any American woman he wants.
You know, That's going to be a tremendous change for me. Because I never exercise.
Why don't you try then? Even if it doesn't help you find an American girl, You could still have a stronger and healthier body. You won't lose anything by doing that.
Open the door. It's me. I can't find the key.
You're always so careless.
Oh, Thank you. I am exhausted. Will you bring me a cup of tea?
Okay, But I haven't prepare supper.
So let's eat out.
What do you want to eat?
Noodles. How about you?
Dumplings.
What's Net Love?
Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love! It's Net Love.
Ridiculous! They haven't met! Maybe they're the same sex!
Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos. He's called 'Beast'?.
How could you know?
I watched the screen display!
Do you know 'He' is Ms. Rebecca!
It's typical Net Love, And a typical lesbians 'homosex! Ha!
Impossible!
How about the cinema?
That's a good idea. We haven't been there for ages.
What would you suggest to see?
Oh, I don't know. It depends.
I'm tired of Mexican food. Besides, You picked the restaurant last week.
Ok, You win. You pick the restaurant this time.
Are you sure?
Can you stay for dinner? We'd love to have you join us.
It's really nice of you. Thanks!
Sorry to hear that.
How about next week?
Fine, We'll be expecting you then.
Yes, I do. I think that science is making us wiser. What do you think?
I don't think you're right there.
I believe industry is making us wealthier.
I don't believe that.
And in my opinion, Medicine is making us healthier.
I agree with you in the sense. But we're all more miserable than ever, Aren't we?
I don't agree with you. I maintain that we're healthier, Wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago.
That's your opinion not mine.
Not too bad. It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date.
I guess so. Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual.
She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating.
Yes, Now many girls want to be independent, So it is a little popular, Especially among white collars.
But I am still traditional, So I felt weird when she paid for herself.
Forget about it!
Are you satisfied with your girlfriend?
It will be a long story. We have many differences, For example, She usually puts all her clothes into washing machine. That is the sort of thing I can not bear.
Yes. After so many years of hard work, I'd rather I had an office of my own.
If you need help, Don't hesitate to ask me.
I'll be very glad if you would help.
I'd like to wish you every success in your new venture.
Thank you. I wish I would.
Good luck to you.
Of course. He is now 50 years old. And he started out studying alembics, Singing, Dancing and martial arts at the age of nine, And has tarred in 140 kung fu films. He has also become an independent producer and director.
You know only one aspect of him. Do you know what he would do in the kitchen?
I have no idea. Tell me.
In the kitchen, With his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show.
What does he do there?
Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward. Picture a man making a stir-fry,Tossing the mixture up in the air, And then catching it, Every last bit, In his work. And his culinary motto is 'Enjoy the moment.' If you want to know hey theycook, Visit www. StudioClassroom. Com. Tw for the recipe.
I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller.
Well, I'm no movie expert, But those special effects were impressive by any standards.
Special effects? Baloney! That movie was made on a shoestring budget. They've been using trick photography like that for years.
Okay. But you have to admit that it was an exciting story, Especially with that surprise ending.
You should read the book. The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end.
Oh, Really? How does the book end?
Read it yourself and find out!
Yes. It is Everest, Also called Zhumulangma in China. It is 8, 844. 43 meters above the sea level.
Wow! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth.
Actually, It is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around. And is has heavy fog for most of the time.
Have people set foot on its peak?
Yes, It has been conquered by many people in history.
I'm most upset to hear that. Are you better now?
Not much better. Thank you.
Come on. Cheer up!
Thanks, Mark. I used to be a member of the school choir.
No wonder you can control your voice so well. You are a professional singer.
Well, You are flattering me. I wouldn't say I am a professional, But I did receive some training at school. My music teacher used to be a professional singer.
Well, A good teacher makes good students.
You are quite right.
Oh, Certainly. When would you like to come?
Well, When will it be convenient for you?
This weekend would be OK with me.
These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line. If they're charging 10 % less than we are, We've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit.
Profits are almost nonexistent now, We can't beat their price. How do they keep their price so low?
We can try to lower our cost of production then. We need a price that we can compete with, Something comparable with the competition.
You really think we can make it? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again. We're no match for them, The competition will beat us hands down.
Are you sure? He doesn't look that old.
He told me so himself.
That means it's developing very fast.
You said it.
Problems are inevitable.
You can't help learning when you're using it all day. You'll see. A few weeks' study in the school will have a similar effect on you.
I hope so. You see, At the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent. I'm awfully worried, I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect.
Oh, She likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class. She doesn't mind your making mistakes, Though.
You know, Speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use.
Yes. Can I?
Do you really need to?
Yes. Is it OK with you?
Is it important?
Yes. Do you mind?
You really have to?
Yes. Will you let me?
I guess so.
I grow a variety of things, So that something is in bloom all year round.
When is your garden at its best?
It looks best in spring, When the plum and cherry blossoms are out.
It was great! How was your year?
It was good. Do you have a girlfriend at school?
Yes, I'm dating someone. Her name is Amanda.
Oh, Thank you. Your skirt looks beautiful, Too.
Sort of yes.
But he is not someone who can be led by the nose.
But I am not that someone. I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do.
Serves you right.
What time do you open this evening?
We open at 6:30, Sir.
I see. I'd like to reserve a table for two.
Yes, Sir. What time would you like your table, Sir?
I'm not sure, Perhaps around 8 pm.
Fine! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm, Sir. May I have your name, Please?
Davis.
Thank you, Mr. Davis.
Oh, Any chance of a table by the window? My wife loves the bird's eye view. As it's her birthday, I want it to be a celebration.
I see. We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything, Please be assured that we'll try our best, Mr. Davis. I hope you'll understand.
I do, But I would appreciate you, If it could be arranged.
We'll try our best.
Thank you.
So no more regret now?
Don't remind me of that. This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game.
Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself. Enjoy your life.
I just can't help it. Oh, Look at Clive, He is really a big hit. They are definitely gonna win.
It's only seven minutes into the game, Too early to cheer up.
Come on, 18 points already, They are never gonna catch up.
Who knows! It's a long game. Look! That was a really nice shot!
Thay are coming back to narrow the gap.
Wait, That guy, I know him. He is just a bench warmer.
A secret weapon. They'd better set up the defense now.
Clive is ready to explode. Keep your eyes open.
Oh, Man! I can't believe it. A slam dunk!
Good that he resembled his old, Quick self.
Wow! She's gorgeous.
Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time. Winters are short, But cold, Wet, And windy. I love the summers in my city, But I hate the wintertime.
Does it ever rain in summer?
We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks, But apart from that, Summers are dry. Thunderstorms make the air fresh again, So most people don't mind then.
What are spring and autumn like?
I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, The weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, Sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny and dry, But it's gradually gets colder as winter arrives. What are the seasons like in you city?
Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, So our summertime is your wintertime, And vice versa. We get some rain in every season, But most is in winter. In winter, It sometimes gets cold, But our winters are usually quite mild. Summers are warm, But not hot. Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each. The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city.
Do you usually go on a summer holiday?
No, I don't. I go on a winter holiday instead. I go somewhere warm.
I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn. I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city.
I think it's mainly from the environment a person lives in.
Don't you think people get their personalities from their parents?
No, But parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in, So they certainly influence their kids 'personalities a lot.
So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents.
Maybe when they become teenagers, They want to be completely different to their parents.
You might be right. I guess most parents want their kids to be like them, But kids today grow up in a different environment. You know, They know much more about the world from the internet, Newspapers, And tv.
Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies?
Maybe some of it. I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren't bringing their child up correctly.
Parents have a difficult job. They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too.
Yes, That's true. Your son is doing well at school, Isn't he?
Yes, He is. He's very hardworking when he's at school. Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner. After dinner, He goes out with his friends.
So, He's not a bookworm? It's good that he has an outgoing personality. Some kids are very quiet and introverted. You wonder they'll survive in the real world without their parents to support them.
Not really. I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year. I hardly know anything about art or sculpture. You are a true art lover, Aren't you?
I love going to art galleries, Particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art.
I never understand the meaning of those painting. They are too abstract for me. I didn't pay much attention in art class at school.
Art isn't for everyone. I'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery. It's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture.
I like sculpture, Especially that form ancient rome or Greece. What time are you thinking of going? I'd love to go with you.
I thought I'd have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards. Does that sound ok to you? Bus 51 goes directly there.
That sounds fine. What time shall we meet at the bus stop?
Let's meet at 12:30. It will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits.
Would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead? I do enjoy cooking.
This is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax.
Cooking makes me feel relaxed. So, What are we cooking?
Ok, Well, We're going to make a pan of lasagne, A salad, And some garlic bread. Here's the recipe. Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard?
Sure. We should probably pre-heat the oven right away, Too.
That's a good idea. Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius?
That's a bit high for lasagne. I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there.
Fine. I'll just get out the casserole dish, The saucepan, The salad bowl, And the baking sheet.
You know, I could do this myself. Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better?
I don't think it's broken.
Well, If it's not broken, Then you need to learn how to vacuum better, Because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages!
Fine. I'll go vacuum. Let me know if you need any other help.
My pleasure. What a pity you have to leave so soon!
We would stay longer. But I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning. Thank you for your warm hospitality.
You're welcome. Maybe next time we'll come to see you.
My wife and I will look forward to it.
I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit. Oh, What's your flight number?
Lt's Flight No. 302, Northwest Orient Airlines.
They just announced the boarding call.
Then we've got to get going.
Ok. Bon voyage and a safe landing.
Thank you again for all your help.
Bye.
One of many abundant resources, I'd like to point out.
I think you'd better apologize.
Oh, But I can't. It wasn't my fault.
Maybe not, But I advice you to say it was your fault.
My father failed in business.
Oh, That's really tough.
Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced.
I can understand. By the way, Is there anyway I can help?
No, Not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.
Oh, That's so great, Bless you! If you need me, I'll always be there.
Thank you.
It's nice to be here.
Would you care for a drink?
Just a club soda for me, Please.
I want to check out these books.
I need your library card.
I have it right here.
It seems you have late fees.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
How much?
Your late fees come to $ 24. 50.
I don't have that right now.
You have to pay it off before you can check out more books.
I'll do that soon.
Fine, How are you doing?
Ok.
What do you want to do?
I'm hungry. I'd like to eat something.
Where do you want to go?
I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant.
What kind of Italian food do you like?
I like spaghetti. Do you like spaghetti?
No, I don't, But I like pizza.
Let's change the subject.
Johnson? I can't place them.
We met them in Bermuda last May.
They've completely slipped my mind.
The couple with the dogs-think back.
No, I don't recall a thing about them.
Well, I've invited them for brunch.
Hmm, I must be getting absent-minded.
Thank you. Here's a present for you.
Oh, You shouldn't. But thank you very much.
Wait a moment, I want to go to the toilet.
You try to put on a brave face.
Thank you.
I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye.
Yes, Goodbye and keep in touch.
Study study study! I want to learn a lot.
You're going to take courses?
Yes, I'm going to take some university courses there.
Sounds hard.
Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.
Won't you get lonely?
Hey, I'm a pretty cool guy ; I'll make friends. And I'll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too. You know, Like fencing or theater or something.
Yes, That's right.
What do you suggest I should see in New York?
Well, How about the Museum of Modern Art?
No, I don't like museums. They're boring.
Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building?
Ah! That sounds interesting.
Yes, Sing a song. But don't sing a sad song.
Most of my songs are sad, Sorry.
Well, Please sing one that's not sad.
Ok, I'll sing San Francisco then.
Yes. Oh, It's you, Linda. I haven't seen you for a long time. Well, Come in and sit down. How about something to drink?
Yes, Please. I'm a little thirsty, Actually.
Would you like tea or coffee?
Coffee, Please.
Here you are.
Would you like to talk over a drink?
That sounds good. How are you doing, Linda?
Just fine. Are you busy now?
No. I'm just killing time.
Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow?
Yes. I haven't been in his house for several weeks. When shall we start?
How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning?
All right. See you tomorrow.
Fantastic! I enjoy clubbing, Especially those clubs with live bands. The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad, Full of smoke, And the music is too loud, So conversations are not really possible. Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette.
How did that happen?
A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it. If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face.
Sounds cool! But that is not what a lady should do. People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk.
She is so pretty sick.
That's too bad. I wish your mother can recover soon.
Thank you.
Does he do that with his Dad? I mean, Does he complain things to his father?
He never does, And in fact, He seldom communicates with him.
But didn't you say that his Dad takes him under his wings?
Yes, I did. He only takes side with him. He seldom asks what Dick is doing.
I don't have the slightest clue.
What school would you like to go to?
I'm not sure.
You honestly have no idea?
PCC is perfectly fine for me.
You might as well stay here.
That's not a bad idea.
PCC is a wonderful institution.
You have a point.
So, What are you going to do?
I'm just going to keep going to PCC.
Hi, Sterling!
What do you think of our new teacher?
Professor Wood? I think he's a brilliant scientist.
You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?
I guess so.
I know, We've met.
I didn't know you knew Frank.
Yes, We met last year at a conference.
No. I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow.
I don't blame you for getting some rest.
Yeah. I need to.
What happened with that guy at the cafe?
Nothing.
But you're crazy about him?
Yes, I am.
Why don't you run off with him? What are you waiting for?
I don't actually know him.
Really?
I only know him through the... You are not gonna believe this.
Oh, Let me guess. Through the internet?
Yes.
Hmm. You'Ve got mail.
I like him very much. He's a gay dog.
Are you ready to welcome him?
I am all set. He can come anytime.
I used to work as a teacher.
How did you like your job?
Oh, If I hadn't moved here I would never thought of changing it.
Thanks to your help. To our friendship.
Bottoms up! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have?
Dancing. The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us.
Oh, How wonderful! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys.
I'll surely make introductions for them.
Yes. I like it very much.
Cooking is a hobby with me. I'm always trying to think up new recipes. I hope you like the soup. It's kind of a specialty of mine, So I hope you enjoy it.
It's excellent.
Thank you for your compliment. Won't you try this fish with white sauce? I'm rather round of it.
It's delicious.
What sort of western food do you like best?
I like beefsteak very much. Have you tried Chinese dishes?
I find the Chinese dishes wonderful.
Well, It's getting late. I have to get up early tomorrow. So I must say good night.
It's still early.
He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities.
Galileo is one of them.
So are Copernicus and many others.
Yeah, I think so. Oh, By the way, I need to ask you something.
What's that?
Could I get back the sweater you borrowed?
Sure. Oh, That reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?
My boots? Er... Sure, Ok.
Yeah, Really.
Is it Ok if I sit here?
Of course. Suit yourself.
Thanks. My name's Bill Peters, By the way.
Hi, I'm Susan Jackson.
Nice to meet you. And what do you do, Susan?
I'm a student at UCLA.
Oh, Are you? And what are you studying?
Medicine.
Really?
Yes, I want to be a doctor one of these days. What about you?
I'm an engineer, I work for Boeing. Say, Would you like a drink?
Sure. Thanks.
Well, I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown.
That's cool. Have you already found an apartment to live in?
I'm planning on living with my parents. Won't you?
I couldn't even if I wanted to. My parents told me that if I went home, Then I'd have to find my own place.
You mean they're kicking you out?
Not really, They just don't want me living at home. My older sister did that, And she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, It got harder and harder for her to move out.
Well, It's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with, But they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so.
My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well, And because of that, They want me to be more independent. They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own.
I know I need to learn that myself, But I just don't have the money for it at the moment. Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place.
Well, Let's get together soon.
Okay. Would you like to have lunch some day next week?
Sure. How about Monday?
Hmm. I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday. I've got to fly to Chicago on business.
Well unfortunately, I'm tied up on Tuesday. I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town, And I don't think there's any way I can get out of it. Are you free on Wednesday?
Wednesday? Let me see. Hmm. Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday. Oh, Yes! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned, And it's essential that I keep it.
Well, I'm afraid Thursday is out for me. I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee, And it's very important for me to be there.
So that leaves Friday. I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday. How about you?
Friday sounds good. Where should we meet?
You know, I really must be going now or I'll be very late. Can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide?
It's Tuesday today. I always go to my class on Tuesday night.
I didn't know you were taking any kind of class. Tell me about it.
Well, I'm learning how to use math in the business environment.
What for?
The job market is so competitive nowadays. I want to develop some useful skills.
I really admire you for that. How is it going?
It's going all right. I'm learning some things for the first time, But I'm also brushing up on some things that I already know.
Which one?
The tallest one.
She isMiao Li. She's come here to see her brother.
Oh, It's so. She looks very lovely. Could you give me some else information on her?
Ok. She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill.
How do you think about her?
She looks very beautiful. She is a nice girl.
I'm wondering if she has boyfriend.
No, She hasn't.
Great! Thank you very much.
I want to get a passport.
You need to apply for a passport.
When can I apply for it?
You can apply right now.
I'd like to do that.
Fill this out, Please.
What's next?
I will need to take your passport picture.
When will my passport be ready?
It will take about three weeks.
That's great. Thank you.
About my boyfriend.
Again!
You are really a wet blanket.
Do we have to type out our homework?
Mr. : No. You only do that when you write reports.
Is there anything else?
Mr. : For those of you who don't have a calculator, Get one.
We are allowed to use a calculator in class?
Mr. : Yes. By the way, Review today's notes this evening. We may have a small quiz tomorrow.
It is beautiful! Look, There are so many birds around it.
It is a great place for a relaxing vacation.
Listen to the sound of nature! It's like music.
Yeah, I agree. It makes you feel really good.
What are those?
Do you mean the red things? They are roses.
I'm going to take more pictures today.
Me, Too.
Well, The stereotype in the movies is that L. A. Is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people. I guess, In the back of my mind, That's what I expected.
And, Is it what you found?
Well, It is and it's not. The city of L. A. Is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected. There are people here from all over the country and all over world, Like New York. I've heard people say that in L. A., Everyone is from somewhere else. Tha's partly true. So, I've met all kinds of people here. What I'm realizing is that the picture of L. A. That's in movies only represents a small segment of the city.
You're right. Life isn't always like the movies.
Morning. Can I help you?
Yes, I'd like to know how to use the library. You know, I'm a new student here.
All you need is your student identification card to check out books.
Yes. Here's my identification.
That's all you need.
Thank you very much. By the way, How many books am I allowed to check out?
You can check out two books at a time. But you can't check out newspapers, Magazines and periodicals, They have to be read within library.
How long can I keep the books?
For two weeks. After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer.
I want a book on physics. Could you show me where I can find it?
Yes, Over there to your left.
Yes, The weather is wonderful, The game is wonderful and the players are wonderful.
I think John is the best player on the field.
He certainly is. He is the Peckham in our collage.
Maybe he shouldn't come to collage, He should become a football star.
Ok, Let's start opening some presents!
Oh look! What a great little bib for the baby! This will definitely come in handy! Oh wow, You also got me a stroller! That's so great! Thank you!
This next one is from Betty.
A highchair and car seat! Wow Betty, Thank you so much! I really appreciate it!
One more from Carla.
A playpen and crib! Thanks Carla! This is just what I needed!
Ok, That's all of them. No more gifts. Now who wants to guess when the baby is due?
Umm. I think my water just broke! Get me to a hospital!
You can check out two books at a time.
How long can I keep the books?
For two weeks. After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer.
Well, I'Ve got some papers due.
Really? So what's the news?
Not too good yet. Better than I was though.
You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall.
I like the sight and the sound. It worked on me like a magic when I was a child.
Your dream will come true. It's really breathtaking.
That is just an excuse. You can always find some time to exercise.
But I work hard all the time for long hours. Often I have no time for lunch. Yet, I am still getting fatter.
Bill, You know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing. And skipping meals will not help you lose weight. In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals.
I know you're right, But what can I do?
How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night?
But I'll miss the news. It's important in my business to keep up with events in China.
I know, I know. Have you got a portable radio? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time.
That's a good idea!
Are you married?
No, I'm still single.
Then, You putS in this blank.
Yes, I nearly didn't sleep last night.
Did you hold a party or something else yesterday?
No, I just watched Supergirl, And it began too late in the night. I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock.
I don't like this program, Because there are too many constant arguments between the judges.
The contestants are different. These girls perform in free styles.
Do you have much time watching TV?
I think less than 3 hours. This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs. Too many ads between the programs. I prefer listening to the radio.
I don't like ads, Either. But ads could bring big profits to the TV station.
If they could make beautiful ads, I could bear.
All right. But how?
Just imagine, If a horse can fly, If a bird can swim... And things like that.
I see. But could you give me another piece of paper?
Ok. Here you are. Anybody who wants help, Please come to me.
Thank you so much, Mr Addison.
So, Please!
Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom. He is putting on grand airs.
I bought you a new one last year. Isn't it handsome?
It is great. But Tom's bike is so much better than mine.
Frankly, He is more well-behaved than you.
Nothing of that sort!
Why hasn't the bus come yet? Every morning we have to wait for so long.
Mom, It's OK. I will buy a big car one day. It is faster than the bus.
Really? I am looking forward to that. What about the traffic?
Let me see. Yes. I will buy a plane for you. There is no traffic up there.
I'm going out this Saturday.
Do you already have a foursome?
Unfortunately, We do. Let's plan for something together for Wednesday. We can go right after work.
That sounds good. Where do you want to play?
We won't have much time, So let's play somewhere close to work.
How about Bellevue? It's pretty close.
How much does it cost over there?
Twilight rates are 21 dollars.
That's pretty good. Let's do it.
Aright. I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4.
Make it 4.
Ok. I'll call you later when I get a tee time.
Sounds good. I'll see you on Wednesday then.
Aright. Have fun on Saturday.
Will do.
Um, Very nice. It's warm in spring and cool in autumn.
Is it hot in summer?
Yes, It is, But not as hot as in Beijing.
He is playing hob with the fact.
Why do you say so?
Because he stayed with me all the time that night.
Not now.
Chicken! You're afraid I'll beat you.
Are you kidding? I just feel tired right now.
But you just got here. Can't you stay a little longer and have some tea?
That's very kind of you. But if I don't go now I'll miss the last bus.
That's too bad.
Thank you for your hospitality.
Thanks for coming.
How about next time we meet at my place? And I'll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise.
Great idea. I'm looking forward to it. See you then.
Well. I really do have to go.
Good night then.
See you tomorrow.
What do you mean?
I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us.
Yes, Look over there. That's the Empire State Building. My book says it's 102 stories tall.
It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned?
You're right, But when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering.
What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue?
Quite a number. Actually every skyscraper has a history. A few blocks ahead we'll see St. Patrick's Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center. It's a landmark.
What's there after that?
Well then, There's a Central Park. Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world.
What are all they for?
Most of them are office buildings, Huge department stores, And hotels but some are just private homes. New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places.
Hi Simon. Nice to meet you again.
I hope you are Settling in at school!
I am! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses.
Good! Me too! By the way. You didn't tell me what you are studying here.
Didn't I? I'm doing business studies.
Really? That's great. You hope to join a company after graduating?
Maybe. My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born. We are living in Toronto. Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate. It's too soon to say really.
What about your friend Zoe.
She's from Australia. She lives in Sydney. Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy.
Accountancy? Really? She must be very good at figures.
I guess so. What about you, Simon?
I'm studying law.
Great! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer.
Sure, Welcome anytime.
More than one. I think the count is now three, If I remember correctly.
Wow. I'm getting rushed too, But just one. Are you thinking of joining any of them?
I don't know. I know there are advantages to joining, But I'm not much into group stuff.
The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group.
I think I'm going to decline. I just prefer to do my own thing.
Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school?
My dad was, But not my mom.
Yes, I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department.
What are you majoring in?
I'm majoring in English.
Is it difficult to learn?
Yes. The language is hard to learn, But it's interesting.
Do you know anything about Britain and America?
I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture.
Right. It's important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well.
You're right.
I'm fine thanks. How about you?
I'm okay. What are you doing these days?
Not a lot, Actually. Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia. I may have to go to KL in a few weeks.
That's great. When are you starting?
Probably in a week or two. I'll let you know.
What do you mean by cautious?
She never puts words into her mouth, She only repeats the opinions of others.
Thats a clever way to escape responsibility.
You are kidding! He just broke up with Ann.
Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann. She is like a breath of fresh air.
I hope I will meet her soon.
You're kidding. We'll never make it across in one piece! Let's cross at the light.
Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street.
If you want to cross here, Be my guest. I don't feel like dodging cars and scooters!
Yes, Of course. This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines.
I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Thank you for the invitation.
It's my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?
Yes, Please. Thank you for everything.
No, But we still stay in touch.
What's the way you keep in contact?
We contact through email.
Email is not always the best form. I think QQ is way better.
Your words sound a bit reasonable. But don't forget the time difference.
You're right.
It's so faraway.
I saw Emily yesterday evening. She was wearing a CD evening gown. She told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120!
$ 120?! Then I should go and see what I can get...
No, Thank you. I had too much to drink yesterday evening. I had a bad hangover this morning. My head felt terrible.
Were you celebrating something?
Yes. It was a friend's birthday party. We drank all kinds of things-beer, Wine and spirits. After midnight, We were even drinking cocktails!
It's a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks. You should stick with one for the whole evening.
I know, But it was a celebration, You Kwon? I don't think I'Ve see you drunk.
I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints.
You are a sensible drinker. Anyway, I'm not going to drink any alcohol this evening. I don't 'want another bad hangover.
Let me buy you a soft drink then. How about a coke?
Yeah. That's a good idea. I heard that coke was first used as a medicine.
Rally?... Barman!... A large coke with ice and lemon, Please... Thanks. Here's the money.
Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow?
Yes. I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine...
... And taste a few! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not.
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.
Yes, I do. I'll walk you there.
Thanks!
Are you applying to study or work abroad?
I want to study abroad.
What do you want to study?
I hope to study English literature.
Have you got your visa yet?
Not yet. I have an interview with the visa official today.
I see. Is it your first interview?
No, I've already been to here for three interviews.
What happened?
I was denied a visa?
Why?
Like most students. I want to work in America after graduation.
I see. Well, Good luck!
I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down.
As obnoxious as Bean is, We should still try to finish this case.
True-well, Do you have any forwards for me to send him?
Yeah! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth?
Well, She's tall and pretty.
Is she like you?
I suppose so. We're both friendly and easy-going.
Is she as clever as you?
No, She's not as clever as me.
Big head!
On 20th May 1963.
Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar?
27th day of the fourth month.
By the way, Could you tell me when the film will begin?
It will begin at five thirty.
I am frigid I can't be there on time.
You can see it tomorrow.
I don't want to miss it today.
See you.
See you.
Sure! Are you okay? You seem a bit worried. What's on your mind?
We need to talk.
Okay...
I'Ve been thinking, And well, I think we need to start seeing other people.
What? Why? I mean, We'Ve had our ups and downs, And we have the occasional disagreement, But we're happy together, Aren't we?
That's just it, I'm not happy anymore, Tim. It's not you, It's me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, And you are a great guy! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for!
So, What are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?
Tim, You are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need, But that would be a lie. I know I'd only hurt you, I know I'd only make you cry.
Baby, Come on. Don't do this to me! Whatever it is, We can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, But we gotta stick together! Don't leave me.
I can't, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you. I don't really wanna go but, Deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.
Laura...
Here are your keys. I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week. I'm sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, And I hope that one day we can meet again. I'll always love you. Goodbye.
No. What?
He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail.
No. Really, What happened?
Well, It was all a big mistake, Actually. He got home on Friday night really late, And apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients, So he was really drunk.
Was he out with the guys from the bank?
Yes, I think so.
Oh, Yeah, They always get really drunk.
Well, Anyway, He'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys, So he couldn't get in. He lives alone, You know.
Oh, Really. I thought he lived with his wife.
No, She left him last year.
Oh, Really? Do you know why?
Hang on, Let me finish telling you what happened. Where was I?
He lost his wallet and keys.
Oh yes, Well, He tried to climb in through the bathroom window, But apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot. The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress, So they called the police.
Oh, No.
Yes. So when the cops arrived, They didn't believe his story.
So then what happened?
Well, When he sobered up, He called someone from work to come and bail him out.
Well, That's a bit of a tricky situation.
Yes, I know.
To be honest, I wouldn't.
Why? Do you have to make a choice now?
Not really. But it has puzzled me for a long time.
What's the puzzle?
My husband and I prefer to have no kids, But my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids.
Oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way.
Yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night.
Oh, Really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.
But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not.
Definitely.
You know, I often overhear our neighbor, The young couple, Fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness.
Don't worry. I think in most cases, Children are the glue that keeps a family together.
I guess you're right. But I still prefer to have no child.
Sure. You can fully enjoy your time together.
We're going to that new restaurant for lunch. Would you like to join us?
Yes, I'Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD. I adore him. He's my idol.
How come you don't have all of his films on DVD?
Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays, Especially the ones where he only played a bit part.
I see. I'm sure you'll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.
Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday.
Are you a member of his fan club?
I was, But then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, So I'm not a member now.
Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month?
Of course! I bought two copies.
Two copies? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of, Right?
Oh, It was great. We had seafood buffet. They do one every Friday. The waiters and waitresses are very good. They are very attentive, But don't hang around the table.
I like the buffets they have, But if often order a la carte, Because I don't feel extremely hungry. I like the wine list there too.
Yes, So do I. They have wines from all over the world. There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket. We ordered some Australian red wine, Which tasted delicious and wasn't expensive.
Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage, But the don't do that at “ ginger's ”. What was included in the seafood buffet?
They had almost every kind of seafood. There were oyster, Shrimp, Prawns, Crabs, And fish. I ate a lot of smoked salmon.
Did they have lobster?
No, They didn't. You could order it from the menu. I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet.
Yes, It probably is. I don't like ordering oysters in restaurants. You never know whether they are fresh.
I know. I didn't eat any, But a few people in our group did and no one got sick.
When you eat out, Do you usually eat from the buffet?
Not usually. I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I'm still hungry afterwards.
Oh, You don't usually have a starter?
No, I might have a soup if it's a cold winter day.
No, Not really.
Why is that? It is called real art.
Well, It's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language. That kind of gets on my nerves.
Yeah, That makes sense.
Um, Okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy.
Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, So shiny! I am going to work my magic on your hair! You hear me? You are going to look like a million bucks!
Okay. Um... Can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top.
Don't you worry, I'll take care of everything! Oh my god! I just love your curly hair! It's so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!
Um... No.
Okay, But you are going to be my masterpiece!
Yeah. That's just what is troubling John.
Poor John! He is bothering both sides of this bread.
This situation isn't easy to handle.
I love this store. The only problem is that it's extremely expensive.
Don't worry. I'Ve decided that for your birthday I'm going to take you shopping for a new dress.
Really? I thought you hated shopping?
I do, That's why you should appreciate this gift!
Sure. That's really nice of you. Let's go in and try some things on.
How about this red dress? I think it would really suit you.
That's gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8?
Here you go. On any other day, It would cost me a fortune, But it's on special offer today.
I think this color isn't quite right for me. Do they have the same dress in white?
Let me look. Let's see... They'Ve got one in blue, Green, Pink, Black... And white. Here you are.
This is perfect! What do you think?
I think you look fantastic. Happy Birthday!
I'm so lucky. You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon! Thanks honey!
Haven't you heard? Richard was fired by our manager.
You're kidding. It can't be true.
Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company.
Really? I'm surprised.
Me too.
It could be. There are floods in this country almost every year, But in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent.
It seems that the climate in this country is changing.
The summers are hotter. The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years. There have also been stronger winds.
I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.
I think you're right. Climate change naturally over time, But I think that human activities are speeding up the change. I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem.
Me too. If we don't do something soon, It might be too late.
Yes, Unbelievably cheap. Carlsborg is less than $ 1.
Why do you drink? I mean, Where does drinking get you?
It's fashionable.
Come on, You don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity.
Mary, It's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun.
How? By drinking?
Drinking is just part of it. I mean, You have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, The more you talk. It makes me so relaxed.
When did you begin to drink?
It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting andsipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said 'can I buy you a drink? '..
And then?
Then I talked to her and got her number. You know what? When you don't know what to say? Just drink.
So you get drunk every day?
Fishing. It's great fun.
Is it? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings.
No wonder you always look so active.
Can't complain. What about you?
Not bad. Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband?
I've heard. She looks quite depressed.
Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.
I heard they were just married for 5 months.
Yes, She said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things.
Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden.
You said it. You know, They fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.
Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.
Yeah. We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners.
Definitely. That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce.
We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners.
That's true. Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon.
Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end.
Admit it. You just think of Mussolini.
No, I'm an art lover, So I think more of Bellini and Botticelli!
Ah, Yes. The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body.
Don't we all... Hey! Your cousin sells gift items?
Yeah-all from Italy. See all the saints? They're important to Roman Catholics.
It's okay.
Next time, It's on me.
Don't be silly.
I'm serious.
Alright. Next time, We can try some other flavors.
Certainly. The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good. It must be very delicious.
Definitely. I really like Italian food.
Why, Jerry? Your words just came out of the blue.
You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school.
I work very hard and that's it, You know, Practice makes perfect.
Isn't there anything else?
I have no idea.
You must have a high IQ score.
Well, Jerry, Let me tell you a secret.
Go ahead.
My IQ score is slightly above average.
Seriously? But you are such a genius.
Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure.
Well, Perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ.
You can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, You can also get high marks.
Ok, Thank you. I'm going to the library, Are you coming?
Let's go!
I couldn't agree with you more.
You know all about coffee. I need your advice, So I won't look stupid when I order.
Order tea. Isn't that what you like to drink?
Come on, Hugh! Tea is for wimps! Please, I need your help.
If you want to be macho, Order a double shot of espresso.
Now you're talking. That sounds good. What is it?
He was 20 years old then.
How old is he now?
He's over sixty.
Yes. Why?
Nothing. I'm just asking.
Just asking? But why is your face burning like mad? Ah-huh, Someone has a crush on Jenny, Doesn't he?
Who has a crush?!.
Come on, Ted, Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.
Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out.
What're you so afraid of? Just tell her what you're feeling about her.
I'd totally die if she turned me down.
But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You've got to let her know. Come on! You've got to take a chance! Even though you are rejected, It's not the end of the world! There's nothing to lose, Is there?
I don't know... Well, Maybe, You're right, But how am I going to tell her?
Yes, It's much better than yesterday.
They say we're going to get some rain later.
Oh, Let's just hope it stays warm.
I'll take one. How's the cooler situation?
It's still stocked, And there's plenty of ice. Here you are-cheers!
Cheers. You guys didn't drive, Did you?
No, We walked. Why, Do you need us to carry some stuff home later?
No, It's just that it's a holiday. With everyone out partying, There's a lot of drunk driving.
My pleasure. ( It was my pleasure. )..
I'd love to. Thanks.
When will you be convenient?
Any time will suit me.
Are you doing anything tomorrow?
I'm free tomorrow.
I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock, Will it do?
All right, See you then.
I don't mind. Go ahead.
I'll give it back to you in a couple of days.
Ok. You can keep it as long as you need.
I am not sure. What are you doing?
I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach.
That sounds like a great idea!
Would you be interested in joining me?
Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving?
I thought that we could leave around 8.
That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara?
That was part of my plan.
Well then, I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks for asking me to go with you.
Thank you. I was lucky this time.
I think luck played a very small part in your victory. It is solely due to your hard work and efforts. That brings honor to you and joy to us.
I am flattered.
It is real word.
Thank you very much.
Of course Mike. Who else? We fell in love at first sight.
When's the wedding going to be?
We haven't decided yet. There are a lot of things to sort out, You know.
Are you having a big wedding?
Yes, I've always dream of having a big wedding.
But what do you say about that?
I don't really enjoy big occasions, But I think I'll come round to the idea in the end, It only happens once in a lifetime.
Perhaps I'll agree with Mike. I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before.
No, It's my sister.
How old is she?
She's 18.
She is tall?
Yes, She is.
And she is thin, Isn't she?
Well, Just a little thin.
Pretty good, Thanks. And you?
What's the main idea in this essay?
The United Nations should have more authority.
Hi, Sterling!
What do you think of our new teacher?
Professor Wood? I think he's a brilliant scientist.
You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?
I guess so.
Yeah. Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian. She's almost driving Li Na crazy.
If I were Li Na, I would ask her if she had done that.
She a as meek as a lamb. She never goes against anyone or anything. She's as good as gold, You know?
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary. There is a storm system moving through the East Coast. It will be drizzling all day today, And there's a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve.
That's pretty chilly for the summer! Will it rain on Saturday?
Unfortunately, Yes. It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of theSout.
That certainly sounds like adreary Saturday.
It gets better on Sunday, Though. The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night. It will still be rather cool, With highs in the low 50s. The West Coast will be experiencing some.
I am 24.
What is your date of birth?
I was born on April 15, 1986.
A Korean film called Friends, Starring Sang Dong-gun.
Really? I've seen that movie, Too.
How did you like the movie?
I thought it was pretty good.
Really? I can't say I agree.
You're kidding. The story and acting were outstanding.
I guess I expected too much from the movie, So I was a bit disappointed.
I guess it could happen.
Here you go. I made up the burger patties for you.
Thanks. Smell the hickory chips? They give the meat a nice, Smoky flavor.
I'll take over for a while to give you a break.
Sorry. This is a one-man job. I've got the grill just how I like it, And I've made up my own special sauce.
Then I'll tell folks the food's ready. Come and get it! I've always wanted to say that!
Don't dress like that. You'll make fool yourself. You look stupid in that robe.
What? But it is my favorite piece of clothing.
Maybe it is. But it's out of fashion.
What am I going to do?
Let's go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you.
Of course not, Go ahead.
Maybe you should try to quit smoking. You know it is very bad for your health.
Well, Sure it is. Actually, I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago. I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day. Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day.
You have made a big progress. Quitting smoking is not an easy job. But it will be rewarding in the long run.
Thank you for your suggestion.
You're welcome.
Swimming. What about you?
Indoors activities, Such as chess and gymnastics.
Really? Why?
Mr. Black has been getting a little on the side.
Really? I am surprised. He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife, Does he?
No, He doesn't. Anyway, His wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time.
Well, I am really surprised. By the way, Have you done anything behind my back?
No. The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up.
I like that joke, But I hope it's true.
You don't like the dog? I promise I will never bring it with me!
I heard that too. She must be making a pocket. Well, Good for her.
Now, She'll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states.
Yes, She will. At the moment, The exchange rate is very favorable, So she should try to go as soon as possible, While it's cheaper.
You're right. By the way, Did you hear that tom inherited some money recently?
Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago.
They did. He inherited the money form an uncle. I hope he doesn't lose a lot of it in taxed to the government.
Dying can be very expensive nowadays! What's he going to do with it?
He said that he would probably invest most of it. He's got a well-paid job, So he doesn't need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires.
I had some good financial news yesterday too.
Really? Have you won a fortune in the lottery?
No, But I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I'Ve put in recently. I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way.
It certainly was! So, What are you going to do with your windfall?
No, We're not. We've been drifting apart for a while.
But you two used to do everything together. I thought you really enjoyed each other's company.
We did, But since she started her new job, All she does is hang out with her new friends from work.
Can't you hang out with them, Too?
I could, But all they ever talk about is work, So I always end up feeling left out.
Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, So it's just the two of you.
I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her.
It can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you.
You're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore.
She's probably just excited about her new job. You should give her some time. It would be a shame to lose such a good friend.
I've given her enough time. I'm over it now.
I still think you two should try to patch things up.
I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways.
I'm very fond of you.
Yes, But do you love me?
Why? You mean a lot to me.
Why didn't you answer my question?
What question?
Do you love me? Come on, I'm eager to hear.
You know that I care for you. I .. I'm proud of you.
Don't cherish your words, Dear.
I .. I don't feel like saying it.
Many thanks for your present. I'm so glad you are able to come.
I need to make some copies.
The copier is right over there.
Does it cost to use it?
We do charge to use the machine.
How much does it cost?
We charge ten cents a copy.
How many copies am I allowed to make?
There is no limit to how many copies you can make.
Would you mind showing me how to use it?
Please read the instructions on the copier.
Oh, Okay. Thanks.
My friend and I was argued with each other. For this, I'm very sad. Because I don't want to lose this friend.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I know how you feel. Please don't be sad.
Thank you, But I really want to relax myself. I'm very sorry.
Ok. Don't let it get to you. Goodbye.
Yes, It has been a long time!
How long has it been since we last saw each other?
I think that we last saw each other two years ago.
What have you been doing for the past two years?
I have been going to graduate school at USC.
What are you majoring in?
I am studying international communications.
You should easily be able to find a job with that major.
I am counting on being able to get a good job.
I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.
What happened?
My watch stopped and I didn't know. I certainly need to buy a better one.
There's no need to apologize.
But I ruined your rug.
Forget it. It was an accident.
Mine was ok, Except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.
That's both fortunate and unfortunate. It's the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, A Pole, A Scottish, Two French, An American, A Brazilian, A Chilean, A New Zealander, Though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, We also have a Moroccan, Atogolese, A Pakistani, And two Indonesians!
That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, Except me. There are a few South Koreans, Several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, And one Russian.
Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.
I guess so, But I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, Especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.
Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.
I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.
Well, There is that, Yes.
What kind of business do you do?
We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties.
What kind of clients do you prefer?
Smaller local companies. We specialize in trade & shipping industry.
I used to work for a shipping company for six years, And I am quite familiar with some managers. Would your like to meet them?
Anne! I haven't seen you for ages. How've you been?
Fine, Just fine. And you?
Not bad. It really is great to see you again. W here have you been?
Guangzhou. I've got a cousin there.
Maybe he is trying to find a job. When he finds one, Everything will be settled.
I hope so.
Would you please be quiet, Ladies and Gentlemen?
Well, My speech isn't very long. Would you please...
Quiet everybody!
Yes. May I help you?
May I introduce myself?
Yes.
I'm a new student in the school. My name's John.
Nice to meet you, John.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Green.
Yes, But I didn't really like the third one at all.
That's the Return of the King, Right?
Yeah. Even though the customs were brilliant, I didn't think it was as good as the first two. What did you think?
I thought the special effects were amazing, But I got a bit confused. The plot was too complicated for me.
Did you read the books before you watched the movies?
No. Did you?
Yes, I've read them many times. I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters.
Yes, Trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me.
I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home.
Most movies are. Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles.
That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries.
I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars.
Actually, They not only had 11 nominations, But they won 11 Oscars, Too!
I like it. But how did you know about my new job? I wanted to surprise you.
I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town. You can still fill me in on tile details.
Well, Two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue.
Sure, I think I know the place.
Well, Anyway, I made a beeline over to their office, Had an interview with the manager, And was told to start work the next day.
That's really great, Jill. So, What do you do there exactly?
Right now I'm basically just a secretary, But if I'm given the chance, I want to become a travel agent there.
Don't tell me your're already bucking for a promotion.
No, Of course not. I'Ve got a lot to learn yet. In the meantime, I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone's toes.
Well I wish you luck.
I got rid of that clunker. This is my new one.
Is that right? This sure beats the old one?
Hop in, I'll give you a ride.
Ok. Boy, This looks expensive.
Yeah, It costed a bundle, Alright?
Wow, This thing can haul.
Yeah, This sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned.
I believe it. Hoo, This car corners like it's on rails.
We are on the high way. Find the pound shade...
Wow, This car can really burn rubber.
It's a great feeling.
You made a perfect choice, Jack.
Thanks, Daisy.
What happened?
I'm in the market for a job! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for. I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write. I'Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally. And you know I can be charming in interviews. Goodbye my penniless days! Hello salary and a career!
Ben, We're fifteen. What kind of job are you looking for?
Oh, Just for a position as a gas station attendant. You know, Starting at a simple lowly job, Just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.
Uh-huh.
But I'm just in it for the money, Right? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies? Besides, I love the smell of gasoline, Don't you?
Hello, Helen, Have you heard the news? There's been a horrible accident.
Oh, No! What happened?
Hilda Harris husband, Henry had an accident on his way home from work.
How awful! Was he hurt?
Yes. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
How did it happen?
His car was hit by an express train. It happened at the crossing just behind his house.
How horrible!
He's having an operation in the hospital now. Poor Hilda! You can imagine how unhappy she is.
I hope he'll be all right.
I hope so, Too.
After all, He is a baby.
Yeah. Anyway he is driving me mad.
Well, Everybody wants the bottom bunk. Why don't we flip a coin for it?
Alright. Do you have a coin?
Yes. Here's a quarter. I flip it, You call it in the air.
Heads.
Sorry, It's tails. You lose.
Oh, Well. So you get the bottom bunk. What about our stereos? It looks like we both brought our stereos. Probably we only have room for one.
Your stereo is better than mine. Do you mind if we use yours?
No, I don't mind. I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room.
Probably we can put one on that counter. And we can put one on the floor by the bed. Over there.
Alright. That's a good plan. What about the desks? We have two desks, One by the window and one by the door? Which one do you want?
Well, The desk by the window is nicer, Of course. Don't you think?
Yes, I agree.
So since I got the bottom bunk, Why don't you get the desk by the window? That would be more fair.
Alright.
I mean, We could flip a coin for it, But I would probably win again. I'm incredibly lucky you know. Especially with girls.
Is that right?
Yes, That's right.
Well, I hope you let me hang out with you then. Maybe I can learn from you.
Oh, Certainly. Certainly. I'm always willing to help beginners. Just call me Big Brother Dave.
Are all lucky people so stuck up?
C'mon, Don't take it seriously! I'm just kidding.
Anyway, I get the desk by the window, You get the bottom bunk. That's it.
Why don't we start unpacking these boxes?
I will go get something to eat. You unpack first. Then, When I come back, I'll unpack.
Alright. See you later.
But, We just finished eating lunch.
I know, But I'm really hot.
I'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming.
I've been through a lot today. I forgot to set my alarm clock last night, So I woke up late this morning. And what is worse, I missed the school bus.
That's enough. Sit down.
I'm afraid I can't agree with you.
Why?
Simply because it's not practical at all.
Can't bear it, Right? I've been there before. I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages, Like there is something missing.
Yeah, That's right. If no one sends me text messages, I'll go crazy.
Actually, This is a kind of addiction called 'infomania' or'information overload'..
Addiction? Checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? No way!
Yes, It is. Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day?
Absolutely.
Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time?
Yeah, It's a must. Otherwise, I may miss important phone calls and text messages.
Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer?
Yes. MsN, QQ, Skype, Google Talk, Ali wangwang, Everything, So that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives.
Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information.
It depends.
Do you like coffee?
Um. It's delicious.
And do you like English food?
Not all of it.
Yeah, I'd better head for home.
Dad, I lost mum's necklace. I'm afraid she will scold me.
Don't worry. I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one.
It is so kind of you, Dad.
Pardon?
What time is it, Please?
It's 9:30.
Well you should have picked, In the end you always complain about everything.
Not everything, Just this film. Even the title is ridiculous, And it's so long, Those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.
I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, But you're always so negative.
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.
You see, That's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.
Next time, Go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.
Well he's more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories.
Love stories? More like one-night-stands.
Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, Drunk friends of yours, They're no saints.
My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?
You're unbearable, You can walk home, I'm leaving.
Ok. Where should we go?
Why don't we down to the pool? It's not too far from here.
Fine. I'll be ready in a minute.
Why not? China is a wonderful country.
Will you go with me, Too?
No, I'm afraid not now. I'm too busy.
Yes.
Mr. : I'm Mr. Rogers, Your homeroom teacher.
Where should I sit?
Mr. : Why don't you sit behind Brad?
Who's Brad?
Mr. : He's that guy in the blue shirt.
When does the first period begin, By the way?
Mr. : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement.
Thank you. Wow, Your school has so many honors. Congratulations!
Thank you.
Excuse me. I wonder see Dean Mr. Lee first. I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is?
Certainly. Mr. Lee's office building at the south end of the campus, Just beside the library.
Excuse me?
Let me show you the way. Please follow me.
Thank you very much. It's very kind of you.
My pleasure.
This is it?
It's up on the second floor. You have to use the stairs. The elevator isn't working.
I'm Amy. How do you do?
I'm very glad to meet you. May I have this dance with you?
Certainly! I suppose you dance often.
No, I don't often dance. Isn't this a wonderful party?
Yes, I'm glad I have come.
How do you like fox-trot?
I like it very much.
You dance beautifully.
Thank you. It's lucky that I have got a good partner.
Thank you.
Sure. Let's go. What are you going to have done?
I want to have a foot massage and haircut.
A foot massage sounds like a great idea. They are very relaxing. I'd also like to have a mudpack on my face. It's supposed to help with your complexion.
Good idea. We should also pedicures and manicures.
This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour!
I think it's a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally. Don't you agree?
Oh, I agree. We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress.
Maybe we should try a thai massage too.
What's special about a thai massage?
That's when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet.
Sounds painful!
Thanks.
Where did you have it done?
My sister did it. When did you get yours cut?
Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.
Well, It looks very nice.
Thanks.
I'm feeling a little under the weather.
No, He hasmended his way. After his father died, He set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order.
Really? He is so competent now.
You can't imagine what he is like now.
That's fate.
I feel sorry for her.
Maybe this is God's will.
All kinds, But mostly Pop, Rock and classical. Why?
I have tickets to a show. Do you want to go with me?
What kind of music is it?
Pop. It's Maria Carey.
When is it?
At 8PM tomorrow night.
Yeah, I'd like to go. Do you think we should have dinner first?
Yes, That's a good idea.
Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment.
Oh, I think I know the place you mean. We ate there last month, Right?
Yes, That's right. You have a good memory.
Chips, Finger foods,Desserts, Baked beans. Where're the pork and beef strips?
Yi-jun, We're in the States. Here it's all burgers, Steaks, And dogs.
Ah... Hence the buns and condiments we bought. And this is Holly's potato salad.
You can put stuff on the picnic table. Back to work. The grill is calling me...
Let me know if I can help.
No, Most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official.
Don't you think these festivals are more interesting!
What an idea!
Heineken and Budweiser. We have a two-for-one happy hour special.
Cool, Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.
Okay... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six! And what about some appetizers?
Sure! Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.
Okay. That'll be 80 bucks.
Wait... What!
Well, He's really lucky. It seems that he could win the bet at every turn.
But I don't envy those who are filthy with dough. That's not the whole life.
I know what you mean. I'm not only after bucks. There's something more in life.
Yeah? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean?
You got it! I have a new job, I'm living in a new city, With new friends! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.
So what are you going to do? Take up an art class or something?
Well, First of all, I'Ve decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, It's just that I'Ve been smoking since I was sixteen, And I think it's time to stop.
I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing?
One last thing, I'Ve decided to come out of the closet.
It's about time!
You moved to a new place?
Yes, I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats. Right now, It looks like a home. I would like to have a small celebration party. Please do come.
Thank you for inviting me. Sounds lovely! I would like to come. Where is your new apartment?
It is in the DX community, Room 306, No. 2 building. It is very easy to find. Just ask the guard at the entrance.
Who else will come?
I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor, Paul. He is a very good person. You should meet him.
Ok, I will be there around 6. Is that ok for you?
Yes, Great. I am happy you are coming.
Oh, I'm sorry. It completely slipped my mind.
That's ok. If you could just bring it in tomorrow, I would appreciate it.
Definitely, I'm really sorry.
Chicken!
Sure, What time?
Eight o'clock tomorrow evening.
For how many people?
Ten.
Western food or Chinese food?
Chinese food.
Do you want an expensive meal?
No, Not too lavish.
How much would you like to spend for each person?
What is the usual thing here?
Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate.
Let's say sixty Yuan then.
Ok. Is there anything special you'd like to have on the menu?
We'd like to have typical Chinese food.
Anything you'd rather not have?
No snakes, Please.
How about drinks?
Mao Tai and Qingdao Beer.
Well. Dinner for ten at sixty Yuan a plate, Drink's extra, At 8 o'clock tomorrow evening. Is that all right?
Right, Thanks.
My pleasure, See you tomorrow evening.
See you then.
I'm sorry, But I've got an important job to do.
Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences. I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature.
Really?
You bet. You should try it yourself.
It was exciting!
What do you mean?
Roman is living in Rome, Of course. And go to work by car, Or bus, Or on foot.
I think the Romans do what everyone else does.
Certainly.
And Roman really loves life. He knows how to enjoy himself.
Not always. But they like good meal.
Really?
How can I go there to have a taste?
By air of course.
Yes, Why?
Nothing. I'm just asking.
Just asking? But why is your face burning like mad? Aha, Someone has a crush on Anny, Doesn't he?
Who has a crush?
Come on, Josh, Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.
I'd totally die if she turned me down.
You've got to let her know. Come on! You've got to take a chance!
It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months.
How in the world did you get a copy? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn.
I checked it out of the rental library. It only costs five cents a day.
Is it really worth paying for?
I can't tell yet. I haven't got beyond the first chapter.
If it's any good, I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition.
You mean like a breast enlargement? I don't think that's really necessary. That's not the way a woman should stay attractive.
Why not? Why can't we go back to the way things were?
Because... I don't know. But, Connie, You wouldn't do that, Would you?
Darned right I would!
Maybe make-up would be enough?
Come on, Liz. Be open-minded! Look at my eyes, They are puffy. And my eye bags, They are dark and loose and full of lines and circles. I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings.
But what would other people think?
I don't care what other people think. I am ready for a lift.
I hope so, Too. Rose and her husband have been wanting a boy so much.
After three baby girls in a row, Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws. They want a boy in the worst way now.
But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys.
I agree with you, But you know how old-fashioned the elders are.
Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday!
I hate this part of school.
Why did you put it off until the last minute?
I didn't mean to. Things just kept taking up all of my time.
Maybe you got your plate too full this semester? You can change that next semester.
I think I'd better. I have twenty four credits this time around. That might be a bit much.
I'll say. The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself.
Do you really enjoy such dangerous sports?
Yes, They are great fun and very challenging, Too. Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing, Too.
You are a real fan of extreme sports.
Yes. I love facing danger and overcoming it. It has become part of my life.
I want to think about it for some time.
Please, Honey, I have made proposals to you fifteen times.
I know. But your way doesn't touch my heart.
Oh, God, Please tell me how.
I can't tell you.
Ok, I want you to be happy when we are together, And when you are sad, I would always stay with you.
When I am angry and want to beat someone, You stand there and let me do what I want. Would you?
Yes, I would. Thanks for being in my life.
Don't be so happy, It is just one of my tests!
So does my father. I'm already used to it.
But I can't bear it, John.
How dare you say that? What they do is just for our good.
Yeah, But he really puts blame on me.
Nothing really.
Let's watch a movie or something.
What's on these days?
I think they're playing Lord of the Rings.
That sounds pretty good. Let's watch that.
Where should we meet?
How about at the subway entrance.
Aright. I'll meet you there at one o'clock.
I'd be glad to. I love picnicking.
Then, Put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages.
Can I bring my camera with me?
Sure. Bring enough films, Please.
I sure will.
Carrie, Are you ok? You seem a bit down.
I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times.
Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.
Yeah but, He is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, He always shuts down and brushes me off.
Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, Anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.
I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know...
Talk to him, Try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!
You are something else you know that?
It's supposed to rain.
I really hate this weather.
Well, It won't last long.
Thank you. No. I'm late for dinner at my house. I really have to go.
Would you like to call home?
I'd appreciate that.
Please use the phone.
Thanks.
I had to look after my son at home.
What's wrong with him?
He has a fever.
Is he getting better now?
I think so. Thank you.
To be honest, I'm really fed up with work at the moment. I need a break!
Are you doing anything this weekend?
I have to work on Saturday all day! I really hate my job!
Are you available on Sunday?
Yes, That's my only day off until Thursday.
Ok, Well, My friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday. We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere, So you could still sleep in. Do you want to come with us?
That'd be fantastic! Which beach are you going to?
It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city.
What should I bring with me?
We've got plenty of inflatables, But if you want to sit on a chair, You'll have to bring your own sunlounger.
I can just use my beach towel. I love lazing around in the sun.
Do you like surfing?
I've actually never tried. Do you have a surfboard?
We've got a few. I can teach you how to surf on Sunday. It'll be fun!
I can't wait! It sounds like we're going to have a great time. How much money should I bring?
You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money. My friend is driving, So we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money.
Ok, Where and when should I meet you?
We'll pick you up at your place at noon. Be there or be square!
Positive。.
You don't think you could be wrong?
I'am absolutely sure I'm right.
I don't know. It looks a little wrong down.
This is right. There is no doubt in my mind.
You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here?
Check and double check.
I would love to help you prepare for your presentation.
I hate to ask you to do something like that.
This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that.
When could we get together?
I could easily give you some time tomorrow night.
Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door?
Yes, And could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?
I'll come prepared.
Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet.
Stop talking about her. She gives me goose bumps. I never wish to be in her sight.
She is pretty. Many men praise her highly.
Many people, Many tastes. She looks pretty, But the way she speaks gives you goose bumps. I feel sick of it.
Oh, Yes, It was very interesting.
What were the schools like?
Oh, I didn't actually teach in the schools. I taught after school. I taught in English institutes.
But you taught children, Yes?
Yes. That's right. But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America. At least as far as studying is concerned. Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school.
They actually study after school?
That's right. After their school day is over, They go to a special institute to study math or English. They are very serious about learning over there.
Hmm. That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids. Don't they ever relax?
Of course they do. You know, Eliza, Before I went over there I thought the same thing. I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much. But now that I've worked there, And taught them, I feel it is a good thing. Their parents are very concerned about their education. More than American parents are. And that is good. American kids don't study enough.
Asian cultures value learning very much. I know that.
So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education. They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing. In America, Too many parents don't pay attention.
But aren't the kids tired out? I mean, They go to school all day, And then they go to school in the evening too.
As an English teacher, I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible. I tried to have a good time with my classes. The students often enjoyed it. And if the students enjoyed it, They learned more. So it was a good experience.
Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient?
That's a stereotype we Americans have. We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet. But it's not true. There are plenty of naughty kids too.
Hmm. I know you taught in Costa Rica also. Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan?
I don't know. In Costa Rica, I taught adults. So it was a very different thing. So I really can't compare.
That's very kind of you to say so. Let's try some after-dinner wines.
Great. Sweet wines are my favorite. They always make a great finish to a decisions meal.
Do you prefer brandy or ports.
Port, Please.
Excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor.
The port is exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right?
Yes. You always have a good nose for wines.
Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.
Oh, What's that?
It's made from naturally frozen grapes.
Why not? It sounds great.
Oh, Here's to your health.
Thanks. Cheers.
Cheers.
Nothing planned. How about you?
Work is kicking my ass. I'm so stressed. Let's go grab a drink.
I'm always up for a drink. To tell you the truth, It's been quite stressful here too.
I say we get drunk tonight. I don't want to think about all this stuff.
But we have to work tomorrow.
We won't stay out too late. I just need to forget about work.
I hear ya. Let's do it.
What's changed?
My wife has been pregnant for 7 months.
I see. I guess diapers and baby food are expensive. Bringing up children is not easy.
My wife will be going back to work soon.
You should have more money then.
Yes. We will need milk powder and bassinet.
I know. Sorry, I shouldn't have rushed you, But I just couldn't stay at home and wait.
Never mind. What about taking a look around the theater?
Why not? I'd love to do that.
Here we go. There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art. ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art. )..
Wow. Look at this. So delicate and beautiful. Did ancient Chinese people really wear them?
Not really. They are just opera costumes. Do you like the embroidery?
I surely do. They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that.
No, No, No. They are all handmade, Girl. You know, The ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework.
Unbelievable! I could never do that.
Very few can. That's why these clothes only appear in the museum.
Listen! Some people are singing outside. Is it the opera?
Oh, Yes. I heard there was an opera fans club. They are probably practicing now. Wanna have a look?
Yes, Let's do it.
Follow me. Make sure not to interrupt them.
Of course not. We don't do that.
I'll teach you how to keep her.
Tell me, Please.
After you've solved this problem for me.
Thanks, Carla. That's quite a compliment coming from you. You always dress so tastefully.
Well, That dress certainly shows your good taste. It must have cost a lot.
No, Not much. I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off.
Really? You're an amazing bargain hunter! Next time there's a sale, Promise you'll let me tag along with you.
It's a promise.
It was fun, I tell you.
Tell me about it, Will you?
Well, We drove through the valley on our way there in the morning. It was a magnificent sight!
Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures?
Sure, We wouldn't miss that for anything. After that, We took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, So we got there in less than an hour.
You were lucky then.
Yeah, We spent the whole morning under the tall trees. We had our picnic there, Too.
What did you do after that?
We went for a swim in the sea. That was the biggest part of the day. Just look at my nice tan!
So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday.
Yes, You are right. And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back. My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday.
First, You need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that?
Yes, I have that.
Well, When you have that, You can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find it?
No, I don't know where the bookstore is.
Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?
Really? How can I do that?
Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?
No, I can't make it today.
I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1.
No, Thanks. I'm good.
I'll see you later then. Have a great day!
But, I want to ride it, Daddy.
Ok, I guess it's worthy of two yuan.
Great. Let's go.
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, And that I will have a passionate summer fling!
What are you talking about? Let me see that... What are horoscopes?
It's a prediction of your month, Based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, So I'm an Aries. When were you born?
January 5th.
Let's see... You're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, But you could see new, Exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting summers!
That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, And my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.
No, It's not, Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.
Well, You certainly match those criteria, But they're so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?
A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you!
Our place is spotlessly clean, Compared with others.
Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester?
In fact, I just swept the floor three days ago.
I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system.
I bet nobody will care about it.
$ 120. The small gift box is complementary.
Here is $ 150. Keep the change.
Thank you! Have a nice day!
You too. Bye.
I'm sorry, It's all my fault.
You are always like this. I've told you many times not to tell her.
Sorry, I had no intention.
It's too late to say sorry now. Oh, What am I going to do?
I know I was an idiot, But if there is anything I can do to make up, Please do tell me.
To be honest, Ava, I've just had a really bad day.
What happened?
First, I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work.
What did your boss say?
He told me that if I showed up late one more time, He'd fire me. He's so mean!
That's horrible. Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work?
That was my second time. The first time, I was in a car accident.
Is your boss Chinese?
No, He's from Australia. Before I met him, I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going. I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things.
What are you going to do?
I think I'm going to look for another job. I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss.
That sounds like a sensible plan. Do you want me to help you with your job search?
That's very generous of you. Thanks for the offer.
Don't mention it. That's what friends are for!
To tell the truth, I feel tired.
How come?
I had to visit all my relatives.
I didn't go anywhere. I stayed at home.
What's up? You look unhappy.
Nothing. I just feel very lonely in this city. I miss my family.
Oh, I know. Sometimes I have the same feeling with you. But you'd better not be so emotional.
Can you stay and accompany me for a while?
Sure, No problem. You can call me any time you are alone from now on.
Thank you so much. You are so sweet.
Not at all. We are friends.
Well, My roommate was friends with Amanda, So he introduced us.
Did he tell you what she was like first?
Yes, He described her to me, And she sounded like my type.
I do sympathize with you, I assure you.
Thank you, Sir.
I hope your grandfather will recover soon.
He's a hero in our town.
What does he look like? Is he handsome?
Yes, Indeed, People say he's the smartest young man.
He's such a buppie-a black yuppie. Black people come in all shapes and sizes. Just check out the party.
Wow! There are so many different people here. I expected mostly athletes and rappers.
You'll find some of those here, Too. But not if you don't shake it up! There's an African saying, � If you can talk, You can sing! If you can walk, You can dance! �.
Then I'll just shut up and sit down!
I just bought a new atlas. I'm looking this map of the world. Look at Russia! That's a vast country.
Canada, China, And the use are huge too.
There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.
Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, But compared to many countries in other continents, It's not very l.
Britain is half the size of france, But great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world.
The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used. Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest.
Sorry, I'm not a volleyball-fun. I'd rather play football. How about you, Mr. Wang.? Are you interested in volleyball?
I'm afraid not. My favorite is boots-running. I don't care about games.
Well, Not everyone wants to drink beer. Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice. Nothing's as refreshing asiced drinks on a hot day.
I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks, Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone. What about wine?
Just buy a cask of wine. Have you bought ice yet?
No, Once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice. The cooler, The better.
I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea. It's appetizing and tasty.
Well, If you say so. Personally speaking, I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne.
Hi! Yes, It's been a long time. I'm really glad to see you.
I'm glad to see you, Too. How'Ve you been?
Just fine. How is everything with you?
Not bad. I finally bought a house. It's an old one, But built really solid. It is close to here. Do you want to come over for lunch?
I'd like that, But I'm flying home this afternoon, And I told my parents I'd meet them at the airport for lunch.
Ok, Next time you're here.
That's a deal.
I heard that you moved to Florida.
Yes, I'm in Titusville. The space shuttle is launched from near there. I'Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches.
Tell me more.
The shuttle launches are beautiful. I saw one that took off at midnight. The whole sky got bright.
Sounds great!
I'm pretty happy living there.
I want to see Disney World, Sea World, Universal Studios, And Weeki-Watchee Springs.
I'Ve been to all of them.
I'm jealous. I'Ve never been to Florida.
The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting. Come down for a vacation sometime. I'll take you to Disney World.
That sounds great! I'll take you up on that invitation.
I hope you do. And keep in touch, Ok?
I sure will.
Here's my business card. Send me an email once in a while.
Count on it. And here's my card. Don't hesitate to call me anytime.
Thank you. I'd better get going. I don't want to be late for lunch. Mom would worry.
Well, I'm really glad we bumped into each other. Have a good trip.
Take good care of yourself, Mary.
I will. Good-bye.
Bye-bye!
What's the problem?
Should I date Tom or should I date Harry?
That's easy. If I were you, I'd date me!
But they are so silly! They're not art!
That's just your personal prejudice. Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic?
James Cameron, Of course.
Well, Did you know he was also the director of The Terminator?
Well, Nobody's perfect!
Yes. I am interested in applying for graduate school in America.
We have some catalogues from U.S. Universities. You may check in the reference stacks over there.
Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools?
Well, Generally in the U.S. Each university has its own outstanding fields. But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th.
Oh, No. It's already February 5th.
So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year.
I will think about it.
So what are you trying to say to me?
It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship. It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating.
How should I say it?
I don't want to be like this. I think we should get step further.
It has only been 6 months, Our relationship hasn't had a chance tomaturate. We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over.
Like what?
Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek.
It was only the cheek.
That is ok, Then? Starts on the cheek? Pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car.
Oh, That is ridiculous.
So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek?
Definitely not.
You see, We still have hurdle.
No, That would be too expensive. We used the train system. We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass. It lets people use the train wherever they want, As often as they want.
I've heard about Enrail passes. So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot.
Yes, They do. I wish we Americans had a better train system.
I know. Our train system is lousy. And besides, Americans love their cars too much.
I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful. They never allowed the government to develop trains.
It's too bad for the environment. So much pollution from cars.
Americans love cars for different reasons, I think. One reason is that we are very individualistic. And cars are a very individual way of getting around. Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves. They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people.
Yes, I agree. I think it is a cultural characteristic. It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this. But you know what? Probably, In the future, Americans will have to change.
Why do you say "have to"?.
Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever. I think cars are already causing global warming. When the problem gets more serious, World governments will have to start limiting car use.
Maybe you're right. They will have to develop alternative transportation. But it will be hard in America. Too many people are used to cars. Even in our movies cars are very important.
Wow! I didn't notice the time. It's almost noon. I have to get home.
Do you want me to give you a ride?
No, No problem. I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner.
Alright. Well, I'll stay here and have another coffee. Nice running into you.
See you around.
It's very hot, The temperature is often over 40C.
Do you like the weather in Seattle?
Not really. But I like it in spring and fall. I don't like it in winter.
Why?
The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day.
What about the weather in Boston?
I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter.
Is it very cold in winter?
Yes, It is. But it's nice in spring and fall.
I appreciate that.
I bought it when I was on vacation in Nepal.
You're leaving so soon. When are you off?
I'm catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning.
How about I come and see you off?
You really don't need to.
Ok. I'll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon.
I hope so, Too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything.
You're welcome.
Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me.
Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey.
Thank you. Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington.
Of course. I will.
Goodbye, Then. Thanks again for everything.
I have met a beautiful girl.
Have you fallen in love?
Yes. At first sight.
Can you describe the situation at that time?
At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by, Her tone is best, Neither over-passionate, Nor too cold.
What's her outlook?
She was pretty, Her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate, Waving gently to her shoulders. Her complexion was clear and golden.
He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep.
What? It's only 9 p.M. Now. Why today he went to bed so early?
He ran four miles and came back dead beat.
Oh, I see.
Really? Thank you. I bought it in Spring Street yesterday.
It's very nice. It goes well with your skirt.
Thank you. It's very nice of you to say so.
Not at all. This dress certainly shows your good taste.
That's quite a compliment coming from you.
I am in Nanjing University. I am a junior.
Why did you choose to attend that college?
Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing.
What kind of college is it?
Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies...
It is very dull, And the production isn't very satisfactory, Either.
You're absolutely right. I think the acting could be better.
To be fair, Both the costumes and scenery are marvelous.
Maybe you're right. But I really don't like it.
Well, We'd better go to a musical comedy next time. I think the one we saw last month was very good.
Yes, They had constant changes of scene, And I love variety.
Me, Too. I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another.
Neither. The game ended in two all.
But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized.
But the Brazilian is tougher.
Oh, But I suppose he has lots of talents.
He is a bootlicker. I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake.
I know! I hate it! But I'm taking this crash course in math.
Why?
I have to take my exams for getting into the university, So I need to prepare.
Do you think it will help?
It has to! I'Ve been studying every day, Eight hours a day! I don't know, But the school has a great success record.
Hmm... Maybe I should sign up too.
I'll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow.
Oh, Yes. You?
Yes. What did you think of it?
I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it. What did you think of it?
I liked it, Too. It was scary, But not disgusting. I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins. He's brilliant.
Mmm. That's what I thought, Too. And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins.
Oh, Yes, He is brilliant. What's the name of the young actor?
Hum, Edward Norton, Or something like that.
Yes. He was excellent. They worked well together.
She didn't expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day's hard work.
Poor girl!
You did? That is great!
Yeah, I am having a party thissaturday night, A sort of house warming, And i want to invite you. Are you busy?
No i am free, I will be there, What time the thing starting?
Around seven.
Ok, Great, Should i bring anything?
No, But thanks for offering, Actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat, Do you have any?
Sure, I will be happy to bring a few, What is the address?
Don't worry, I will come to pick you up at about six thirty.
Got it.
No, But I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend.
Yes, That was surprising. I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go.
They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood.
They're also one of the richest couples. They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want.
I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars.
Did either one of them win an Oscar this year?
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films, But I don't think he won anything.
Tom Cruise may be handsome, But I think he's a bit crazy, Don't you?
Yes, His marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous.
I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves.
People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated.
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you.
That's true. I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go.
Thank goodness we're not rich and famous!
Being famous, I can do without, But I wouldn't mind being rich.
What? What did you buy?
It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it!
What is it? Why did you buy a brick?
There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick.
And?
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.
And it's a brick?
Yes.
I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?
I wanted to. But he said, No, The box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, Other people won't believe it's new.
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.
Yes, It was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products. Look, It even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?
He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.
Aha! Now I understand. You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk. So, What I think is, You deserve to get cheated!
C'mon, Don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it. We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.
That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.
You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it. How could I fall for such a trick?
I am a girl of many interests. I like dance, Chess, Collecting stamps, Travelling and taking photos.
What kind of dance do you like?
I like rumba and tango.
Great. I am not interested in Chinese chess. It is too difficult for me.
You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess. Both of them are much easier.
Ok, I will try. As for stamp, Don't you think it is an expensive hobby?
Yes, It is. But it is full of fun and knowledge. What about you, What do you like to do as hobby?
I like gardening. I take care of them everyday. I like those flowers and the swing in my garden. If the weather is nice, I would like to lie on the lawn.
Sounds pleasant.
Yes, It's one of the main air pollutants. Factories don't emit it directly into the air. It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight.
Sorry? What does VOC stand for?
Oh, Vous are 'volatile organic compounds'. That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint.
So, What damage does ozone do to the environment?
Well, It can cause smog, Which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties.
Really? He deserves it! They should teach him a good lesson.
But the word is his brother would go bail for him. Last time it's his father who went bail for him.
Then he is really lucky.
I don't have the day off. Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today, All of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week.
Are you serious? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike...
It happens quite often, Actually. Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group, The first thing they do is to call a strike. Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again. Anyhow, It's a nice, Unanticipated holiday...
I'll have to sleep on it.
I'm very sorry I can't.
Why not?
I'm afraid I have some business to attend to.
Then would you like to have lunch with us?
I'd love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now.
Would you like me to give you a lift?
No, Thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there.
Come on. It's no trouble at all.
Ok, Thank you.
I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in, Like football.
I mean which ones are they better at than men?
Why do you care? Women and men are different all around. I don't think they can be compared.
That's a good point. Let me change my question. What sports do women like best?
Well, I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports.
Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized?
Are you suggesting that anyone can be?
Well, I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear. That makes you very graceful and mysterious.
Yeah, That's a good idea. Let me try it.
Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace. Very attractive on formal occasions.
Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes?
Sure, More elegant and taller.
I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy. The face powder will lighten my skin color.
If I were your date, I would be so charmed by you.
Thank you.
Perfect! Couldn't be better.
You made a good choice, Then?
It's just what I want.
No regrets.
I am really pleased with it.
I am glad you are happy.
It's super.
What's the occasion? You won the lottery?
No. Just want to relax a little bit. You don't have to win the lottery to relax, Do you?
Well, I am kind of broke.
Come on. It's on me.
Really? It's very nice of you.
Don't be silly. I'll take you anywhere you wanna go.
Wonderful! You know what? I wish you wanted to relax everyday.
Dream on!
No, I don't mind in the least. I want to do something of my own. What about you?
I do. I don't know what to do after I retire. I'd like to work till I drop.
Kobe Bryant, Of course.
Kobe? I know him, The key guy of the Lakers, A heck of a NBA player. He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense.
He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers, But what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand.
Maybe he is not good ay rebounding?
Indeed, No man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard. Rebounding might not be his strong suit.
Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics. Did you go to the match between China and USA?
Who wouldn't! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him.
Well then, What are your spoils?
Well, Nothing more than a jumble of photographs.
Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine?
Yes, But it's checked out.
What a pity! I missed it again.
It's popular you know. You want to reserve it?
Yes, Please.
Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book.
Thank you. What shall I do when I check out these books?
Take the card, And fill in your name and library card number.
Thank you so much.
Study English.
You mean you like to study English? Why?
It gives me great satisfaction.
Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work.
I don't mind the work. I think it's worthwhile.
What is it?
The state of economy is starting to go up in our country.
That's just the short in the arm we need.
Yes. What do you want?
Did your bid win?
What do you care,Dork?
Hey! I'm trying to be nice, And you still want to fight! Did you get the statue or not?
You mean fat boy?
Sorry. I take that back. I mean the copper Buddha you wanted.
Of course not, Help yourself.
What are you studying?
I have a test tomorrow.
Sure. I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year.
Are you sure you can do well this year?
I am 100 % certain.
According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.
I am sure I can get a 95 this time.
I know this characteristic of him. So I never think seriously of his words.
Yeah. This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person.
It seems that you don't like him.
You like to communicate with him?
Yes, And would you like to have seats in the front or at the back?
In the front, Please.
That's 35 yuan each.
Thank you. And what's on tomorrow?
Tarzan.
Can we get tickets now?
I am afraid not. Tomorrow is premiere.
Sorry. Was I disturbing you?
Yes. And something else, Please don't borrow my clothes without asking.
Sorry. I guess I wasn't thinking. I won't do it again.
Absolutely! Everything that's thrilling turns me on.
So I'Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you.
What is it?
Oh, Never mind. I am just going to do the laundry today.
I want to apologize. Is there anything can do for you?
It really doesn't matter at all. I never did like it anyway.
I trust you're keeping well?
I'm doing great, Thank you.
So we can get down to business.
Yes, That is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?
I love anything with chocolate the best.
I like chocolate myself.
Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?
I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it.
I haven't ever cared for that myself.
Have you ever had garlic ice cream?
That sounds absolutely disgusting!
It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, Though.
Oh, I feel ok but I'm still very tired.
It's probably jet lag.
I think so. One minute I feel quite awake, And the next I feel very tired.
Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city?
Oh yes, I'm very interested in Chinese history so I'd like to visit the Summer Palace.
Good idea. I'd be very happy to go there.
It's a skill. What can I say? I don't know why, I just have a long routine.
Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl's routine be so complicated? You get up, You shower, You get dressed, You brush your teeth, You're out the door. Half an hour,Tops.
Jacob, You have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don't. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it's a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, But usually I do it in the morning. In all, Getting dressed takes about half an hour, At which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I'll put my hair up, Butoften times I bloody it straight. And then, Because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That's another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.
True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, Even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, How long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?
Not funny.
No. I just went cold turkey, And I never smoked again.
Nice to meet you.
May I know your name, Please?
I'm RoseTeller. I think I'Ve seen you somewhere before?
Ah, Yes. I remember now. Were you Mr. John's dinner partner last month?
Yes, I was. You work for 3M, Right?
I did but now I'm for Microsoft. How are things with you?
Good.
May I know what you do?
I'm a fashion designer. Next month, I have a fashion show. I'd love it if come. I can get you a couple of tickets. So you can bring a friend if you like.
Sure. That would be great. Good luck.
Thank you.
It's not cheesy! It's romantic. When it first came out, I saw it in the theaters five times in one week.
Really? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997, But when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy.
Alright, Maybe it's a little bit cheesy. But come on, Isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while?
Actually, I have to admit that you're right. I like some pretty cheesy movies too. I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks, Especially "Terminator.".
Haha, That's definitely a cheesy movie too. Did you watch it over and over again?
Well... I saw it only once, But for the next two months when I talked to people, I pretended I was the Terminator.
Yes. I am very interested in the Olympic Games, And I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Me, Too. I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics.
That's cool. Care for a little quiz on that?
No problem. I'm an 'Olympic expert'..
Wow, You've talked the talk. Now it's time to walk the walk. Here we go. First, Can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics?
The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece.
Good. Why do people name it Olympics?
They name it after the place where it was first held.
Who started the modern Olympics?
This question is a piece of cake. A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin.
What did people call him?
Of course he was called 'the father of the Olympics'..
What did he do for restoring the Olympics?
He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics '..
Well, That's for all. Excellent!
I've told you I'm an expert.
Oh, It's too far to walk there. We can take a bus.
Is the bus station close by?
Yeah, It's a block away down the street.
Oh, Don't go yet. Let's at least have one more.
No, Thank you. I can't.
It's too bad that you have to leave so early.
Thank you very much. I had a really good time.
Thanks for coming! We should meet again sometime soon.
That would be great! Actually, Can I get your phone number, Ella? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime.
Anytime. You can reach me 5558929.
Ok, Got it. I'll call you sometime next week.
Fine.
It's time to go and I hope we can get together again soon.
I hope so, Too. Bye! Ben.
Sure, No problem. Asking for leave again? You have been absent from class five times this semester.
I know. But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time. No more than one third of her students will go to her class.
I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well. Most students either sleep or do other things in her class.
Yeah, My boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me. Or I chat with my friends through text messages.
Fortunately her class is just an elective course, Not as important as compulsory courses.
Right, So we must spare some time to attend selective courses.
But isn't it too impolite to be absent?
What can I do? I have things to do in Students 'Government.
Oh, I thought you just gave an excuse on this note.
Sometimes I will try various excuses. But this is my last time asking for leave. Or I will have a bad record.
Yeah, Besides, Your credit will be deducted. That is kind of serious.
I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students 'Government.
You can't write with one hand and draw with the other.
I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government. But before that, I must do my job. Bye. Don't forget about that note.
You can count on me.
How regular?
An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey, The worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that.
You are kidding me? It is against the labor law. They should be aware of their rights.
But these people say nothing about that. They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days.
That's not right, Somebody should do something.
Sorry, We have sold out the tickets.
What's on tomorrow at that time?
' Beautiful Mind 'will be playing again. And there's also' Titanic '..
Terrific, That's a wonderful movie, I like it very much. Can I get tickets now for tomorrow?
Yes, 20 yuan for each.
Two tickets, Please.
Ok. Here you are.
A teacher.
But if I were you, I would be a singer. You've got such a beautiful voice.
I wouldn't like to be a singer, But I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing, That dream developed in my mind when I was a child.
Are you sure about that?
I'm quite sure. I've always loved working with children.
He has no sense.
If I were him, I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money.
But Joe won't you.
Excuse me, What did you say?
A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games.
That's incredible. I can't believe it.
You have to. It is sure.
How amazing!
But many roads are very narrow.
Not always, And there're also few cars!
Yes, Because of fewer people.
Steven! What's going on! Who were those guys? I didn't know you have a gun! What's going on!
I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, Ok? For now, You have to trust me, Please! I would never do anything to hurt you.
Steven, I...
I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica, I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States. I'm a spy for the Indian government.
What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here?
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, And my father was a renowned chemist. One day, He was approached by members of the CIA, Claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most importantly, Why did you lie to me!
I'm sorry, I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, But you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.
I can't believe this! Why are all these things happening to me! I can't take it anymore! Let me out of the car!
Veronica, Wait!
Sure. What's playing?
Well, Let me check the newspaper. What about The Terminal?
Wow, It stars Catherine Zeta-Jones, My favorite actress.
Well, Birds of a feather flock together. I like her too. She was in a lot of dramas.
She is so beautiful and elegant. And she is famous for her fine acting.
What's more, She doesn't have scandals. And she likes to take part in the charitable activities.
Who is the director?
Steven Spielberg. Another superstar.
Yes, A legend, Also. I still remember, His movies, Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994.
Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly?
It tells a romantic and humorous love story.
This is really exciting movie. Lets go to this one.
Give him a chance.
Thank you! The same to you.
Have you got any plans?
I've been invited over to a friend's. And you?
My roommate's having a party.
I can play the piano a bit.
Then we can have one more program at our party?
No, No. My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public.
Thank you. You are cooking up a storm.
Wouldn't you like some more chicken?
No, Thank you. I'm afraid I can't take in anymore.
Oh! I feel really under the weather. I'Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough.
Oh dear. Maybe you'Ve caught a cold.
Yes, I'Ve had lots of overtime to do recently and I haven't slept much at all.
Well then, You should get some rest this weekend and don't go out drinking.
Yes, I think you're right!
Hi, Andy.
Are you feeling OK? You sound a little tired this morning.
I did not sleep much last night. I really feel bad. It was a crazy night.
What happened?
I had a bad dream. I was walking alone in the graveyard, And suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves. They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood.
Oh, What a nightmare! Then what happened?
My mother woke me up. She had heard me crying out for help.
You have got a great mother.
I felt embarrased. After all, I am 18 years old. Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk.
That sounds good!
Yeah, But i was afraid to fall back asleep. I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan.
Me too. But I tell myself that if they don't accept me, Another school will.
No, I'm full. My stomach isn't growling at me any more.
I know what you mean. I'm so full that I can burst. Shall we go then?
I'm all set. Thank you for the dinner, Jack.
You are welcome.
Part-timer? Is that a new buzzword?
Oh, It's pretty popular among my classmates these days. So are you?
Sure, I have a part-time job as a bartender.
Cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar!
Yeah, But I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, The manager would be pretty upset.
That's true. I'm wondering did you learn anything from the job?
Of course. There's always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world.
You mean you got working experience, Right?
Not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.
It must be very demanding.
Sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, It's easy to figure out.
Really? It sounds interesting.
Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I'll show you around.
Great. I'm looking forward to it.
What? Why do we have to do that?
Well, At the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, To take better advantage of the daylight available, We compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.
I see. That's convenient! I never understood things like this, Such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, We are in Pacific Standard Time, That is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, Then we were in China Standard Time, And that's eight time zones east of Greenwich!
That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time difference, Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, We still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It's like we went back in time!
What?
The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared. He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class. It was so embarrassing.
Yes, She does. She is good at backstroke and free style.
Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke.
But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke.
Really? Then just ask her to follow me.
I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming, Aren't you?
Yes. But I still have some difficulties it breathing.
Say, Kid, Keep on practicing, You're sure to be a first-class swimmer.
To tell you the truth, I have never thought of being a swimmer. I swim just for fun.
That's good.
How did he make a fortune?
He didn't make any effort. His aunt died and left him a fortune.
I think it's a great idea. Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities. Are you planning on going abroad?
Yes, I hope so. I am studying for my BELTS right now.
Which country do you want to go to?
I'd like to study in the UK, But it's really expensive.
Have you applied to any schools there?
Yes, I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago.
Congratulations! That's excellent news? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer?
I have to get an BELTS score of 7. 5 overall. Do you think I can do that?
If you study hard, I don't see why you wouldn't. Have you received any other offers?
I was also accepted into Yale University, And Sydney University.
If you're worried about money, The cost of living is lowest in America. However, If you go to Oxford University, You'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future.
I just can't decide where to go. It's not an easy decision to make.
If I were you, I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide. Whatever you do, I know you'll succeed.
Thank you, But I am in a terrible mood indeed.
I enjoy camping.
Really? I'm not much of an outdoor person. What do you like about it?
I love the fresh air, The scenery the exercise, And the time to think.
Do you hike or fish on your trips?
Yes, Both. Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles.
Did you catch anything?
Yes, But I threw them back.
How about Joining our summer camp next week?
Great! I can't wait.
Yeah, It helps keep me fit and helps the environment, Too.
One less car on the road means less pollution.
Right. Since my work is near a park, It's a really nice ride, Too.
How far is it?
Oh, About 10 miles. It takes me about an hour.
That doesn't sound too bad. I wish I could do it, But I work in the city. So I take the train.
You're doing your part for the environment by using public transportation, Too.
True. Well, See you tomorrow.
See you.
No, What?
I hear that he's quitting.
You're kidding!
I'm afraid not! Now this is just between you and me.
Well. All right, Mark. Just this once. But you have to pick them up yourself. I'm a very busy man.
Oh, That's all right. It's very kind of you. Can I come around now?
I'd rather you didn't come immediately as I said I'm very busy at the moment. Come after lunch, Mark.
And then she made the deal with MicroPower. Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million...
Fifteen? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five?
That's right. Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her.
Anyway, I'm still happy I left. I'm working as a freelancer now.
You really should have stayed with us, Dave.
Me too. I get much more done when I am under the gun.
Uh, I don't know what to say. What do you want to know?
What's your method of learning?
Let me think a minute. I think I always try to take every chance to practice.
What if there is no chance? I mean what if you don't have a partner, What will you do?
Well, I talk to myself. That is, I play one role first, Then the other.
That's a good idea. You are really creative.
Sorry, I really can't do that. There's little time left for us.
I can't accept your excuse. It's five o'clock.
Yeah. But I have an appointment with Ann.
Ok, Sounds good. But I think it's your trick.
Hello, Steven!
How are you doing?
Not bad. What about you?
I'm just a little tired.
Why?
I have a lot of work to do in the company recently.
How is your family?
Pretty fine, Thanks.
Where are you going now?
I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents. Oh, It's two o' clock. I must go now.
Ok, See you next time.
See you.
Hi, Mary. Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party.
What do you think of the traffic today?
It's pretty bad.
Yeah. You can say that again. It's noisy too.
I am glad I did not drive a car.
I like spring.
Why?
Oh, Everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer.
I like spring, Too. We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air.
Aha. I've read of my roommate. I made a move today.
Really? What was the matter?
You knew Brain Locker?
Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like?
Well, He's thin and tall. He has brown hair, A holt nose, Green eyes and wearing glasses.
Mm. I've seen him a couple of times, I think.
Good. Thanks for asking.
What may I do for you?
I need help with something.
What do you need help with?
I am looking for a newspaper article.
Have you looked in the periodicals?
I didn't even think about that.
I can show you where they are.
That would be a lot of help.
Follow me, Please.
Thank you so much.
Some routine job. Files, Documents, Faxes and so on.
Are you usually busy?
It depends. Sometimes I am very busy.
What depends?
Oh, That means I can't make sure for my own.
Oh, I see.
Well, Some people use a standard set of words, But many couples today write their own wedding vows.
Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting, But it didn't look like real rice to me.
It wasn't. It was birdseed. We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it.
Oh, I didn't think of that. Well, This reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China. Plenty of food and drink, Music and dancing, And interesting traditions.
Wait until you see what happens next! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet. Let's go over and watch.
She's got quite a crowd around her. Oh, Look! That little girl caught it!
She's my friend's ten-year-old niece. I guess there won't be another wedding in this family for a long time.
I've been feeling under the weather recently. I caught a bad cold last week, And I still haven't got over it.
Well, You wanna take a sick leave? All you need now is a good, Long rest.
I guess so. Even though I seem to be over the worst of it. I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office.
Good idea.
Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other.
Did she give up her decision to marry Dick?
No, I encourage her to go her own way, But she's now having a change of heart.
Sure. You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls?
Yes.
These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library. Together they constitute the library's "card catalog". You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another. Fox example, This drawer goes from SCA to SCM.
So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society, I'd just look under 'A'..
No. You'd look under 'W'. The articles'a' and 'the' don't count in our alphabetization, And cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as'history of', 'introduction to','story of' and so forth.
What if I don't know the title of the book?
Well, You can look under the author's name.
Could you give me an example?
Suppose you want to find a book by your professor, William Smith. You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM. Since that's very common name, You may have to go through several 'William Smith' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in.
What's up?
I want to invite you to go to the movies.
Are you asking me for a date?
Yes.
I don't like to go to the movies on a date. It's noisy there.
Where do you want to meet?
Let's go to the coffee shop then. It's quiet there.
What time should we meet?
How about seven?
All right.
Tomorrow?
Yeah, I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie.
That sounds great.
Yes. We can do something else if you like.
Ok. Dinner and a movie will be perfect.
Well. What time would you like me to pick you up?
How about 7 o'clock?
Good. I will see you then.
Ok. Bye.
Bye.
It's as plain as the nose on your face. They're dating each other.
You're pulling my leg! She must be thirty years younger than Leo. Talk about robbing the cradle!
Well, You can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan.
It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week.
I think you are absolutely right. Actually, My father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks. They got married a month later.
No way. I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself. Plus, What if it's Vince?
I don't think so. Your admirer seems kind of sweet. Aren't you even a little curious about him?
He's just a distraction, Like a mosquito buzzing in my ear. I want no distractions.
A little distraction might do you some good, Zina.
I'm sorry to have made you disappointed.
That's all right. But why were you so rude to me at lunch.
Was I? Sorry, I didn't mean to be. I do apologize.
And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?
Forgive me darling. I'm very tired.
Pretty good, Sam. Only the awful weather, You know.
That's right. I'Ve never really liked it since I got here.
Me either, But I'm dealing with it anyway.
Sounds not bad! You know, The only thing I worried about is the safety. I'm not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport.
Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first. There're some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise.
I will think about it.
Come on! It is really a fun game.
It's my new pendant. Do you like it?
Is that Hello Kitty?
Yes, In a monkey suit. It's adorable!
Is it real gold?
Yeah. Two-toned, White and yellow.
Why?
Look at the girls in the street. They all have bunch of flowers. Is it Valentine's Day?
Oh, Yes! I completely forgot about it.
Did you have a fight with Jack?
No, But now he'll be in trouble. What's a boyfriend for? To forget about Valentine's Day?
Come on, Dear! You forgot it, Too.
You know, It's OK for a girl to forget these "big days", But for a guy, To do that is unforgivable.
Is that your phone?
Oh, It's Jack. Excuse me.
Wow! Good timing.
He asked me out to a dinner tonight. How about joining us?
Come on! Three's a crowd!
So what?
Just go! It's Valentine's Day!
Sure. I'Ve never seen a dragon boat race.
Really? I think you'll love it.
As long as I don't have to row.
I'm sure you'll soon begin to like it. It's such an interesting subject.
But I don't think I'll ever show my liking to math.
Can't be better! Bob, Aren't you glad the semester is over?
Yep! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night?
I didn't think much of it. Are you?
Sure. Would you like go with me?
Sounds like fun.
You'll have to buy your own ticket though.
Are you broke again? Let me treat you.
Wow! When did you come into so much cash?
You know, I am a waitress at the student center. Anyway now those final exams are almost over. I'd love a night out.
Can't bear it, Right? I've been there before. I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages, Like there is something missing.
Yeah, That's right. If no one sends me test messages, I'll go crazy.
Actually, This is a kind of addiction called "infomania" or"information overload"..
Addiction? Checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? No way!
Yes, It is. Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day?
Absolutely.
Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time?
Yeah, It's a must. Otherwise, I may miss important phone calls and text messages.
Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer?
Yes. MsN, QQ, Skype, Google Talk, Ali wangwang, Everything, So that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives.
Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information.
I'Ve been playing computer games.
What? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore? What are you playing?
It's called Counter Strike. It's a first person shooter game. It's awesome. It's a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.
You'Ve been wasting your time on this? I can't believe it! It doesn't even look fun or challenging!
My laptop is on my bed. If you think it's so easy then get on line and try to beat me.
Fine!
Damp it! How are you killing me with a single shot? It's not fair! I don't want to play anymore! Let's go get something to eat.
Can you bring me something? I am totally hooked on this game!
He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley.
If he doesn't change his attitude toward work, I don't think a new job can make any difference.
He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man.
It's too good to be true! If I were there, I would ask him if he himself was a successful man.
Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question, You know.
Hmm... You look too dressed up. How about this purple top and these jeans?
Well, That top is a little too tight, And those jeans aren't dressy enough. And I don't feel comfortable with that. What do you think, Vicky? You'Ve been very quiet up to now.
Be confident. Wear styles you're going to be comfortable in.
I know. But my life seems super stressful. I really don't know how to get a better grab on things.
I think as long as you try your best and don't think of anything too much, Everything will be all right.
Let me see it.
Who's the letter from?
It's a letter from UCLA about my acceptance.
Read it!
UCLA accepted me!
Really?
I'm not joking. I got accepted!
I'm so happy for you!
UCLA was my second choice, But I'm happy knowing I'Ve been accepted.
I am really proud of you.
You have no idea how proud I am of myself.
I heard it might rain.
Oh. That's a pity. I thought that we might go hiking in the hills.
Mmm... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead.
Yes that might be a better idea.
Maybe we'll meet some of the artists too.
Ok - let's do that then!
Yes, It's to my liking, Too.
Say, How would you like to be a dress designer?
It's my dream.
I use it almost every day, But I usually only use it to check my email. I don't often surf the net. You use the internet a lot, Don't you?
Yes. I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company. It can be frustrating when the connection is poor.
So, You're online eight hours a day.
Yes, I like the job though. Sometimes, I help other people in the office if they're having trouble online.
How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information?
I think it's fairly useful, But there are two big problems. First, A lot of the information you find online is false. Second, When you buy something online, You don't see it until you actually get it.
How do you solve the website problems when you're buying something online?
What I do is find the website of shops. Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they're seen that the products are genuine and suitable.
Right. With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies, People are getting more and more dependent on the web.
One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores.
Can you tell me how it is done?
If a customer is interested in some certain goods, He can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen, And then the customer can place an order online to the sales company. And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home. The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge.
I see. So great.
Fine! How are you?
I'm fine too, Thank you.
I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening. Will you come with me? I've two complimentary tickets.
With the greatest pleasure. Where is the concert this evening?
It will be held at the Music Hall.
What's on the program?
It's a piano recital. I'm fond of piano, You know.
Yes. It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city.
Right. Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery.
Great, Let's go.
Wow, What a beautiful lake! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery.
En, It's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it.
I feel as if I'm living in a different world, Honey.
The same to me. All the things here make me happy, The mountain, The water, The grass, The birds, The sunshine...
I think we should go out more frequently. The natural scenery can do us good.
That's the point. We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time.
Right. The city life has made us tired and out of energy, While the natural world can bring us quite new feelings.
If you are really in love with your wife, You should be in support of her. You can't have it both ways, Of course.
You mean I should please her by following her suggestion.
Yeah. Love me, And love my dog.
What for?
Thanks ; do you like it?
Not really. I was being sarcastic. Does it come with the job?
Yes, Everyone on the sales floor has to wear one. They're supposed to make us look more professional.
They're not actually that bad. They could be worse. What do you think about it?
I don't mind it, Actually. I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day.
So are you enjoying your new job?
It's much better than my old one. My new boss is great.
How do you like working in sales?
I like the fact that I get to work with people. It makes the day go by much faster.
That's good. Have you met Jane yet? She's the intern in the international travel department.
Yeah, I've met her. She's a genius saleswoman!
I know! She could sell fridges to Eskimos!
How do you know her?
She's my cousin.
Why didn't you tell me about that before?
I don't know. I didn't think it was that interesting.
Well, Now that I know that, Maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime.
That's a good idea. Let's discuss after work.
This is very beautiful. Though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming!
That's fine! Don't worry about it!
What was that?
Relax, It was just a goat!
And that?
It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later.
What was that?
Honey, Seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax!
Relax, That was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.
You know what? I don't think I can hack it here out in the countryside. I'm going back to the city!
All of your coursework is important, Including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester.
Does the final count the most?
All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times.
How do you total our scores?
The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework, Attendance, And quizzes are the rest.
What if we are out sick?
Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.
How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?
Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on.
Really? Tell me about some of the plants they showed.
Well. There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them.
Is that type of plant found in this country?
No, It isn't. It's a pity, Because I'd like to see it in action.
So would i. What other unusual plants did they show?
They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, When the insect molle.
That's very specialized. So, The insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, The other would too.
That's right. That's one reason why it's so important to protect every species.
I see. The plants that fascinate me most are cacti. I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions.
According to the documentary, They have an incredible ability to find water supplies, However small, And then store them without losing much through evaporation.
That's why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves, To reduce water loss.
That's great! Congratulations.
I really don't know how I can thank you enough.
Oh, It's my pleasure. After all, You are very qualified for the position.
Thank you very much indeed. You helped me rebuild my self-confidence.
Don't mention it. You're always been good. What do you say we go out to celebrate?
That would be great.
It's a man-made wonder. I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it.
Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon.
That's true.
What's wrong? That was a great goal.
Yes, But I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars!
Looks like you're going to lose out on this game then.
I can't believe it! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure.
What were the odds?
20 to 1, In favour of the Cougars!
Too bad.
Sorry, I can't. I have to work late at the laboratory.
Nigel, You sure lead a dog's life, What's up with that?
My boss wants me to finish this project tonight.
He's very strict with us.
And I hear he gives very good lectures.
Indeed. He's strict with himself too.
I know! It's gonna be great. But what kind of music do you think we should play?
That's a good question. You know I love hip hop, So maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs.
Hmm... Vanilla Ice? I know his most famous song, "Ice Ice Baby," but I don't know his other songs.
That's OK. You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them.
Don't worry. I'm almost finished.
I need you to hurry up.
All right. I'm finished.
I think there's more you need to do.
What do you mean by that?
My hair looks awful.
What don't you like about it?
I just don't like my hair.
I'm sorry that you don't like it.
I won't be paying you for this.
I'm sure we can work something out.
You don't love me, Roy.
Why do you say such words? I love you very much.
No, You used to be. But not now. You are in love with someone else. You are in love with my friend, Janet. You appreciate her very much. You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I'm dumb and uninteresting.
Susan, Just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her. There is nothing for you to be jealous about. I like your company much better than Janet's.
I envy her and also I hate her at the same time.
Honey, You should know that I love you so deeply.
Oh, Shut up, Roy.
But honey, I think you're terrific. There is nothing...
Oh, ShUT UP!
I like current affairs programmes and documentaries, Especially wildlife ones. How about you?
I like those kinds of programmes too. They're very informative. I think that many people underrate the education value of tv.
I agree. People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence.
Yeah. And that's so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational!
Right. You can't blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes.
In my country, There's a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown. I think it's about six minutes per hour.
That's great idea. But don't the tv station lose a lot of money because of that?
No. They don't. They simply charge higher prices at peak times. Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country?
Not as far as I know. We have so many advertisements. The interruptions are unbearable sometimes! That's one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv, Where you pay a fixed amount each mo.
Some people have satellite and cable tv in my country, But people don't seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes. Besides, The terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes.
Well, There's a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes. Shall we?
Goodbye.
Sure.
Please count on my love.
I will.
I'll be yours through endless time.
I see. And I'll always be devoted to you.
Thank you. I know I've nothing to offer you, But I'll never give you reason to cry.
I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie.
My love will grow, Like a river to flow.
It can't be dry, And can't die.
I don't know whether we are in a dream.
Aha, Aha...
Hi, John, I am trying to find a carpenter.
Why?
Well, I want to build a deck in my back yard.
What for?
So I can have a special place to hang out with friends, And also do some barbecuing on weekends.
That sounds cool. Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job?
You? Do you have a carpenter's license?
Yes, Of course. But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle.
Wow! That's cool. So, Let me give you some details about the deck I want.
Please go ahead, I am listening.
I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door.
Is your back door higher than the ground level?
Yes, The back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground.
Okay, Then you need a deck with a guardrail.
I don't like things to be fancy.
Don't worry. I will build your deck with a simple but classic look.
Hmm, That's good. Can you use cedar or redwood to build it?
Cedar is a good choice.
Well, Let's take the measurements right now.
Not really.
Don't mention it.
Good night then!
Good night!
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
It's sounds like fun.
It's very dangerous, You know.
I want to try something exciting.
It's an easy way to get hurt, Let me tell you.
I'll tell you all about it next Monday.
Well, Take care of yourself, And don't say I didn't warn you.
What is it?
She keeps talking when I'm reading.
There must be something wrong with her.
Well, I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally, But he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image.
That is exactly what the poll shows. Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term, His approval rating is as high as 66 percent.
I don't find this surprising. The poll data sound quite right. He is a good president.
But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president.
Chinese, Maths, English, Chemistry, Physics, Biology and so on.
What do you think about the teachers?
To be honest, I like most of them, Except for my Chinese teacher. She is quite young, But her class is too boring!
That's too bad. Do you have any foreign teachers?
Yes, My oral English teacher is an American. He is from a small town in California.
What is he like?
He is great. He always tells us not to study for exams, And to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing.
Are you able to follow him?
Not everything, But nearly. He speaks very clearly.
Oh, That's good! He sounds like a good teacher.
Absolutely! If you come to our class, I am sure you will like him.
You should go to the library to find some information about American universities, And write to the Admission Office. Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials. From experience, Many applicants write to several universities instead of just one.
I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply.
That is true. I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities. First of all, You need official transcripts of your undergraduate work, Three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence, And the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ). Then you need a financial guarantee, And an application fee of 25 dollars.
What's to come next?
If they agree to enroll you, They will send you aTAP - 66 Form. WithTAP - 66, You can apply for a passport from our government, And then apply for a visa from the US. Embassy in Beijing.
How long will it take to go over all the procedures?
From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well.
Thank you. I appreciate your help.
You are welcome. Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
Sure. Take a seat... What would you like to know?
First, I'Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story.
That's correct. It's a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago. The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case.
How do you research your books?
I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories. Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction! I usually base my characters on people I have met. Most charact.
I really like your books. I'Ve just finished this one. I read it from cover to cover in a single day. Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again!
Thank you. Let met sign it for you... There you go.
Oh! Thank you very much. I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories. What are the stories about?
There's a real mix of stories in the book. I haven't finished all of them yet, Though. Many of them are short detective stories, But there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones. If you give me your.
Thanks very much. I'm sure it will sell well. I can't wait to read it. Here's my card. Thank you for you time.
What's her last name?
It's Snow.
What color are her eyes?
They're blue.
What color is her hair?
It's brown.
How old is she?
She's 42.
Not really, I like watching horror movies, Like 'The Unborn.'.
You like horror movies? I don't like them because they're too scary! I like comedies because I love to laugh.
I like horror movies because I like to be scared.
No problem, We have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done.
I'm done.
That looks great, But I will also need your driver's license or other form of I.D.
Sure, Here it is.
Well, This looks nice. Do you know how to use it?
I am pretty sure how to use it, But can you remind me?
Of course, Just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.
I see.
Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits!
I met her about one year ago.
So you met her right after you got to school?
That's right. We've been dating since last September.
Of course not. I'm afraid of them.
I mean, Do you like snake meat?
I'm afraid I'll feel sick at the sight of it.
During the weekend I often take the family out on short trips.
That sounds interesting.
Yes, It helps me to relax.
Do you have any hobbies?
I like to paint.  .
What kind of things do you paint?
Mainly seascapes.
What kinds of sports do you like?
I like almost all sports, And I enjoy both playing and watching. I especially like tennis and mountain climbing. I was in the climbing club all through school.
Hello, My old friend. Long time no see. How are you doing?
Well, I'm doing okay. And how about yourself?
Not so well. To be honest with you, I broke up with Tom.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
I need to check out this book.
Do you have your library card?
I don't have one.
Would you like to apply for one right now?
That's fine.
I'm going to need you to fill out the application.
All right. All done.
All right, Now please sign the back of the card.
Okay. I'Ve signed it.
That's all there is to it.
Great. Now can I check out this book?
Well, Pretty good.
I'm glad to hear that. What impressed you most?
Well, The cultural differences impressed me most.
You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans?
That's right, Quite different. One day one of my American friend looked pale, So I asked him whether he was sick or not. But he was reluctant to answer my question.
That's weird.
And what's more, When he told me he had caught a cold for several days, I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible.
You really cared about your friend.
Sure I am. But he responded by saying'what do you mean? '..
I'm confused. Why did he say that?
I felt the same at first. Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick. Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor. But back in China, Helping others is always regarded being kind.
Absolutely. Now I understand why he responded that way.
And he himself is very diligent. Considering all these, I think he has the ball at his feet.
But he has to stick to it and to it long enough.
That's pretty advanced.
Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement.
Is that where you park?
Yes, The car park is under constant video surveillance, So my car is quite safe. Please get in.
Thank you. Where is your key?
There's no need, I have keyless entry, And the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car. Now, We can look at the navigation system to find the best route home.
That's amazing, It even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment.
Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home. Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out.
Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves.
Maybe, But in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door?
Here it is, And here we are.
When I turn off my home alarm, The house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level.
I have to get home, But I don't need all of this fancy technology, I think I'll just walk.
Yeah, I'm going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains.
Oh, Do you go hiking often?
I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.
It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?
Sure. But, It will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?
Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.
Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.
Yeah, My friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.
Well, Bring him along too. We'll have a great time this weekend.
Thanks, I'll ask him.
No, Not at all. Go ahead.
Are you married?
Yes. Is that so important?
Frankly yes. We like to employ married people. By the way, Do you have any children?
Yes, I have a three-year-old son.
Mark, This is Lucy.
What's up?
I have a friend. He is my best friend and he wants to learn English. He would pay about 100 yuan per hour. Are you interested?
I don't know.
So I take it you are not interested.
No, Lucy. Don't get me wrong. I mean school will be open on Sept. 2nd, And I will have a very tight schedule by then.
Don't worry. My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule.
That will be fine. When can I see him?
Let's do it this way. I'll take him to your place this Saturday. Then you two can make a schedule.
Make sure you come here before noon. I will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon.
How are you going to get there?
By bus, Of course.
I am sure my friend can give you a ride.
Great. By the way, What does your friend do?
He is a lawyer.
Ok, See you then.
See you.
Do you really?
What do you mean?
Well, I just think he deserves it.
Ok. It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband. She is always expecting to see her husband again. So, Later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon, It is time for the family members to come together.
So, I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day.
You are right. In China, 'round' is an auspicious word. The moon cakes are in round shape.
Is it official?
It was not in the past. But from 2008, We can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival.
Morning. Can I help you?
Yes, I'd like to know how to use the library. You know, I'm a new student here.
All you need is your student identification card to check out books.
Yes. Here's my identification.
That's all you need.
Thank you very much. By the way, How many books am I allowed to check out?
You can check out two books at a time. But you can't check out newspapers, Magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library.
How long can I keep the books?
For two weeks. After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer.
I want a book on physics. Could you show me where I can find it?
Yes, Over there to your left.
I'm sorry. I don't think so.
Why? What's wrong with it?
It's much too hard for his age.
No, Really?
Yes, Flexible, Aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department.
Who will be there?
James is going to be packed off there.
That is good. He can leave you alone this time.
They are my own flesh and blood. It's hard for me to see them suffering.
That's human nature.
Thank you, Paul.
Yes Anthony, Come on in. Have a seat.
Is everything okay? You seem a bit preoccupied.
Well, Anthony, This is not going to be an easy conversation. The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.
Okay...
I don't want to beat around the bush so I'm just gonna come out with it. We are going to have to let you go.
What? Why? I mean... Just like that? I'm fired?
I'm sorry but, To be honest, You are a terrible employee!
What! I resent that!
Anthony, You were caught making international calls from the office phone, You called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol!
No, Have they have another fight?
No, They got engaged.
You must be joking. Those two?
Well, My dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth. David called me this morning.
So when did all this happen?
Last weekend, While they were on the Sik trip.
Well, I believe it now, And when are they are getting married?
Next June.
I can hardly believe it.
Good idea. There is a good nightclub nearby, Isn't it?
Yes, The dance hall is nice with various styles of music.
( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor, They are so crazy.
That's rock and roll with fast tempo.
I like the slow dance. I am good at rumba and waltz.
Take it easy. The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party.
Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage.
Ok, Follow me.
Listen, It is waltz. I like the elegant step of the old styles.
May I?
Sure.
( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully!
No, I assure you.
And you'll repair the television, Won't you?
Ok.
Do you promise?
Of course.
And Tom, You will help Johnny with his homework, Won't you?
I'll see. I will if I can but I won't promise.
But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you?
Yes. But only if you ask me nicely.
Tom, Darling. You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you? Please!
Ok. I'll keep my promise.
He borrowed it from Nick.
He must be mad! Nick is a loan shark.
He was too desperate to find some other way.
But it was her that makes us so embarrassed.
I know. But there's no point in making her feel worse, Isn't there?
I don't care.
No. I'm serious. I'm going to quit my job.
That's amazing! You got a good pay here, Didn't you?
It's true. But I can't show my abilities.
Come on! Don't be silly!
Your present job is something better. Why do you change?
Well. How do you know?
Birds of feather flock together. You must be one of these men.
I know little of her. I only think she's pretty and intelligent. Of course, She's diligent, Too.
That's enough for you to worship the ground she treats on.
It was me. I am so sorry.
What did you think you were doing?
I had to move it, So that I can get my bike through.
How dare you be so inconsiderate? That's wrong.
I am awfully sorry. I didn't think you would mind so much.
Never do that again.
I promise.
Who?
Julia Roberts.
Yeah, She is so charming. I like her, Too.
It's said that her new movie is going to come out.
What's the movie about?
I'm not sure.
Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about?
I already told you, Because Julia Roberts is in it. I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities.
Yeah, She is great. I also admire her for her concern about society.
I wouldn't count on it.
She did last time.
Yes, But I'll bet she won't again.
Sure. All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library.
How many books am I allowed to check out at a time?
Two books at a time. Except magazines or journals, They have to be read within library.
How long can I keep the books?
For one month. If you can't return the books in time, You'll be fined. But if you renew them, You can keep them longer.
I see. Now I want to check out two books on spoken English. Can you show me where I can find them?
Yes, Just over there to your right.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
It was a piece of cake.
Yeah. It is the very latest in digital video cameras.
I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price.
Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity. They come with a lot of inviting functions.
Such as?
They offer clearer and sharper images. Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses, A photo mode and fast-action mode.
They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand.
Right! Anyway, The basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital.
What does this mean?
This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home, Like your digital TV or your computer.
I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing.
Sure! And without any conversion process or loss of quality! You quickly find, Cut, And record video segments and create slide shows. Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects.
What special effects?
Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves.
That's great!
With the development of the broad band Internet, You can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners.
So everybody's getting video mail.
Oh, Just looking at these club notices. I'm thinking of joining one. Hey-why don't we join a club together? How about the Tennis Club?
Actually, I'm not good at tennis at all...
Neither am I. It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club.
Oh, Come on. That's no reason to do something you're not interested in.
Well... What are you interested in?
How about the Classical Music Club?
Joanna, Give me a break.
Hey-how about the Cinema Club?
Sounds OK to me. I like movies. Hey, Joanna, Look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here. And the club jackets - they're really hot! I think we made the right choice!
And it's all coming down to the next three weeks.
The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina.
Yeah, She is some kind of Superwoman, Isn't she?
Failure just isn't an option for her. I'm glad she's on our team.
Actually, I had a perfect plan for this afternoon, But it is totally ruined by the sand storm. I woke up this morning and found it was sunny. So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me. We were going to look for a new purse. Now it turned out to be like this. Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore.
That's too bad. I hate sand storms too. It can be worse than any kind of bad weather.
What's wrong with climate? Anyway, I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before. Can't people do something to stop it?
It is not an easy job. The government is working on it. Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital. Also, Methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought. But of course, It will not work overnight. So, Have you come out with a new plan for today?
My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment.
I would like to return this book.
May I do anything else for you?
I would also like to check out this magazine.
I can't let you do that.
Why is that?
Our policy doesn't allow anyone to check out the magazines.
What things am I allowed to check out?
You are only allowed to check out books or videos.
I really need to check out this magazine.
I'm sorry, But that's our policy.
That's stupid.
What? Are you sure about that?
Yeah, He is going to move next month.
Where is he going?
He is going to Canada and to live with his son.
What a pity!
Why did you say that? It's a good thing for him to live with his son.
I know that. But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour. You know I always appreciate Tom's company.
Me too. But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future.
The same to you!
Are you going anywhere?
I thought about going to my sister's. How about you?
Oh, I'll probably just stay at home.
You mean the one with the yellow bricks? But last time I saw it, It wasn't really in business yet. I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms. Is it open now?
Yes, Someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning. So, Let's have a try. My treat.
Great, I like the idea of trying some new food.
Good for you. Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world.
Also some traditional Chinese food, Like noodles anddumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality. I heard this year, The government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control. For sure all the customers will benefit from this.
Yeah. What's going on?
Not much. What a surprise to see you here.
Yeah. It's been a couple of months since I saw you.
What have you been up to?
I just started working out.
Really? Where do you work out at?
I joined the Samsung Health Club last month.
What do you mostly do during your workout?
I concentrate mostly on my legs, Chest, Arms and stomach.
I should start exercising more.
It's hard work while exercising, But it is a great feeling when I get done.
I have a running machine at home. I used to use it, But I already got sick of it.
Exercising at home is hard. The environment is not suited for exercising.
If I want to exercise, I will need to join a gym.
I have a couple of guest passes. You want to check out my health club?
That's a good idea. Let's go over the weekend.
Great. I'll call you Saturday morning.
Aright. I'll talk to you later.
Ok. Bye.
We have a beautiful natural park.
It's worth the time.
Come on. Let's walk there.
I'm worried about my daughter. She can't decide about college.
Don't worry. That's just a part of being a teenager.
I don't mind that. But she disagrees with me about everything.
You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself. You shouldn't affect her decision.
But I just want to give her some tips.
Oh, She can make her own decisions.
The same to you, Joey.
This is your first Christmas in the US. Here is the gift for you.
It's very thoughtful of you. Wow, It is so beautiful. Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas?
Ok. People decorate their houses, Place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together.
You're right. Let's ask her to give us one more week.
Oh! Good evening. I'm sorry, But she is not in. She's gone out to the theatre.
Oh! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents.
Please come in.
But you're busy, Aren't you?
I was preparing my supper but I've finished now.
I can leave the parcel with you, Can't I?
Oh! Yes.
What?
How come you have a locker but I don't?
Mr. Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you.
I had to carry my backpack with me all day.
Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow.
Does it have a lock?
No. You have to buy your own. You'll have to go to a hardware store to pick one up.
I tried. You were preoccupied.
I got carried away. I made such a fool of myself. They were both laughing at me!
You got drunk, And you were hilarious. Lighten up.
That guy was definitely a Don.
So now you can say you had a mafia experience. Ha-ha.
Yeah. If I leave Little Italy alive...
Are you kidding? Don had fun scaring you. He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back.
That's my grand-father. He was a farmer. When he was young, He had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field.
Oh yes, That was the best job in most farm families. That's where many of them learned to play the flute.
My grandfather did that too. He used the time to study instead.
That's interesting. Go on!
My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business. He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school.
So he became a self-taught man?
Right. Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village. When he was middle aged, He became a great man, Quite famous.
In what field?
As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country.
Is he still in that that type of work.
No. He retired from that. He is a senator now.
Would you want to be a senator?
Well, Maybe when I get old. But first I'll be a lawyer.
Why are you considering trying for it?
I think that I might like it, But I am still thinking about it.
What is it about this job that appeals to you?
I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved.
Yes, You could be right. There is a lot to consider.
I am also wondering about the pay.
Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?
I am thinking that might be the case.
I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change your mind.
Great minds think alike.
Oh, No! Why? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place.
Yeah, I really wanted to come, Too. But something unexpected in shanghai have come up. I have to fly out for a few days, But I'll be back soon.
No problem. Call me when you get back.
I should have some free time next week. Say, Next Wednesday evening?
That's good for me, But do you think you'll be back by then? I'd really like to see you.
Yeah, I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday.
Great! That's settled then.
Ok.
Hackneyed theme!
What? How much do you know Hollywood?
Nearly everything.
You are full of boasts. I can examine you by question and answer. What is Hollywood? Where is it? What is the function of it?
Too easy questions. Listen carefully. Hollywood is the movie capital of the world. It is located in southern California. Many films have been made there, And the kinds have changed often.
Not bad. What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930's.
Gangster movies. Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it.
Mm. What came after that?
After all that violence, People needed to laugh, So from the mid-to-late l940's, Many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made. Then came musicals.
Pretty good. Please continue.
Right. By the mid - 50's, This light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects. There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years, And that was the,Mm, The...
The western films about America's cowboys, Indians and early settlers.
Come on.
Since the early 1960's, There are horror movies about people who encounter frightening, Unnatural situations, And serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened, And science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds. Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have.
Any more?
Of course, No list of film would be complete without animated movies. These are especially popular among children.
Oh! I forgot all about it. Of course you can have it back, John. I'm sorry about the delay.
Well, It doesn't matter. I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming.
Are you in a hurry?
You bet. I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago.
In that case, Here, You go first.
Thanks, Tim. Nice meeting you, Too.
I guess we'll see just around.
Ye, I hope so. Well. Take it easy.
You too.
Are you kidding? I'm terrible! But I love to watch sports. I go to football or baseball games a lot. And I read sports magazines every week.
Wow!
Do you like sports, Janice?
Oh, Yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.
Oh, I see. You know, We spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?
Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, And the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband. I always feel good afterward.
That's great! I'Ve heard people say that before.
Well, Why don't you try to get some exercise? It's difficult, But very rewarding.
Oh, I'm too lazy to play sports, And I'm not good at anything either. It hardly excites me.
I know. He doesn't like to ask anyone for help. My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself!
That sounds like my Grandmother. She was always stubbornly independent.
It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own.
They see their independence as a kind of character strength.
Sometimes they are too independent.
What do you do with it?
For the first drive, Put the golf ball on the tee, And push the tee into the ground.
Okay.
Pick up a wood and hold it like this, Interlocking your fingers.
Ok.
Position yourself, Swinging the club, Watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can.
Hey!
Not too bad. The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible.
Got it.
No, Nobody.
You don't mind if I smoke, Do you?
Well, To be frank, Yes, I do.
Oh, I'm sorry. But this isn't a no-smoker, Is it? I mean would you mind if I smoke here?
Actually it is. Perhaps you haven't noticed the sign.
Sign? What's sign?
There, On the window.
Oh, Sorry. I didn't notice it. Sorry.
That's all right.
No, Not usually. Most people are married in a church, And then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception. Sometimes, However, They hold the reception in a big room in the church.
Where do they go?
Either they go to a public place such as a hotel, A restaurant, Or a club, Or to the home of the brid.
They go to the home of the bride?
Why do you ask?
The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite.
Oh! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement, Costs, Etc. So the reception is held at her home.
That's very expensive for the family of the bride.
Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding.
Tell me something about the bridal bouquet. Isn't it the custom to throw it?
Yes. When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place. The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it. The one who does will be the next one married.
Maybe I'll be the one.
What?
The boss is planning to sell the company.
You must be joking!
Give me a break. You don't care about the colors. You just like the hot babe on the cover.
Ok, You got me. So, Do you have a subscription?
Of course. I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines.
So what do you do with all the out-dated issues?
I guess I'm lending them to you...
Where to?
Hold on! I can't afford to pay for both.
Don't worry. I've got money. It's my treat.
Gee, That's really nice of you.
Hi, Debbie. Have a seat. How's it going?
I'm OK. How are you doing?
Pretty good. Listen... Have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue?
Do you mean The Bangkok?
That's the one. A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night. How about coming with us?
Sure, I'd love to.
Great. I'll call and make reservations.
Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me. Oh! I'm late! I have a class.
All right. I'll call you tonight and tell you the time.
Great. Talk to you then.
Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind?
I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home.
That sounds great. Is it casual?
Actually, We thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays.
That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.
Yes, We've invited four other couples, So it should be a good mix of people.
That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?
Oh yes, Everyone we are inviting is from our company.
Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation.
I don't know. But he must be a big shot.
Why?
Because everyone is trying to butter him up.
The cat has eaten my fish, I'll kill it.
But supposing your son killed like the fish, What do you think then?
I'll beat him.
So beat the cat, But don't kill it.
Yes, He had just bought a new motorcycle.
Did he let you ride it?
Yes, I tried it and I quite liked it.
Weren't you frightened?
Sure. But I still liked it.
Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself?
No. Although motorcycle is nice, I'd like to buy a bicycle.
But why? Since you like it so much.
Because bicycles are safer.
Really? That's marvelous!
And then you're old man won't be beaten this time.
I'Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again.
It's an excellent one. I like it very much.
Why?
It includes a lot of useful words and phrases.
I agree with you.
Do you have your book list for your class?
Yes, I have my list.
Fine. Once you have it, You can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that is?
Yes, I know where the bookstore is.
Ok, So once you pass the gym, It's the first door on your left. Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there?
No, I didn't know I could do that.
You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be going there today?
Yes, I am going today.
Well, If you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1.
Yes, Thank you. That would be great.
Well, Then, I'll talk to you later. Have a good day!
Sorry to trouble you. But I don't think this fish is fresh. It actually tastes a bit off.
Sorry, Miss. I'll place it immediately, Can I get you another drink, Or you wait?
No, Please don't do that. I'd just like to return it.
I'm sorry, Miss, But I'm afraid we can't do that. You'll order something else instead. I'd love to suggest the steak, It's the special today, And quite tasty.
Ok, Then please bring me the steak mediun-rare, Thank you.
Ok, Miss. I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner.
What's wrong? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack.
Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything! I'm such a bad son!
Take it easy! Let's go to the mall, Window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like.
That's just it! I don't know what to get her! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small! I suck at getting presents for people.
That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess peoples' likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like!
Yeah, You're right. When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.
Yeah, Tell me about it. I know! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, Right? Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod.
Now that's a great idea!
Yes. I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up.
Shadow-boxing? How interesting! Do you think it really helpful for your health?
Definitely. It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul.
Yes, He once gave her seven roses.
Did she accept it?
No way to know.
How about Great Canyon?
Is it worth seeing?
Of course! It's the most wonderful natural works.
Are they coming to Chicago again?
Yes. They're coming the beginning of August.
Oh, Good! We can all get together again.
I'm glad they're coming in August. Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game.
And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park.
Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England?
Oh, Yes. We all sat on the grass, And Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs.
I had a great time. It'll be good to see them again.
Yes. By the way, You are having a great make-up today. I like the color of your lipstick. So adorable!
Really? It took me really a while to find the color. I am happy you like it.
Well, Girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things. Actually, Do we still have a meeting this afternoon?
Sure, When those never ending meetings.
How old is he?
Twelve. He's very sensible for his age.
I bet my button dollar that he won't. He is no more than a nine day's wonder.
What is your idea?
Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear.
Oh, Yes. I got so tired. My son began to cry the moment we got on the train. It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep.
Didn't you bring his favorite toy?
Yes, We did. Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag, And finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms.
Where did you go? You've got a beautiful tan.
My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks, So we compromised and finally went to the seaside. I think vacation in summer is not good.
You must have had a great time. Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming.
Yes, He was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten.
His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir.
And I taught him how to swim in the sea. It was fun and made him braver than before. After we returned home, He wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom.
You do?
Look, Maybe I shouldn't tell you this, But I'v going over to WebTracker, Too.
No way! That's great! Then we'll still be together!
Actually, I'm already working for WebTracker. Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth, So I figured, What the heck.
No kidding! I can't believe this. You devil!
It's kind of cool, Isn't it? I'm sort of like a secret agent.
Well, Most of the time it is, I guess.
What do you think will make you happy?
I think money will make me happy.
You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness.
It will for me. Then I can do all the things I want to do.
You'll get bored eventually.
Then I can find something new to do. If I don't have to worry about money, Then I don't have to work.
That's true, I guess. If I didn't have to work, I think I would be happy.
You see... Money doesn't equal happiness, But it takes away a lot of responsibilities.
Sure, I have. Will you join?
I will. You know, As a newcomer, I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere.
You are right. Our company's Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking.
I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.
No, It will not be formal at all. It is a fun time. You will love the game show. Please dress casually. Usually there is an over abandon of drinks, So be careful with that.
Don't worry, I can handle that. And I know if the boss is there, Even it is an informal evening, It does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him.
You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you.
Not often. Just when I make mistakes.
We have been on good terms. She is a very nice girl. But she got in Dutch with her boss. I don't have the heart to see her pounding the pavements.
You must be stuck on her, Or you would not use your elbow grease.
Well, We hit it off with each other. Nothing more, Nothing much.
It it true of many countries.
You know why?
Sure. If people are near in blood, They might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation.
Hi, An. How are you?
I am fine. I am going swimming this afternoon. Are you coming with me?
I am afraid I can't this afternoon. I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons.
Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together.
Ok, I'll meet you at the club at two thirty.
Yes, Why?
Well, I came to know a girl three weeks ago. We have so much in common.
So?
So I think I may fall in love with her.
That sounds great. But how do you know that's a crush or a real love?
Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love?
That's a big question. Well, If you're in love, Maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all.
That's what I do.
And you think about her all the time?
Yes.
And maybe you suddenly have new interests. I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid. For instance, You used to sleep in every morning, But because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging.
That's it. She likes dogs so much now, And I begin to love dogs.
Oh, Congratulations. Sounds like you've found your soul mate.
Thanks, But I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another.
Yes, That's right. If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her, Then you can stay in love.
Yeah, Falling in love is so good.
I just bought a new atlas. I'm looking this map of the world. Look at Russia! That's a vast country.
Canada, China, And the USA are huge too.
There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.
Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, But compared to many countries in other continents, It's not very large at all.
Britain is half the size of france, But great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world.
The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used. Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest.
Well, That's hard to say because there are so many good ones. I don't think I could pick a favorite.
You know what comedy I really like? "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective." I think Jim Carry is really funny.
Oh yeah, That's one of my favorite flicks. I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever.
I agree. But even though I like comedies, I usually prefer more serious films. My favorite movie is "Titanic.".
It doesn't matter to me.
Does 7 o'clock suit you?
Either way. I don't care.
How about a snack after work?
I couldn't careless.
Would you rather stay home?
Whatever you say.
Are you really interested in doing something?
I don't mind if you want to.
Do you have enough money to buy that dress?
No. I need to borrow $ 50.
Sure, Here you go.
Yes, I do. I am the oldest child. I have a sister and a brother. My sister is in college and my brother in high school.
How do you get along with them?
We get alone very well.
Rather difficult. How about you?
It wasn't too bad. Were you nervous?
Rather. I'm afraid I didn't do very well.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
That's because you did well.
No, I wouldn't worry about you.
Why?
It seems to me that you always do better than you say.
What a great idea!
January would be a good month for a mountain retreat.
I like the mountain idea, But I am not so sure about the month of January.
You know, Now that I think about it, You might be right.
April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements.
That is a good suggestion.
We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.
Yeah, That would let us know what would work best.
I'll put the survey online this afternoon.
Silly, You should make sure he does.
Uh-huh. How about you?
He's buying me a handbag, And then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant.
You got a big return for a small gift.
Wow that's great news! They're a great couple!
I know! Anyways I just talked to Alex's best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It's gonna be so much fun! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night.
You aren't going to a strip club, Are you? I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friends party.
Aw come on! It's just some innocent fun! You know how these things are! We are gonna play drinking games, Get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.
Well, I don't know.
Come on! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party!
Good, Because my friend Wendy is getting married and I'm organizing her party!
What!
Oh, It's Death on the Nile. Have you read it?
No, Not that one. But I saw the movie. Could I borrow it when you finished?
Sure. I didn't know you like mysteries.
Oh, I'm crazy about them.
Oh, Darling, We must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music. I know you can pull yourself together.
I feel life is meaningless without him.
Cheer up. You have got me at least.
No. What did it say?
There's a garage sale around the corner.
A garage sale... That's where people check out cars, Right?
What? Cars? Are you serious?
I'm pulling your leg, Paul. I'm a shopping queen, Remember? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about!
How many different varieties of products do you import from China?
China provides the bulk of our product inventory, For sure. We import more than 40 different items from China. Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys. Japan produces many electronic exports, Germany produces excellent mechanical exports.
Do you import any food items?
Generally speaking, Food items are difficult to import. Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another. The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods. The shelf life is longer for these products.
No idea. We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights. What else is there to see?
What about a factory tour?
You mean visit a factory?
Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry.
Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee?
I'm not sure, But as far as I know, Most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour.
Really? What do the companies do that for?
I believe most of them think it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known.
Oh, IsEE. So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors.
Exactly.
Do we need an appointment beforehand?
I'll call the tourist information centre to check.
Thanks.
Do you need a hand with that?
Actually, I could you some help. Thank you so much.
Don't worry about it.
Yes.
When will school start?
It'll start on lst September.
What a shame!
I fell down and hurt my arm.
That's too bad.
Then my son drove into a tree.
I am sorry to hear that.
The dog bit the delivery boy.
What a pity!
And a storm blew our roof away.
Ho, No!
Good evening, Mr. Smith.
Have you met my wife, Mary?
No. I haven't had the pleasure.
Mary, This is Mr. Wu, My new Chinese friend.
How do you do, Mr. Wu? Welcome.
How do you do?
Have a glass of wine, Mr. Wu? And let me introduce you to some of my guests.
How beautiful the detached house is!
Follow me to the back-yard.
It's marvelous! The lawn looks like a green carpet, And the garden with so many lovely flowers.
We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning.
No wonder it smells fragrant.
Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later.
It's fantastic!
Yep. And it breathes, See!
It's not breathing!
Yes, It is. Look at the little light! It blinks off and on.
Jen, It's not alive... But it does look user-friendly.
I would look so cool carrying this around!
And you'd look so cool!
Yes, I am studying in Eastern Asian language department.
What are you majoring in?
I major in Japanese.
What do you think of the literature course?
It's very helpful. The course has let me into a new world of literature. I read so many great literatures.
Maybe they are still wet behind ears.
They are blind with bucks. Blind people are more easily conned, Fo course.
Sure. Many people, Including men and women, And be easily ripped off.
( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying.
Uh, To begin with, Please take a look at the syllabus in front of you. As you all should know by now, This class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50.
That's terrible. He speaks too fast. How can I catch his meaning?
Again, As you see on your course outline, Grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test, Periodic quizzes, And classroom participation.
I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not.
I heard that too. She must be making a pocket. Well, Good for her.
Now, She'll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states.
Yes, She will. At the moment, The exchange rate is very favorable, So she should try to go as soon as possible, While it's cheaper.
You're right. By the way, Did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently?
Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago.
They did. He inherited the money from an uncle. I hope he doesn't lose a lot of it in taxed to the government.
Dying can be very expensive nowadays! What's he going to do with it?
He said that he would probably invest most of it. He's got a well-paid job, So he doesn't need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires.
I had some good financial news yesterday too.
Really? Have you won a fortune in the lottery?
No, But I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I'Ve put in recently. I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way.
It certainly was! So, What are you going to do with your windfall?
I know them. They are the two brothers living next door.
Brothers? Do you know why they quarreled?
It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers.
Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute?
No, Everyone keeps in mind that 'Don't intrude in a family dispute'..
Why? We just got here.
I know, But it's 12.
12.
Three or four o'clock?
Yes.
I never stay out that late. That's too late.
But why is it too late? It's Saturday night. You have nothing to do tomorrow. Why not stay out and drink with us?
Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei, Sharon?
Yes, I was. And I like living here. People know how to party here. In Taipei, Some people know how to party. But here, Everyone does.
What is that they're doing on the couch?
They're smoking pot. Don't worry about it.
Pot? Isn't that marijuana?
Yes, It is.
But, Sharon, That's illegal! The police could come, And we could go to jail.
Don't worry about it. It is true that pot is illegal in America. But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan. If people are arrested, And they have a little pot in their possession, They don't go to jail. They just have to pay a fine.
Really?
Yes.
I didn't know you had such wild friends. Do you smoke marijuana too?
I tried it a couple times. But I don't like it. I like alcohol better. Don't worry about them, Though. If you don't want to smoke pot, You don't have to.
I don't want to.
That's alright. But you really should have another drink. People will probably start dancing soon.
I don't know if I can drink more. I already had two drinks.
You had two drinks at nine o'clock. C'mon, Ann, You are in an American university now! You have to learn how to drink.
I thought a university was for studying.
It is. We study hard all week. And then, On the weekend, We party hard. That's the best way to live.
Alright. I'll have another drink.
Well, Things are all right.
I heard you got a new roommate. What's he like?
Yeah, Bob moved in last week. He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend.
Oh? What's wrong with his girlfriend?
She came over last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out. I tried to smile and be polite, But the whole time all I could think was "what's wrong with your voice?"..
Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to.
I doubt it. Last time was an oral train wreck. Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil.
Oh come on, It's not that bad.
No, It's so much worse. And tonight they invited me out to dinner. I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off.
Rough. Maybe you can do the most of the talking.
That's the plan.
Good luck.
I am not cheating. When you pass go, You collect $ 200, Everyone knows that!
Well you can't just take the money. You have to ask the bank for money. And I'm the banker.
Banker?
Yes...
Can I have my $ 200 please?
Sure. Here you are, $ 200, Thank you, Please come again! Now it's my turn to roll the dice.
Yes, Is that you, Allen?
Yes, How are you doing?
Not bad.
Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening. Would you like to come with me?
Sure. Thank you very much.
Then I'll pick you up at six thirty. Ok?
Ok, See you.
See you.
It is hard to guess now. Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time. I guess the game will end in a tie. They are equally matched.
I am so nervous now. What a terrific game!
Which side are you on?
It's hard to say, Because each team has my idols.
Wow! Ac wins. It is a close shave, You know.
I will never forget this match. The angle is so terrible and so correct.
What a good goal!
Yeah, So what do you think about the teachers?
To be honest, I like all of them, Except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, He seems like an old person. He's so boring.
I think so too. I don't like him either. Well, Who do you like best?
It might be the English teacher. What about you?
Me, Too. She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her.
She is a pretty good teacher! With her help I think I can make great progress in English.
Yeah, I like her way of teaching. She told us not to cram for exams, And to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing.
I think it's a good way to develop our language ability.
Actually, Our new math teacher is a good person. He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us.
I'm sorry.
It isn't your fault. No one will blame you.
You are so thoughtful.
What about the Yellowstone National Park?
Have you ever been there?
Yes. The scenery is so breathtaking.
What is especially impressive?
There are thousands of hot springs and fountains. The park is known for them.
Is there a waterfall?
Yes. The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon.
What an attractive place! How can I get there?
You can take No. 2 bus.
What is that?
A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!
Cool!
Ok, Each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, You set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, It can move one space diagonally.
What about all these other pieces?
See this one that looks like a tower? It's called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, It's a very important piece so it's best to not let your opponent capture it.
And these two? They are husband and wife?
That's right! That's the queen and that's the king. If the other player captures your king, He will say Check Mate and the game is over! Doesn't this sound fun?
Nah! This is boring! I'm gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!
Fine, Thanks.
Are you sure you're alright. You look a bit worry today? Is anything wrong?
Well, Yes. There are something wrong actually. Perhaps you can give me some advice.
Of course if I can.
Well, Last night when I returned from thetheatre I found I lost my wallet.
Oh dear. That's terrible. What was in your wallet?
Well, Some money of course, A vise, All my identity cards and some photos.
Well, If I were you, I would go to the police station straight away and calling.
Yes, I have already done that and they already look for it. I'll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly.
Oh dear. What a pity. Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre?
Yes, Quite sure.
I think you should put an advertisement in china daily. Things where you lasted.
But that takes too long.
Wait a minute, My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre. I'Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it. We'd better have breakfast now. And meet him later.
Yeah it's too bad... But actually I think I know what to do.
What's that?
We can go to a horror movie, And I'll hold your hand so you don't get scared.
You mean... Like on a second date?
Of course! Or are you still too scared!
No way! That sounds great!
Thanks, Tim. Nice meeting you, Too.
I guess we'll see each other around.
Yeah, I hope so. Well, Take it easy.
You too.
He's in the hospital resting. The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet.
I'm so sorry to hear that. But this is a good hospital. I'm sure they will do whatever they can.
I hope so.
You must feel really worried right now. But you know your dad is a fighter.
Yeah. I think my mom is the most worried. I'm basically worried about how she is doing.
Where is she right now?
She's in the hospital with my dad. I have to go back tonight.
Hey, I'll go with you.
You don't have to.
It's really no problem.
Ok. Let's go right after dinner.
Well, Black is a better color than pink. Pink's for girls.
Then why are you wearing black shoes?
Because... Oh, All right. You win. Let's pay for them and go.
Hey, Thanks, Mum.
Uh-oh. It'll probably cost a lot to fix it.
I'll make it up to you. Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money.
Well, My sister is a lawyer.
Really? Does she live here in Seattle?
Yes, She does. But she's working in Washington,D. C., Right now. Her job is top secret.
Wow!! And what does your brother do?
He's a painter. He's working in Argentina this month. He has an exhibition there.
What an interesting family!
I'm out of work at the moment.
Why?
I was fired last week.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It doesn't matter.
What's your plan now?
After the tour I'll have a rest. And then go to find a new job.
Best wishes for you.
Thank you.
I have a severe headache now.
Please go to see a doctor.
Would you like to go with me? I'm afraid of the hospital.
You're kidding!
It's true. He is a hard worker.
I know he really deserves this.
Oh I fell over on the way to work.
Oh I see. So that's why you didn't come in?
Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn't call you.
Oh dear, That sounds terrible.
It was! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt.
Oh dear. Well, Get well soon and try to be more careful in future.
Ok. Shall we go to a bar?
Good idea. I like hanging out in bars at night.
Why?
For killing time and making new friends.
Don't you think it's too noisy here? The rock music! I can hardly bear it.
Calm down! My little guy! You'll get used to that after you come here several times.
Well, I'll try. Then what would you like to drink? It's on me.
I'd like a gin and tonic.
What happened with that guy at the cafe?
Nothing.
But you're crazy about him.
Yes, I am.
Why don't you run off with him? What are you waiting for?
I don't actually know him.
Really?
I only know him through the... You are not gonna believe this.
Oh, Let me guess. Through the internet?
Yes.
Hmm. 'You'Ve got mail. '..
Thanks. Miss Zhang.
You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave.
Really? I've already opened this one. Say, This is sweet, And it's just what I need to go with my new suit. Thank you ever so much.
Sure, Do you think you could live out here? You know, Back to nature at all?
I don't know. I don't mind coming out here for a while, But that will get old pretty soon.
That's what I was thinking. I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you'd have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels.
I think I'd go lonely if I do like that.
And where would you get a cup of cappuccino?
Now that would be hard to live without. We city folks are pretty spoiled.
Maybe. But I ‘d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds.
Come on, Brenda! Never say die.
Oh yes, I'Ve been to Britain many times. I go there on business.
Really? How often do you go there?
Usually, I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year.
Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday?
I'm afraid I never go for a holiday. It's always business.
Have you found a suitable job?
No. But it is said the welfare in Canada is very good.
But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing.
Maybe you are right, So I will try my best to find a suitable job.
Ok. When?
At 10 o'clock.
10 in the morning?
No, At night.
Sorry, That's too late. I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM.
Ok, How about 1:30 PM?
No, That's too early. I'll still be at work then.
How about 5:00 PM?
That's fine.
Ok, See you then.
Alright. Bye.
Yes I have. I'Ve been there three times in the past year.
That sounds great. Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower?
No I haven't. I haven't visited the Bund either. I'Ve always had too much work to do.
So you haven't done much then, In Shanghai?
Actually, I'Ve eaten soupdumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu. They were delicious!
Oh, Yes. I really like it here.
Would you like to do something tonight?
Sure. I'd love to.
Let's see. Have you been to a jazz club yet?
Yes. I've already been to several clubs here.
Ok. What about an evening riverboat tour?
Uh, Actually, I've gone twice this week.
So, What do you want to do?
Well, I haven't been to the theater in a long time.
Oh, Ok. I hear there's a terrific show at theSanger Theater.
Great! Let's make a reservation.
I love just about anything by Prince.
So, You're into 80s music then?
Well, I like all kinds of music, But he is one of my favorites. How about you?
I like alternative music.
Do you have a favorite band?
To be honest, No. I'm always in search of new music to listen to.
Do you often go to concerts?
I usually go to see a live band about twice a month. What about you?
I love going to live gigs. Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend?
There's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays. You should come along next week with me.
I'd love to, But I have a night class on Thursdays.
That's too bad. Maybe another time.
Let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends. I have more free time then.
I'll let you know. Did you want to watch some TV?
Sure, What's on?
There's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight.
That sounds dreadful!
What do you mean?
I want a different hair style.
What style do you want?
Can you make my hair short?
Exactly how short do you want it?
Make it a few inches long.
Are you sure you want me to cut it that short?
I've been thinking about this for a while now.
Okay. I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want.
I honestly want my hair that short.
All right, Then let's begin.
The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized. The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products.
I see.
If you need any further information, Please don't hesitate to ask me.
Ok, I will.
Pretty good. I'Ve just had my new poems published.
Congratulations on your success.
Thank you.
And how's your brother?
He is fine.
He's going to be sent to Britain to study, Really?
Yes. He's already got the passport and visa.
Fantastic! Please send him my congratulations.
Thank you. He's very lucky indeed.
About 3 years, So I came here 2000.
So, Where did you grow up?
Providence, Rhode Island. Do you know it?
I am not sure, Where exactly is it?
Well, Not so far from New York. So what about you? Did you grow up here?
No, I was born in Gaoxiong, I only moved to Taipei after I graduated.
Look at me. I look so old! I look as if I were thirty.
Come on! Stop being so vain. You look great! You are beautiful!
Yes, I am, But I think it's time for some plastic surgery I'm tired of these wrinkles andsagging skin. See?
I don't see any wrinkles orsagging skin! You are stop beings ridiculous. Besides, I think that people who get Boto, Have facelifts, Or tummytucks look weird. It doesn't look natural.
Whatever, I think I'm gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.
I think you need to get brain surgery. I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery. You look amazing.
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.
You don't need plastic surgery to do that. You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you! Plus, Plastic surgery hurts!
Really?
Yeah! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week!
I'm sorry, My watch has stopped.
It's 2:42 by my watch. But it moves a bit fast.
Let's ask someone else.
Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars?
Okay. One-hundred then. Do you think I will lose it?
I don't know. You have to be smart, But you have to be lucky too. Some games are all luck. With some, You need to be smart.
I want games that are all luck.
I knew you would say that! Then you should play the slot machines.
Slot machines? No, I don't want that! That's too boring. I want a game with cards or dice.
So what do you want to play then?
Blackjack. We can play blackjack. And I will gamble one-hundred, Or maybe two-hundred dollars.
Huh? You are breaking our rule already! And we didn't even start to play yet!
Oh, Don't be so strict! We are in Las Vegas.
Yes, And if I stay with you, We will have to walk back home to New York. Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too!
You're kidding!
Goofed off? Maybe, But I'm not a clock-watcher. I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier.
You'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out. He may probably give you the bag.
I'm sure of what I'm doing.
Yes. You've done a good job. But there's one thing. You should narrow down your topic.
What about water pollution instead of pollution?
Well done!
Yeah, I know, But it's too hard to do.
Our eyes should look into the future. We could not live in the past.
Only sometimes when I think about it, I feel very sad.
It's normal. Time will change everything.
I don't think I share your view there. The writer is writing about history, Society, Human nature and so on. It's too hard to understand.
Are you kidding? I'm terrible! But I love to watch sports. I go to football or baseball games a lot. And I read sports magazines every week.
Wow!
Do you like sports, Janice?
Oh, Yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.
Oh, I see. You know, We spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?
Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, And the other days I play badminton with my husband. I always feel good afterward.
That's great! I'Ve heard people say that before.
Well, Why don't you try to get some exercise? It's difficult, But very rewarding.
Oh, I'm too lazy to play sports, And I'm not good at anything either. It hardly excites me.
I see. But Jane. He's not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life.
The early bird catches the worm.
I would like to use the copy machine.
The machine is over there.
Do I have to pay to use the machine?
Yes, You will have to pay to use it.
How much?
It costs ten cents a copy.
Am I limited to a certain number of copies?
You can copy as much as you'd like.
Could you show me how to use the copier?
The instructions for the copier are posted on it.
That's fabulous. Thank you.
What a surprise! This is the best present I've ever received.
Thank you for your love and care over the years. I love you so much.
I love you, Too.
How about a dinner tonight? My treat.
Actually, I prefer to eat at home, And then we'll have more time to have a chat.
All right. Let me prepare the supper.
Her acting is OK.
I mean her personality.
I'm afraid I know less than you do. Tell me more about her, Will you?
It's hot.
I really don't think this weather will last.
Let's just hope it doesn't get hotter.
Yes, It's beautiful weather we're having.
We can't complain about the weather recently.
Yes, The sun shines day after day. It's neither too hot nor too cold.
I wonder how long this weather can last.
I hope it will stay fine tomorrow. I'm going to have a picnic with my family.
Yes, I do. But my characters are very bad.
It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing.
Are you Chinese?
Yes, I am. I am from Taiwan. I came here to study political science.
How do you like it?
I like it so far. But my English still needs work.
I want to study Mandarin and international relations.
Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters?
They teach regular characters.
I see. I'm from Taiwan, So I know regular characters better than simplified.
You just said your English needs work, Yes?
Yes, That's true. Especially my writing. I think my papers aren't good enough. I make too many grammatical mistakes.
Well, I am very serious about learning Chinese. But for me the hard part now is pronunciation. You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, If you have time, Maybe we could do a language exchange.
You mean you and I?
Yes, Why not? I mean, If you come to this cafe often, Maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English.
That sounds like a good idea. How often would you like to do it?
Let's see... My schedule right now is quite busy. But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange.
How would we manage it though? How would we spend the 90 minutes?
First, We could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing. If you want, I could help you edit your papers. Or we could do English conversation. Whatever you want. And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese.
Would I help you with writing?
No. For me right now, The important thing is spoken Chinese. I need practice. So you could tutor me in speaking. We could use my textbook, And you could ask me questions. Then you could correct my mistakes.
I think it sounds like a good system. But when is it convenient to meet?
Well, Today is Monday. Actually, For me Monday at this time would be the best. I am free from now until 11.
Me too. In fact, I'm free until 1.
So if you want to meet at 10.
It sounds good. I will bring the papers I'm working on.
And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder. I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own.
Let me give you my phone number.
Sure. I'll give you mine too. Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason.
Sure.
First of all, I want you to know that I really like working for this company. Do you think I'm doing a good job here?
Well, You are a very hard-worker.
I try very hard. The problem is, My salary just isn't enough to live on. Now that I have a wife and a child to support, We hardly have enough money for food and rent.
There are trying times for everyone. What do you propose?
I could really use a 5 % rise.
That's quite a bit. If I give you a raise, I'm going to have to give everyone a raise.
Listen, If you give me a raise, I'll take on extra responsibilities.
That sounds reasonable. How about this, From now on, You can be responsible for scheduling. That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift, Then you'll have to do it.
That's fine. Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work?
Of course. It's be against the law if we didn't.
That sounds good to me. I really appreciate it.
You are welcome. Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling.
Oh, It's nothing to speak of.
No, Seriously. I'm impressed.
Thank you. I appreciate the compliment.
Well, Of course I can't miss it. Which team are you for?
Manchester United. What about you?
Me too. Do you think they are going to get the championship this time?
I have confidence in them.
We may go abroad, My wife wants to go to Egypt, And I'd like to go there too. We haven't made up our mind yet.
Will you travel by sea or by air?
We may travel by sea. It's cheaper.
I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves.
Really? How do you get the chance?
You know. I took part in the Chinese contest. I was the best and they gave me this reward. I don't have to pay for my trip.
Congratulations. How lucky you are!
Thank you. I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
I'm sure you'll enjoy the trip. China is such a beautiful country.
I'm sure I will.
Have a nice journey, Lily.
Thank you, David.
Thank you. I couldn't have done it without the help of a strong team.
The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done. I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client.
Well, I hope the client feels the same way!
I am sure they will be pleased.
I think it is easy. I could work in your class with no problem.
You thing so?
Oh, Without doubt. When is the next class?
Tomorrow morning. Try it.
No problem.
Are you going to this class this morning?
Of course, Easy. No sweat.
You're no able to move after this class.
Are you kidding me? It's going to be up a piece of cake.
You want to bet?
Yeah, What't the bet?
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing.
Thank you.
Here is a gift for you. I hope you like it.
What a lovely dog! How did you know I love things like this?
I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.
Maybe you won't believe this, But it was made by my grandmother.
Really? It looks so nice.
Thank you, Please have a cup of tea.
All right.
How about some fish?
No, Thanks. I've had enough. Now, Mary, Before you blow out the birthday candles, You have to make a wish. After that, You may cut the cake.
Ok. Let me make a wish... Do you want a big piece of cake?
No, Just a small one. Next Let's sing "Happy Birthday" to Mary.
It is so very kind of you. I'm so moved by you.
Actually, I prefer if you didn't. Air conditioning makes me sneeze.
All right. I'm opening the window, Though, Is that OK?
Oh, Sure. It's very stuffy in here.
This is the result of women's liberation.
Now, Many people think that women's liberation is a kind of civilization, But children are getting less love from their mother because of that. What is your opinion?
I have no idea.
I'm glad I could help.
Here's the check. I included a little extra for you.
You didn't have to do that!
I know, But you deserve it.
Because we are partners in our science lab. Why are you so jealous?
The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek. How do you explain that?
My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek.
Are you sure?
Of course I am. I only love you, Amy.
Okay, I'm sorry. I believe you.
Why do you always accuse me like that?
Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much! I guess I just go crazy sometimes. That's all.
Oh, Amy. I am the luckiest guy in the world.
Why?
Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world!
Oh. Graham. I love you so much and I really believe in our love.
Nothing much. I'm going to the cinema on Friday night but that's all I have planned.
So you're free on Saturday night?
That's right.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
Oh, That would be lovely. Shall we say seven o 'clock?
Perfect. I'll pick you up then.
Hey, That was quite the presentation! Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline. I've gotta say, Alex, You really wowed me today.
Aw, Come on, It was nothing. I'm just doing my job.
No, I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean, If I look back on your previous presentations, This is a huge improvement.
Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on PowerPoint.
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions.
Yeah, Well, That was some good advice. You made some really good points.
Well, I just wanted to say well done. Really you did a great job.
What?
Hey! Man, Put your earphone out. I said which song you are listening to.
Jay Chou's title song in his new album.
What's your comment on his new album?
Gorgeous! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles. I am crazy for it, So I hear it over and again. And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile.
Let me enjoy it.
I suppose this song can be the No. 1 on the top chart.
I cann't wait for buying his CD now.
Yeah. Look, Other kids are coming this way.
But it doesn't look like a real bus stop.
That's because regular buses don't stop here.
How much is it going to cost?
Nothing. It's free.
Is that yellow bus it?
Let's go sit in the back. All the cool kids do.
He has lost his job, And his wife died from cancer not long before.
Poor guy! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet.
We all know that. Her husband always make a fuss of her.
Lucky her.
No.
Do you speak English?
A little, But not very well.
How long have you been here?
2 months.
What do you do for work?
I'm a student. How about you?
I'm a student too.
Do you have the receipt with you?
Yes, Here you are.
Thank you. Do you want your money back?
No, Can I exchange it for a bigger one?
I am afraid this is the biggest size we have.
Oh, That's too bad.
Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern. The price is the same and it's bigger.
That movie's just a lot of noise, Same as Simon.
Oh, What happened, Carole?
I had to go by myself, He couldn't make it.
What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, He said he was coming.
Kitty's? He sure gets around, Doesn't he?
Looks like it. So how did he handle it to?
His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again.
I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.
I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy.
Doesn't sound promising.
Well, I think it's the time to pull the plug.
If you want I'll let him know if I run into him.
Thanks anyway, But I'll do it, Rebecca. Let's get the class.
Yeah, It's been ages! So how have you been?
Couldn't be better. And you?
Just as usual, You know.
Well, Thanksgiving is family event. So on Thanksgiving, Family members will get together and enjoy a big Thanksgiving dinner. Kids will have lot of fun.
Do you say prayers before dinner?
Yes, We do. It is an exciting moment.
What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving?
For me? The football games of course, I love football games.
Just get out of my face, Would you?
Chill out! What's eating you, Anyway?
Sorry. I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape. I like totally drew a blank on everything!
Well, Now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it... What's-her-face... The one who always kisses up to the teacher.
Jennifer Davies? Give me a break! I can't stand her. She's such adweeb! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time?
She's the teacher's pet, That's why. Besides, He's so laid back he lets her get away with it. She just really rubs me the wrong way. And you know what? I think she's got the hots for him, Too.
Get out of here!
I'm dead serious. Yesterday, Before class starts, She walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes, � Good morning, Jim. '..
Oh, Gag me! She's totally gross!
No, It's the Japanese team.
Japanese teams always play a dark horse.
Well, Their team work is well worth learning.
Yes. Work starts at eight and I arrive home after six.
So you have to work all day.
I can take a break at lunch time, But it is only 30 minutes.
I see you sometimes work on weekends, Too.
Yes, I really don't like it.
Well, Last night I had a big argument with Ann.
Terrible. It must be something serious. You two are such close friends.
Now that I look back at it, It wawsn't that big a deal. I shouldn't have lost my temper.
Really? What happened?
It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, And we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, Said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee.
That's pretty harsh.
I know, But I was so upset. I mean, Come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says?
You know she probably feels just as bad.
Well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often.
Well, In that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want.
Yeah, I'll call her later to patch things up.
Say what you want to say.
You see. The wage is not paid yet, I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money.
I am sorry. But I do not have any money to lend to you.
Well, Thank you.
What do you recommend? What can I do to lose weight?
Well, I exercise a lot. I go running at least three times a week. But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained.
Yeah, Well, Actually, One of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot.
Do ya?
Yeah, So maybe it's my diet.
It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat. Maybe, I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between. No potato chips. No popcorn. No candy bars.
That's pretty tough!
I don't know about that.
Yes. I found a very good job down here.
Well, We'll certainly miss you here.
I am going to miss you, Too.
Let's keep in touch.
Ok. I will write to you as soon as I get there.
The days are getting longer!
May and Daniel often like this kind of weather.
Yeah, They can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot.
Honey, How about taking them to the beach this weekend?
That's great!
Since last time we've climbed the mountain, We haven't gone out for a long time.
And this kind of weather is rare for the season either.
Yes, I remember last year this time, The weather is so hot.
So we must seize this chance to go the beach.
Daniel loves the beach very much!
He will enjoy himself this weekend.
I saw him last week. It seems he was a bit queer in the head.
Yes, He has been like that since his accident.
What a pity!
I have to run to the grocery store.
Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends?
Yes, But I am out of food and milk.
What store do you shop at?
The small one, Just down the street. I like their generic brand.
I have been using the store across town for years.
I hear they have very nice stuff.
They do, But they're a little expensive on certain items.
Well, You should try my store. The prices are good.
I will sometime. Thanks for the advice.
Me too.
We should do this more often.
Okay, I'll give you a ring next week.
That's a relief for me and a misery for the children.
Why don't you make up with John.
It's too late.
My parents called. As usual, They reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s. Easier set than done. Who should I marry? I have no time to go on a date.
It is not your mother finding one for you?
I will find one myself, Of course. I'm a modern girl.
Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, The latest type.
You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea.
No, There is an updated version, Three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, You can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes.
I don't think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time.
I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, So-called love at first sight.
Anyway, I don't want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that.
Don't worry. There are many other options using the internet as dating methods. Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications.
Of course, For these sites, You have to pay a membership fee. But all in all, It is more serious and professional. The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher.
I don't want to post my personal information on the internet. I'm not knowing who is reading it.
Hi, Darling, I am thinking it is the time of your calling.
Are you OK today?
Quite good except thinking of you so much.
So do I. You are a beautiful flower in my mind.
It's called love is blind, I think.
Yes, I did. It is a horrible movie.
I wonder why TV programs often show much violence.
Actually, More and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers.
They are especially harmful to teenagers.
But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs.
It makes me sick.
Yes, How should I set up my new computer?
It's easy, Let me help you.
Great, Thanks a lot.
Good morning, Miss Bell!
Nice to see you again.
Nice to see you too. It's been a long time.
How is everything?
Just fine, And you?
Quite well, Thank you.
Did you drive yourself to the airport?
No, I was driven by my husband.
Did someone meet you at the airport here?
Yes, Thanks.
Is this where we'll be holding the meeting?
No, The meeting will be held on the fourth floor.
Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday.
Yeah, But I don't know if it is going to be any good.
The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five.
True. Ok. Let's see it this Saturday.
How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00, And then go see the movie afterwards.
Sounds like a plan. Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00.
Nothing special, Just working. Why do you ask?
Well, I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping. Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend?
I'd like to, But I'm not sure if I can. Work has been really busy lately. Why don't we go on Friday instead?
Friday's not good. I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work.
Ok, Then let's try to go this weekend. I should know if I can go by Friday. Is it OK if I call you then?
Yeah, That's fine.
What's your number?
233-331-8828. Let me give you my email address too. It's Tom861@gmail. Com.
Ok, I'll talk to you soon.
Ok.
Fill in the slip, Then take it to the circulation desk. They will get you what you want.
Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books?
Sorry, The stacks are closed to undergraduate students.
Jason, You have no taste. You think First Blood is a good movie.
Hey, It is! A lot of people like that movie!
I'm sorry, But it's a bad movie. The plot is stupid, And the script is poorly written.
Face it, You don't like action movies because you're a snob.
No, I don't like action movies because I'm cultured!
Are you serious?
Yes, I mean it.
But why? Did I do anything wrong?
No, We are just too different. This relationship isn't going anywhere.
Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.
I have thought about it for a long time. I think it's time to move on for both of us.
But I still love you.
I'm sorry.
I knew this would happen some day...
Then why didn't you talk to me?
Well. It's not all my fault, Anna...
I don't want to argue with you anymore. This is going to be tough, But let's try to forget that and be friends.
Have you made the decision yet?
I think we'll be better off if we are apart.
Then shall we keep pure friendship?
Sure, Let's just be friends.
Sorry, I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight.
What are you doing?
I'm going to my parents 'house for my father's birthday.
How old is he today?
It's his 50th birthday.
Well, Wish him a happy birthday for me.
Sure thing. What are your plans for the evening?
I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight.
Well, If you can wait until tomorrow night, I'll go with you then.
Sorry, I've got people coming over tomorrow night.
Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us.
Sounds that way. Maybe some other time then?
Sure. Hey, I'm sorry, But I've got to get going.
Yeah, Me, Too. It's about time I made a move.
Say hello to your friends for me.
Likewise. See you later.
Bye!
Of course, Just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished.
I'm finished.
I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form, Please.
Ok, The form is all filled out.
Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?
No, I have no idea what they are.
Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.
Yes, Right.
Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.
He asked me to beef up in the work.
Yeah. You look so unhappy recently. What's the matter.
Nothing, Thanks. I am just not in the mood these days.
I'm just watching some television.
I'm so bored. I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning.
Me too. Do you think we are boring people?
I don't think we are boring. It's just that we don't have any hobbies.
That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?
That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, So I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.
I like to play the piano for fun.
Yeah. That can be a good hobby.
Hobbies are great. I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do.
That's a great idea. I'm going to do the same.
You!
What are you talking about? What did I do?
You told Martha that I was on a date? What was that all about?
No... That's not what I meant. I didn't mean that. She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara. I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends.
She started feeling suspicious after you said that.
I'm sorry man. I didn't know. I didn't mean to screw anything up.
Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend. Now, I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you.
Look. I really didn't mean to, And next time I see Martha, I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends.
Don't bother.
I don't really mind.
We can go to that new Chinese restaurant.
I suppose I could.
Come on, Let's try it.
All right. If you really want to.
It's nice of you to see my off at the airport. Thank you very much.
We'll miss you. I hope we'll keep in touch.
Sure. You've given a great help to me in the past days.
It's my pleasure. We hope you'll visit Beijing again.
Certainly. I'll be glad to.
It's almost time to get aboard.
Yes, We should go. Thank you very much. Goodbye!
Bye bye! Have a pleasant journey!
Why?
I did experience a winter with snow in Kunming, The Spring City.
With snow in Kunming? That's crazy!
Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile?
I drive an automobile.
Fine. You can either park in the student lot or on the street. Do you know what a handicapped space is?
Yes, I have seen those spots.
Well, When you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, Do not park there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening?
I park in the evenings.
Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs?
Yes, I have seen those signs.
The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do you know how to read the curb colors?
Yes, I know what the curb colors mean.
Well, Just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading, I think you know what you need to know.
For more than five years.
Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture?
It's no picnic.
What are those?
They are the things that make up the atom, Such as electrons and protons.
Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons?
Of course there is. Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can.
I really don't want to know about this. Physics gives me a headache.
Oh, A bouquet of flowers. It's very kind of you.
I hope you like it.
I love flowers, You know. Thank you very much.
That's all right.
Supervisor. Open the door.
Wait a sec.
What are you doing here?
We're watching a football match. What's the matter?
Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep.
I'm sorry about this.
Please turn down the TV. And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration.
You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore.
I like girls who like to have fun, And aren't too serious.
I agree. I like guys that can make me laugh.
That's true. Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring.
I think so.
Well. Let's go swimming.
Don't you think it's a bit cold for that?
Then why don't we go for a walk in the hills. It'd be very good for us you know.
My car won't start! Stupid old car!
Hold on, Before you kick your car let's go through some possible problems.
Fine.
Ok, First of all, Can you turn the key in the ignition?
Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.
Those are possible problems, But tell me, When you turn the key, Do you hear the starter motor crank?
Yeah, It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, But nothing else happens. The engine won't start. Should I maybe press the accelerator?
No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.
So what do you think it is?
I know this may seem like a silly question, But does your car have gasoline?
Umm. Yeah! Right! I got the car started! Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the tank!
You can't be serious.
Yes, I ‘m just reading them myself. It's been a great competition. We got gold medals in three events.
Yes, We won the men's 110 metres hurdles. I watched that on TV. What other events did we win?
We won the men's high jump and the women's 1500 meters.
That's great. Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition. They must be terribly disappointed if they don't win.
The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds.
That's amazing! Were any other records broken?
A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters. Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump, But it only got him third place.
Did you see the final of the men's 100 metres? It was very exciting. One competitor made two false starts.
Was he disqualified?
Yes, He was. I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that.
Thanks, Jim. I didn't think guys paid attention to stuff like that.
No, We just don't usually admit it!
Well, Thanks for the compliment anyway!
Sure, What's up?
I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight. Who do you think will win?
Good question. I have to think about it.
My husband is betting on France.
France? Is he crazy?
What do you mean?
Well, How can I put this? France is a terrible team.
My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture.
No wonder you look so upset. Have you called the police?
Yes, I have. But I have to wait.
Oh, Not too bad, But I've got to stay in bed.
Do more exercises after you are healthy.
Ok, I will. You have said that many times.
Are you hungry? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat?
No, There's no need. Thank you all the same.
Yes, I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University.
When did you graduate?
Just a few years ago. What about you?
I just graduated from high school.
Are you planning on going to university?
I'd like to get a BA, But I don't know where I should go.
Have you applied anywhere yet?
Yes, I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them.
Congratulations! Which one is the cheapest?
The tuition is the same for all of them.
Which one has the most interesting course?
I think the course at Leeds University is interesting, But I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical.
Where would you like to be located?
I'd really like to be in London, But it's the most expensive city in England to live in, So I don't know if I can afford to live there.
Have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort?
Not yet.
I think you should do that soon. It will help you make a decision about the school you go to.
That's a good idea.
Good luck!
Yes, Certainly. How can I help you?
Do you know if train 10 is on time to be here?
Sorry, I don't know. I'm a passengers'm waiting for my train...
Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while?
Certainly not. Here it is.
Thanks a lot.
Yes. That would be good.
Oh, No.
What's the matter?
This machine is out of order.
You shouldn't have used the machine. Did you lose your money?
I sure did.
You ought to complain. These machine are always out of order.
I can't deny that. She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight. I wish I knew more about her.
But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl.
I cannot belive that. It must be cooked up by someone.
I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action, But I doubt it'll happen before it's too late.
We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere. There's lots of clean, Modern technology, But companies in developed countries say it's expensive. Developing countries.
Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term, Rather than the long term. It's the same with the destruction of the rainforests. Countries and companies just want the wood. They're not thinking a.
In other parts of the world, Especially in Africa, There is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow e.
It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains. Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people.
Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment.
I think I'd like to do that. I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies.
No, I am not eating there anymore. I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner. The food served in the cafeteria is not my type. I am a total meat lover. But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian. They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days. Haven't you noticed that?
That's fine with me. I don't hate vegetables and I don't eat much during lunch.
Well, Then the cafeteria suits you best. But anyway, If you like to have a lunch outside the company, Feel free to join me anytime.
That's a secret.
Thank you, But Alice is only a visitor here. I don't know if she'll keep it.
To tell you the truth, The dog isn't my real reason for coming. I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend.
Really?
Oh, Hi Lucas, Come on in. I'm Barbara. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Would you like something to drink? I've got tea and some grape juice.
Thanks. Some tea would be nice. Chinese tea is great. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it?
Oh, There is a supermarket not far from here. But there is also a tea house around the corner, Where you can get tea and a tea set as well.
Oh yeah, I saw the tea house the other day. I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here.
You are right about that. It's quiet and very convenient. You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk. There's a grocery store, A book store, A gym, And many restaurants.
There's a gym nearby? That's exciting! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible. I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight.
Well, If you want we can go together sometime. Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon, If you like, You can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way.
That would be wonderful. Thanks!
What happened? Did your boss say something to offend you at work?
He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out, Referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling. I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment.
Don't you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn't be so bad...
You're missing the point. It's about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, As if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It's his attitude that needs to be changed, Not just his words.
That's what you get for working in a male-dominated field. I think you'll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way. You probably won't be able to change him.
Thomas, If I could write with the beauty in her eyes, I was born to look in them and know myself.
And, Her lips?
Her lips? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy.
And her voice like a lark's song?
Deeper, Softer, None of your twittering larks. I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song.
Oh, She sings too?
Constantly. Without doubt, And plays the lute. She has a natural ear.
Sorry, I have to work overtime.
You are really career minded.
My boss promised to pay me double time.
Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city?
Well yes, But they are not allowed only in downtown areas. It's OK here. It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition. The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken. Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there.
Fantastic! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds!
What other activities will you have tomorrow?
Quite a lot. The celebration of the New Year has just started. The first day wesoutherners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast, And people in the North have Jiaozi. Afterward, We will make New Year calls on family relatives, Husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second.
Do you bring some gifts along?
That's for sure. Fruit, Cream cakes, Medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives, And cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids. All this, Of course, Should be well prepared beforehand.
Is it the same practice for all families?
Not all the same nowadays I must say. Many families, Especially those of newly married couples, Choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines. Rose and I had a tour to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong last year. We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday.
I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings. The holiday's long enough for you to relax.
Well, For city dwellers, The Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days. While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized, The festival lasts ten days.
I don't know why I cannot take a step forward.
You are meeting trouble halfway, I guess.
Many things are troubling me. I don't know whether I should come and go.
That's where the shoe pinches.
I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood, But it isn't.
What's wrong?
One of my neighbors has a dog.
Does it make a lot of noise?
It barks all night long.
Sure, Johnny, How much do you need? Five bucks?
Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market. You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, The inevitable recession, People stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.
I don't know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, It would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don't know if you're aware son, But there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, And we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There's just too much instability. I wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.
But look at it this way, Every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, For example, They have 1. 4 billion people, Half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.
Come on, Son, You're looking at this too naively, The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, And their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.
Fine, Then! If that's the way you feel, So be it. But you're losing out on a great opportunity here. I'm going to go hit up Mum for the cash.
It's harmful not only for yourself but for others.
What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking?
Stop producing cigarettes.
But that'll affect the national economy.
That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.
How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet?
Maybe it can take effect.
I like playing computer games, But I'm not really into board games.
How about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire?
The Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned!
If I taught you how to do it, I'm sure you could solve it.
How did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube?
I didn't really have to figure it out. I just followed the instructions!
I had no idea there were a set of instructions. I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses!
Hints are really important when you're solving puzzles. If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game, I'll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube.
It's a deal.
Do you remember, Years ago, When everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos?
Yeah. That was a strange party. Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks?
I don't know. I haven't tried yo-yo since that party!
I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo.
If you don't start when you're young, It's hard to get the hang of it.
Let's get started with this game then.
Ok.
And good shot!
A goal!
What is it?
You have to take the math and English evaluation tests.
Why?
Because you're from a foreign country. The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills.
It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes, Right?
You are a smart girl!
This is going to take more time than I thought.
Okay. Let's clear the air. What are you getting at?
You always have a chip on your shoulder.
I'm sorry. But I don't meant to get your goat.
The Godfather and The Godfather II, Of course. They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
Whew! I'm impressed! You really know your stuff!
Only about old movies, Really...
It's a typical of them to do so.
What can we do?
We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it.
That's great. What are the prizes?
3000 RIB as bonus for each person.
To encourage the staff increases.
Ok. Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM. At 12 AM, Back here for lunch.
What about the afternoon?
At 2 PM, Give a presentation here with the press. At four o 'clock sharp, Have dinner with Mr. Smith, Manager of NCC.
I get along pretty well with most of them. It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch, Though, Like Margaret. I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet. She's a terrible gossip.
Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip?
It's not only that she gossips, But she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers. She's not trustworthy, And in my opinion, I think she's nuts.
So how do you develop good relationships in the office?
I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs. If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment, You should be able to get along with most of the people you work with.
I think you're right, But it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others.
I'm glad you came. You're welcome anytime.
Thanks. By the way, Tell your wife she throws a great party.
I will. See you later.
I met him through a computer bulletin board.
Oh, Really? Which bulletin board?
It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net. It's been around since around 1991.
I've heard about that, But I've never tried it.
You ought to. One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time. A Chat session links you with cappuccinosippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network.
I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers.
That's the whole point. All your inhibitions disappear because you can't see the other person. This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn't talk to.
I just want a private conversation with one other person.
You can do that. A private session lets two people talk alone. This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody, Without prejudice because you can't see them.
Well, Maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk.
That's fine with me, But we'll have to get there early. Because after 8 pm, There is always a long line.
It's that popular?
It sure is.
Yes, It looks interesting.
You're right. I love it very much.
It must be old.
At least more than 100 years old.
Let's enter it!
I can't open the door.
It must be locked.
Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.
She can't answer you.
She must be deaf.
It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?
Frightened? You must be joking.
Thanks. You too!
Do you have any plans?
Well, My family's away and I can't afford to do much. What about you?
Oh, I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet.
I major in Chemistry.
What is your specialty?
Organic Chemistry is my specialty.
I have no idea.
Why don't you go sightseeing?
It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots. What about your plans?
I intend to stay at home for the whole seven days and have a good rest.
No. I caught a cold two days ago. I only finish reading half of it.
I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling now?
I'm feeling better today.
How many days do you plan to finish reading it?
About more three days, I think.
Ok. After three days, I will come to you for it.
No problem.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I just bumped into the table.
Hum, Me too. This winter holiday was especially long. What have you done?
Nothing special. I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school, Visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for. How about yours?
You know, I like traveling. I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself.
Where did you get that idea?
That's the impression I get from the movies, And from looking around. Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other.
Well, I'm still not sure what you're asking me.
Is it true or isn't it?
Do you want to know something about the American character?
I just think you're trying to change the subject. But go ahead.
No, This will help answer your question. In American society boys and girls are raised together. They're not segregated in their activities! Boys and girls go out together from an early age.
Ok, Go on.
After being raised together, Men and women can be business-like in each other's company. It really doesn't have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love. Does that answer your question?
Not exactly, But I see your point.
I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office. After you'Ve been in America for a while, You will probably see what I mean.
Yes, The weather sure is nice today.
I love it when the weather is like this. Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch?
That sounds like a good idea. The sky is clear, The sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze, So it is not too hot.
I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado. But I must admit, This sure is a nice spring day.
Hey, This spot in the shade looks really comfortable.
Okay. Hey, Is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?
I don't think so. I say the weather report last night, And it said the weather should be fine all day.
If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend. It's been a while since I've not really gotten some sun.
Yes.
Could you please get me a takeaway? I have some urgent work to finish. So I don't have enough time to go out for lunch.
No problem. What should I bring?
I am not picky on food. Just bring me the day menu.
150 pounds.
Do put yourself on a diet, Otherwise you'll be too fat.
I can't bear eating less.
Yeah. Last semester.
Who was the professor?
It was Professor Johnson.
I have him this semester. What do you think about him?
He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot, But fortunately, He's an easy grader.
What did you end up getting?
I got an A -. Sounds good, But none of my test scores were that high, So I don't know how I got a decent grade.
That's probably because he grades on a curve.
Are you enjoying the class so far?
I hate it and I was about to withdrawal. But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out.
Yes. Definitely stay in the class. You will get a better grade than your test scores. He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot.
Thanks for letting me know. I feel relieved now.
Only four days.
Only four days! That's so short, And you seem so crazy about her.
I know. I can't help thinking about her. She's always on my mind.
Hey, The same to you!
Time flies! One year has already been a history!
Definitely, It's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year!
Yeah. Have you made any good resolutions for this new year?
Some resolutions? That's a wonderful idea, But I have no idea yet. How about you?
I want to be healthier this year, So I think I should take more exercise.
That will be a good one! Anything else?
Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry, Which is a mess!
Sounds great!
What do you mean by that?
Oh, That means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions.
You've been always active and versatile. It seems that you are interested in everything.
Oh, Really? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert, Painting, Handwriting, Reading novels and reading fashion magazines. What about yours?
I have fewer hobbies than yours. That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting.
Oh, You can't think like that. We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas. You like taking photos and going to photography shows, Why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable?
That's a good suggestion. It's fine today. Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset. It must be fantastic.
I quite agree with you. With our hobbies, Our life can be more colorful and exciting.
And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend.
Yes, It's a good habit to have a life-long hobby. Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer.
Umm... I think so. What's up?
I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies... But it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim.
Really? Are you OK?
I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option. Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing?
If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered.
Hummum... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that. Anyway... Now that I'm going to have to make some claims, I think I'd better try and understand how the system works. Would you mind breaking it down for me?
Sure. Basically we have two insurance policies for employees... Workman's compensation and medical insurance. The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation, And for a significant part of the medical coverage, But you pay part of that premium, Too.
That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month, Right?
Yep. Every country in the world has a different system, But here we buy insurance from a private provider.
So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job, Right?
That's right. The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating.
Try to keep cool. It's not an easy take.
I know. I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Then you will be in line for a doom.
I'm great. Thanks.
Did you need something?
I need your help.
How may I help you?
I need to find this newspaper article.
Have you checked the periodicals section yet?
I forgot about that section.
If you'd like, I can show you were to find it.
Could you do that?
Follow me.
Thank you for all your help.
You're in America now, My British friend. We just call it football.
Oh, Right. So, I can't quite follow what's going on... Who's winning?
The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked, But the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone.
Wow! What a hit!
Yeah, He tackled him so hard his helmet came off.
Is he ok?
It looks like it, He's getting up.
I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team.
The Giants?
Yeah.
Well, Here we go again.
What happened? Why did everyone get so quiet?
The Redskin's quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points. We're losing again.
Sure. I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies, Not new pets!
Well, This is my new baby. He's just as much trouble. That's for sure! But, He's a lot of fun!
I see what you mean. He's really cute. How old is he?
Are you going to take your children along?
No, I'd like to go alone.
Have a nice holiday!
What kind of movie is it?
It's a feature film.
Oh, I've no interest in such films.
I am seven.
I see, You have seven candles on the cake.
Yes, I am seven. I am a big girl now.
We will have a party here, Right?
Yes, Come on, And we will have fun.
Why, This is the most interesting film!
I hate the hero. He's too cruel.
But it's only a film.
What is it?
You are going to be a father.
What? Do you mean that you are pregnant? Is it true?
Yes. We'll have our baby soon.
Oh, Dear, I'm so happy.
Me, Too.
Yes, Actually. I don't really know anyone, But it's a nice place. Are you having a good time?
Yes. The drinks are very good! I'm Paul, By the way.
Hello Paul. I'm Jane. So what do you do?
I'm in finance. You?
Really? Me, Too. I work for an accountancy company,T &D. Maybe you've heard of them.
T &D? Oh, Yes, Sure. How long have you worked there?
About two years. And you? Are you based here?
No. Actually, I'm based in Shanghai. I'm just here for the conference. So,T &D eh...
Not anymore. Now I work nine hours a day, And I get a good sleep almost every night. No more burning the candle at both ends.
And?
And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy.
Poor child!
Yes, I am. You must be Tom. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too. Let me help you with your bags.
Be careful, Tom. Those are pretty heavy.
Wow, You're not kidding. Hold on a second. Hello, Could you give us a hand, Please?
Not at all. But I've found satisfaction in it!
Do you put your feet on your own table?
No, I never do that.
Why not?
I don't want to mark my table, Of course.
Well, Will you please put them down?
I'm sorry. I thought you wouldn't come back so early.
I forgot something on the table.
Oh, You've got a good memory.
Could I check out this book?
Let me see your library card.
I need to get one.
You can apply for one right now, If you'd like.
Okay. Let me do that right now.
Could you fill out this application?
I'm finished. Here you go.
Could you please sign the back of the card?
All right.
That's it.
Now may I check this book out?
I don't care what the best part is. Whatever you say won't change my mind. I'm not buying anything!
That stamp you've been looking for is for sale.
The 1879 Large Dragon? Are you serious? How much?
Hey! I thought you weren't interested! Sorry, I've gotta go! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest.
I'm not sure. I guess I'll just stay at home. Maybe I'll catch up on my reading. What about you? Any plans?
Well, My parents have rented a condominium in Florida. I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming.
Sounds great!
Say, Why don't you come with us? We have plenty of room.
Do you mean it? I'd love to!
Oh, My dear lady. Take it easy. You should forgive a green hand like him.
He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy.
I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.
I have told him how to do it several times, But he's never listened to me.
Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss.
Oh, I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff.
Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do, Make sure you don't lose your temper.
I think that's a bad idea. I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend. How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want?
I disagree. All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions.
Yes, Of course. I love the picnic party. It's really family fun time.
This time you can bring your daughter with you.
Right, She is so excited and simply can't wait.
There are times of games planned, Should have a grand time.
And what's the problem?
When I asked how people were going to dress, Dr. Lite said it was casual.
And you want to know what to wear?
Well, Last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party, But I was overdressed. I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt, Blouse, Scarf, And medium heels... You know.
That sounds just right to me. What was wrong with it?
Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans. Several of the women had on running shoes. I felt out of place. So I have no idea what to wear tonight.
My guess is you can safely wear last night's outfit to tonight's party.
Happy birthday to you! I'd really love to come, But I'm not sure right now. I'll try to make it. Thank you for your invitation.
Big time! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information. You really think it's completely safe?
Well, Maybe not 100 percent. I did hear about some tricks people use.
Now we're getting to the truth.
There are shills. A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale.
See? And I bet that's easy to do online. Everybody's anonymous.
Eight altogether.
How are they proportioned?
Six are compulsory, Two optional.
I don't know. What do you think?
I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English, And uses it as a basis for communicating. From start to finish he's learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar. This is a very difficult way to learn.
What do natives get?
They get higher level English, Which is more formal than everyday spoken English. They also deal with matters of style and creativity.
Do you mean that a native doesn't make any mistakes in grammar?
Absolutely not! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes, Especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken.
I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don't know standard English in American universities.
Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think. That's why it's so important to quit worrying about making mistakes. Just talk to everyone every chance you get.
No, I shouldn't think so. But you must take your passport of course.
Yes, I know. I must get my traveler's check and some foreign currency.
Yes, You need the traveler's check but you needn't get any foreign currency. You can have my US Dollars, I don't need them.
Really? That's very good of you, Helen. But I must get a new suitcase, My old one needs repairing.
You needn't buy one. You can have mine.
That's very kind of you, Helen. I hope you don't mind my leaving you like this. I need a holiday. It won't be long.
Don't be silly, John. I'm going with you. It's necessary for me to have a holiday too.
Yes, It's my new business phone. Do you like it?
It's very impressive. Can you use the Internet on your phone?
Yes, It's got wireless Internet access.
That's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth?
Yes, But I don't really use it that often. Have you ever used it?
No, But I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go.
Yes, I guess I should try to use it.
Does it have a camera?
Of course it does. Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days?
I guess so. Would you mind if I checked my email quickly? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client.
Sure. Here you go.
Have you checked your voicemail recently?
No, Why?
I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message.
Oh, Yeah. Probably. I don't really know how to use this phone yet.
Do you want to listen to your messages first?
No, It's ok. Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later.
I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone.
I'm surprised you know so much about it. Where's your phone?
It quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet.
How have you been living without a cell phone for a week? Hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone?
It's not that bad. It kind of feels like I'm on vacation, Not having to answer my phone all the time!
Let's go shopping. You can't depend on public phones in this day and age!
Well, It's hard to say. I coughed a lot in the evening.
You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health.
You're right. But you know it's so hard to give up the old habit like smoking.
But you should make up your mind first.
You know I often have to work far into the night. I need smoking to keep me awake.
Why don't you go to bed early and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.
Thank you for your advice. I'll try it.
There're many things I can do on weekends.
What sort of things are you interested in?
I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots. More often than not, I go with some of my friends. By the way, What are your favorites?
I love swimming and cycling. On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour. In the afternoon, I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours.
That's great! I think they do you a lot of good. Where do you swim?
Mostly in the city's swimming pool. But on occasion, I go to the beach with friends. Well, What do you do at leisure?
I'm fond of dancing.
Good. You really know how to enjoy yourself.
He spoke evil behind his back.
How did he know that he had badmouthed him?
Someone told Joe off.
He is then in a very difficult situation.
Sure. He'll get the bag, I think.
There's no need to apologize.
But I ruined your rug.
Forget it. It was an accident.
I'Ve just parted with my boyfriend.
Oh, Cheer up. A boyfriend is not everything.
But I cannot forget him.
We offer many different sea water treatments.
How many can we choose?
The aquamedic pool is included. You can choose three.
We'll do the seaweed wrap, The jet bath, And the foot massage.
Ok. Here are your robes. You can go shower first.
I wouldn't miss it for the world! It's sure to be fun. She's invited a lot of people. Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house?
If everyone turned up, It would be a squeeze, But a few people said that they couldn't go, So I think it should be ok?
Are you taking anything?
I'Ve got her a birthday present and I'll take a bottle fo wine too.
That's a good idea. She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks. I think it's going to be a noisy party. I hope her neighbours don't mind too much.
Helen gets on very well with her neighbours. I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the party too.
I'm ready looking forward to it. This party is going to be a blast!
Well, Don't be late. I'll see you on Friday at Helen's.
That's understandable. Every kid likes new clothes.
It was not just that. I didn't like them because they never fitted me.
Yes, Would you like to have the seats in the front or at the back?
In the front, Please.
I learned to drive and I got a driving license.
What will you do this vacation?
Travel.
$ 135.
Wow, That's sheer robbery. Shall I make an offer?
I'm sorry, Sir. The price is fixed.
Here you are.
Do you have any baggage to check in?
Yes, One box.
Would you please put it on the scale?
Ok. By the way, Can you tell me how many kilos of free baggage each passenger is allowed?
The baggage allowance is different according to the class of your ticket. What class are you travelling?
First-class.
For a first-class passenger, The free baggage allowance is forty kilos.
How many pieces of baggage can I carry on to the plane?
Passengers holding first class tickets may carry 2 pieces within the total weight of 5 kg onto the plane.
If my baggage exceeds the allowance, What should I do?
If the checked baggage is over the allowance, We will charge you for the overweight.
I see. Thank you very much for your information.
You're welcome. Your boarding pass and baggage check, Please.
Goodbye!
It depends.
Yes. What can I do for you?
The maid has just delivered some laundry to my room. But it's not mine at all.
I am sorry. Sir. We will send someone immediately.
I was born and grew up in hebes Province. I moved to Beijing, Where I started taking courses for my MBA. When I completed my degree, I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company. I've worked there for eight years.
What was the most significant project you've worked on?
I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system. It was a challenge for a person with a finance background. I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles. Based on that information, I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project. We got the project done on schedule. I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team.
What finance experience makes you qualified for this position?
For the past eight years, I have been working in the banking industry. I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts, An analytical mind and a strong attention to detail. I've had a lot of customer service training and experience, And I have been told that I excel in this area.
How would your coworkers evaluate you?
They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player.
What are your salary expectations?
I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary. I'd like to postpone that decision until later.
Then you must hurry up. There's only ten minutes left.
Until we meet again.
We're redecorating our living room.
What are you going to do to it?
First, We're going to change the curtains, Then we're going to paint the walls.
What colour are you going to paint them?
Pale yellow.
What else are you going to do?
We're going to put in some new furniture.
To cancel your reservation, I need your name, Phone number, And date of trip, Please.
Rudy Randolph, 818-555-1234. My reservation begins on the second Monday of April.
I see your reservation on my computer. Let me just cancel it, And you'll be all set!
Thanks. I'll call again when things get better at home.
You're welcome.
Yes, Of course. I'll take it.
But it costs an arm and leg.
I like it.
I really appreciate your offer, But I have to decline it, Because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in.
You are welcome, Please call me if you change your mind.
I will. Thank you.
I'll have a hamburger.
The works?
No, Just tomatoes, Please. And large fries.
Anything to drink?
A small cola.
I'll have a sandwich and small fries. Would you like to have some desserts?
Apple pie is my favorite dessert.
I'd like to have an ice cream.
Sure, Let's take a look at the menu first.
Do I have to turn on the computer?
Yes, We can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time. And this will help us understand both better.
What should I learn first?
Right now I'll teach you to open files, Save files and copy files. Are you ready?
I am ready I am going to get, Let's start!
Let's order something to eat. What are you in the mood for?
I'll have whatever you're having.
Ok. How about some fried spring rolls and squid balls, Some pork skins, And some beer!
Well... The beer sounds good!
You could get there this way, But it'd be faster to go along the Wort Street.
Where's Wort Street, Please?
Turn right at the third intersection, You'll see the street and then walk along the street to the south.
How far is it from the Wort Street?
Just walk for a few minutes, You'll find it.
Thank you very much.
Yes. I've read it carefully.
And do you have any questions?
No. But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week. Will you have thatmany classes for me right away?
No, Probably not. For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours.
But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month. Will you pay me that much for the first month? Because, I mean, I won't be working so many hours.
I understand. That's why I didn't write the date on the contract. For the first two weeks, We will pay you according to the hours you teach. When you have 22 hours of classes, Then the contract will take effect. Is that alright with you?
Oh, So I don't sign the contract today. Is that right?
I don't want you to misunderstand, Miss Briggs. We are very serious about hiring you. We want you to teach for us. We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient.
I can accept that.
Good. And your benefits will begin immediately.
Even my health insurance?
Yes. We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow. And your free membership in the club starts today if you like.
I have a few questions about the free membership.
What would you like to know?
Is my membership the same as paying club members? I mean, Can I get discounts at club hotels?
Absolutely. The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers.
What are bar vouchers?
Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers. The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge. But we don't offer vouchers to employees.
But according to the contract, Employees get a discount in the restaurant.
That's right. So in a way, It is cheaper for you than for the members. You get more benefits than they do.
So, For now, You want me to keep a copy of the contract. But we won't sign it yet. That right?
Yes. I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything. So that you understand the terms.
I understand. And according to the terms on the contract, I am happy to accept this job. I look forward to it.
I'm very pleased. We look forward to having you here, Miss Briggs.
Yes. But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer.
That's no problem. It is made of linen, So you won't feel hot in it. I can assure you it is of superior quality. What is more, It is very popular with young women.
How much is it?
88 Yuan.
Ok, That is reasonable. I will take it.
I think I am who you are looking for. You have got to be Rubin.
That would be me!
Rubin! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before.
I hope that what they had to say was mostly good!
They only said wonderful things about you. You did a good job of finding me.
Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard.
Yes, I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons!
I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe.
Lunch sounds great! Let's head on out!
Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection. It'll be right there.
Is it far?
No, It should only take you about 15 minutes by foot.
Thank you.
Yes. I could use a cup of coffee.
Are you going to have anything to eat?
French toast sounds good. What are you going to order?
I'll have that too.
I agree. I'll look in the paper.
A house would be great. I could plant a garden. And you could use the garage for a workshop.
Here's an interesting ad.
How much is the rent?
The ad says $ 325 plus deposit.
When is the place available?
It's available now, And it's got a very good location. You won't be far from work.
Escrow involves a lot of paperwork, But I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along.
What should I have brought with me?
The only thing I will need to see is your driver's license, As I will be notarizing these papers.
I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers.
Don't worry about how many papers there are. We are going to look at them one at a time.
My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question.
Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents.
Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine?
At the close of escrow, The house will be yours!
Sure. How do you like your meal today?
Quite good. It was the most wonderful dinner I have ever had.
I am glad you like it. Welcome next time.
I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book.
Ok Sir. Could you tell me the account holder's name, The account number, The amount in the account and your PIN number, Please?
Well, The account's in my name. Patrick Dean, That'sD-E-A-N. The account number is 15273478841. There was about 20, 000 RIB inside.
Ok, Sir. Almost there, I just need your PIN number. When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number. It's a very simple procedure.
Ok, It's 672910.
Sure, Go ahead.
Could you tell me where the canteen is?
Sure, I can take you there actually.
Oh, I don't want to trouble you.
It's fine. I was heading there anyway.
Yes. If you don't mind sharing room, There's one available.
How much is it?
$ 30. 00 a week.
Do you think I could have a look at it, Please.
I'm on my way out now. Could you come back in an hour?
I'll have the kung PAO chicken, Please.
Certainly sir, Would you like some rice or noodles with that?
Just some fried rice please.
Ok, Would you like some soup as well?
No, Thanks.
Thank you very much. Your food will be ready soon.
Yes. Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany?
Well, You can pay by mail, Telegraphic or SWIFT transfer. Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary.
Which is the best way?
It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money. A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest. How much do you wanna send?
$ 800.
Why don't you send it by mail payment order?
How long does it take?
About a week.
I don't know. Can I send it more quickly?
Sure. You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer.
And how long do those take?
Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days, Depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank.
I see. How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer?
You have to fill out this form, Ma'am.
But I'Ve never been on a business trip before!
It's easy enough. Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses. The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses.
So the company will pay for everything?
Yes, But when you send in your expense report, You also have to file a report summarizing your trip. It's not just a big vacation, You know.
That sounds good. But what do you want me to do there?
I'Ve already paved the way. You just have to give a presentation on what our products are. I will do the follow-up and close the sale.
Thanks, Doc. I'Ve got a really bad toothache! I can't eat anything, And look, My face is all swollen. I think it might be my wisdom tooth.
Well, Let's have a look. Open wide. Hmm... This doesn't look good. Well, It looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, And the crown probably needs to be refitted. I'm going to order some x-rays.
Is it gonna hurt?
No, Not at all! Just lay back and relax.
Ok, Spit.
Well, Let me see. Now it's 11:00 sharp. It's a long way to go. If I take the shortest route, We may come across a traffic jam. If I take a less heavy route, It will save us 10 or more minutes, But you'll have to pay more. Which do you prefer?
Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route?
Generally speaking, We can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens.
How much more do I have to pay?
Compared to the shortest route, You may pay around 5 Euro more.
That's acceptable. No one wants to miss a train.
Ok... Here we are. We'll turn left at this cross. To go straight ahead is the shortest route.
Thank you!
Weigh? It must be a greatest Chinese invention. I've tried hard to learn it. Its rules can't be any simpler, But I've never won a game of Go. Well, It's all Greek to me!
At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game, Haven't you? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence, Cultivating personality and flexible learning. Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go.
I heard it is included in the four major arts of China, Is it?
Sure. It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither, Weigh, Calligraphy and painting. I think weigh is the most fantastic of them. It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness.
I know it is quite different from Western chess.
Yes. Playing chess is a very aggressive experience. All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents. Whenever I start a chess game, I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill.
But isn't it the same with wiki?
Certainly not. The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent. In other words, Each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board. Hence, Chess aims to kill, While weigh is most concerned with howso survive.
I only wish it were this time yesterday.
Think how happy we were. Now this. Things always go wrong.
Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast. We'd feel better.
I don't feel like breakfast. I don't feel like anything. Why are we so unlucky? It's as if there were a jinx on us.
Perhaps I'd better ring the police...
Yes. Of course. But what good will it do? That man's miles away from here by now. In our car.
Thank you.
Do you have a reservation?
Yes, I do.
May I have your name, Please?
Yes, It's Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown. We were expecting you. This way, Please. Will this table be fine?
Oh, This is just fine.
Please take a seat.
Thank you.
Here is the menu.
Nice to meet you, Too.
You are a graduate, Right?
I recently graduated from college as an English major.
So you don't have much related work experience.
Admittedly, I don't. But I still beg you to give me an opportunity, And I'm willing to learn with my best effort.
Well, Did you get any honors or rewards in college?
I have got a Business English Certificate and a Certificate ofTEM 8.
What about your computer skills?
I got professional training in this field, And I believe I can fit the position well.
And anything else?
I have taken some courses in college, Such as translation, Business English, And so on. So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English.
I see.
Your approval would be my honor.
You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world.
I know. But we could get some exercise in, And we could get some errands run, Too. Window-shopping won't cost you anything.
What kind of errands do we need to run?
Well, We could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper, Go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner, And to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor.
I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight.
Fine, We'll do that on the way home, So we don't have to carry it the whole time.
Sounds good. You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though. I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms, Especially if the stores have special offers.
I promise. We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven't had time for.
Ok, Let's go then!
Do you have any money?
For what?
For our errands, And maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street.
You said you were only going to window shop!
I agreed to not go into the mall, But I can still look at things in the market!
I should have known...
Just what are you proposing?
We could take a cut on the price. But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin. We suggest a compromise 10 %.
That's a big change from 25 %! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit. Any other ideas?
I don't think I can change it right now. Why don't we talk again tomorrow?
Sure. I have to talk to my office anyway. I hope we can find some common ground on this.
Robert, I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed, But we can try to come up with something else.
I hope so, Dana. My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal, But I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground.
I understand. We propose a structured deal. For the first six months, We get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 %.
Dana. I can't bring those numbers back to my office, They'll turn it down flat.
Then you'll have to think of something better, Robert.
Hello. I'm here to get my salary.
I see. Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you? I'll need your password for this transaction.
No problem.
And how much of your salary would you like?
I think just 3, 000 RIB will be enough.
Yes. This is the first time I've come here. Could you please tell me something about it?
Sure Those who have heart disease or high blood pressure are not allowed to take sauna, For their sake.
Thank you for telling me about this. What should I do here?
First, Change your shoes to slippers. Then walk up to the changing room to get prepared for a shower.
Ok. How about after the shower?
After the shower, Step into the washroom with birch switches, Dip them in the warm water and briskly whisk them over your skin.
That sounds comfortable.
Yes, Then enter the bathroom, There is a stove tired with wood in the room, And on the top of the stove, There is a pile of stones, Which keep the heat. Throw some water on the stones, And dry steam is given off.
Can I have a look at your handworks?
All right. This way, Please.
You have quite a range, Haven't you?
Yes, Sir.
They are all produced in China, Aren't they?
Yes, They are all distinctive Chinese.
Could you please select me one?
How do you like this one? It's very beautiful.
Oh, I like it very much. How much does it cost?
350 yuan.
Ok. I'll take it.
Yes, Mr. Emory?
I'Ve got some bad news. All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected. We're going to have to start from scratch.
I thought they had already agreed to everything. That's going to take weeks torework.
May I make a reservation?
Of course. At what time?
The four of us will be there at 7:00 this evening.
Ok, Sir. We are looking forward to your arrival.

You'Ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why are things delayed?
Well, The thing is, We ran into a lot of problems...
I'm not looking for excuses here. I just want to get this finished on time!
I know, And I apologize for the delay. But some things were just beyond my control. I had trouble booking the photographer, And then Michael was sick for three weeks, So I couldn't include him in the photos, And the design team lost all the files, So I had tore-do the pictures.
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I want those photos ASAP!

That's correct. Thank you very much.
Here you are. It's 90 yuan, Miss.
Can you give me a discount?
20 percent is the best discount I can offer. That will came to 72yuan.
Ok. 72 yuan.
Thanks, Miss. I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin, A splendid line, Just came in.
No, Thanks. Not today.
I'll just have this all wrapped up for you.
$ 60.
Well, That's a bit stiff. Do you have some cheaper ones?
Yes, The shoes on that shelf are on sale now. They are much cheaper.
Have you any package tour to Italy?
Yes, Of course. Here are all the tour routes we have to Italy.

We have just 10 days for the vacation.
I wish to buy a diamond ring.
How many carats would you like it to be?
I want five carats.
Is this one suitable for you?
No, It seems too old-fashioned to my fiancee.

Sure, We can reduce our price by ten percent.
That's great.
I'm sorry, Sir. Exactly what is the problem?
I'm knee-deep in cockroaches!
I'm so sorry, Sir. We'll give you a new room immediately, And give you a refund also.
Thank you. I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact.
Sir, We always try to please our guests.
Oh... Um... I don't think so. You know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system. Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you. That's not going to come cheap.
But it would only be adding to the existing structure. We're not talking about anything new here...
It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out, And they are union labor. It'll cost you a pretty penny...
How much do you think it would cost?
Mumm, I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of... $ 500 per light.
$ 500per light?! That's ridiculous! It can't possibly be that expansive!
It is, I'll tell you why. We'll have to call in the electrician, He's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM, And it will probably take him an hour a light. Plus, The halogen lights take more electricity, So your electrical cost is going to be higher as well.
Can't you give me a break on this? We've already spent so much money on lighting, I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens.
No, That's the cost, And that's what it's going to cost us. We can't go in the hole with this. I am giving you my best price, So take it, Or leave it.
I'm glad you like it. The bell is on the bedside. Just ring if you want anything. The room attendant speaks a little English. So I don't think you'll have any trouble.
No, I shouldn't think so. By the way, Is there a socket for my razor?
I think so. Here it is. It's by the basin.
Is it a two-pin socket?
Yes, It is.
Good, I'Ve get a two-pin plug.
They think you are just a child.
But the child has his own feeling.
Maybe you are right. Well, You can talk with them.
Oh, Good! You know, I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs, Not fried.
Oh, I just noticed that I accidentally brought you your friend's breakfast.
I can just trade with him, Thank you.
And pancakes for you, Sir.
I am sorry, But I think I ordered waffles.
I am sorry that I misheard you.
Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles. While I am waiting, I will eat my bacon and eggs.
I will get straight back to you with your waffles.
I would appreciate that.
Hello, There. I'd like to know about Clean Collection. My company in the US is going to send me a cheque. It's for my wages, But I'm not too sure about how to cash it here.
Right. If the cheque is coming from the US, Into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear.
Is there any way we can speed it up?
There is, Actually. If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai, That'll speed things up no end.
Yes, Show me your tickets please.
Here you are. By the way, When does the train leave?
The train is driving after ten minutes.
Thanks. Where is my seat?
It's over there. Have a good trip.
Thank you.
Yes, I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square.
I think I have just a right apartment for you.
Oh, Good. Can you describe it?
Yes. It has one bedroom, A large living space and 4 kitchens.
So is there a refrigerator?
Yes, It's brand-new.
It sounds great. How much is the rent?
It's $ 8. 50 a month.
When can I see it?
We can take a see by there now if you like. The landlord left me a set of keys with me.
Ok, That would be great.
Hi there. I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company. Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything?
Of course. Your balance is 92, 320 RIB in your Securities Account. How much would you like to withdraw?
I'd like 20, 000 RIB, Please. If that's possible.

Good morning, MissMandy. How are you today?
I am not feeling very well. I've got a bad cold.
Have you got a sore throat, Too?
No, But I've got a headache.
Yes, I see. Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours.
Thank you very much.
Sure Tracy, Let me just get my laptop.
Okay, So... To Whom It May Concern, I am writing.
Um, Tracy? I think that's a little too formal. I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them, So in English you can be more relaxed in the opening...
Okay, More relaxed. Got it. Hey, Sally, What's up? It's Tracy here, Just.
Okay Tracy, Now it's too relaxed! You've still got to show some respect. How about starting with "Dear Ms. Cooper, I'm writing to confirm...?.
Great, Okay. "Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine"..
That's great...
" The final costing, Including advert design and production, Comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB. We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad. Thanks for... "..
Woo, Okay, Back up a second, Tracy. That's too direct. Can I suggest you say, Please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication? You don't want to offend her.
Oops, Okay. You are right. Then I can just end with "All the best, Tracy"..
Mmmm, Maybe, But I'd play it safe and just finish with "Yours Sincerely". That's more professional.
Oh, Melanie, You are a life saver, Thank you!
Hi, I'm calling from Nika Corporation. We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant.
Oh, Certainly. I'm Linda, The Manager. I can help you with that. How many will there be in your party?
There will be about 18 people.
Okay. For a party that size, We have a separate banquet room in the back.
Is there an extra charge to reserve the room?
No, As long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests, There is no extra charge.
That's great. I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room, Then, For Friday, December 2, At around noon. This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne. Will that be acceptable?
The cake is no problem at all, But we do charge a corkage fee of $ 15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the restaurant.
Oh, That's fine.
Great. I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December. May I have your name and contact information?
Sure. I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840, Extension 42.
Thanks, Mr. McQuillin. I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements.
Sounds good. Thanks for your help.
Thank you for choosing Bruno's. We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd.
Yes, Show me your ticket and passport please.
Here you are. Can I have a seat in the back of the plane?
No problem. Wish you a nice trip.
One bottle of perfume and a watch.
Where did you buy it?
In Boston.
Do you travel a lot?
Oh... I go to see my sister twice a year or so.
Twice a year? How long has your sister lived in Boston?
Nearly ten years.
I see, That's a long time. How much was the watch?
I can't remember, But I've got the receipt somewhere. Would you like to see it?
Yes, I'd like to see the receipt. Oh! I see you bough the watch last week.
Yes. Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it?
Yes, I'm afraid you will. Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds.
Ok. Here you are. Is that all right now?
Yes, That's fine. I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston?
Yes, I did. I had a fine time.
Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental, Please? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office.
We have 3 different types of boxes. We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box.
I think I'll go for the smallest, As it's just for documents. Will I be the only key holder? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time.
You can have more than 1 key if you'd like, But we must have signature cards for each box.
That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife. I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key. Thanks for your help.
If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance, We can do that for you today, There is no need to wait.
Ok, I'll take a small, For 1 year, In this branch, Please.
I agree,Toni. I think the biggest problem we're facing is how to bring it in under budget.
That's true. But even beyond that, There's the question of meeting the deadlines they'Ve set.
Right. Look, Why don't we make a list of the problems we're dealing with. It'll be easier to work through them that way.
I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field. Since my major was international banking, I really hope to work at a bank.
Then, Why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai?
Because your bank is a new one, I think I'll be given more opportunities, And the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here.
It certainly is. But the work is also hard here. You need to put a lot of hard hours on the job to succeed in this field.
I expect to work hard, Madam.
Do you mind going on frequent business traps?
No, I enjoy travelling.
Surely of course. Here you are.
Is flight ZW203 a direct one?
No, It stopped at Honolulu. Would you like to book one?
No. Is there any direct flight to New York?
Let me see. I am sorry. ZW203 is the only one to New York.
No problem. What size would you like?
A big one would be nice.
How about this one? It's our biggest — 16 'in diameter.
Oh, Yes, I like that one, But it's too heavy.
Okay, Try this one. It's made of aluminum.
Oh, Yes! This is much better. But it has an aluminum handle.
Here you go. Same pan, But with a state-of-the-art, Heat-resistant plastic handle.
Yes. That's perfect. I'll take it.
Great. Will that be cash or charge?
Oh, Wait a minute. What about a lid for the pan?
I'm sorry. I forgot to show you the lid. It comes with the pan.
Of course. Which one do you like best?
I want one that is easy to handle.
Try this one. You can get a picture by simply pressing the shutter.
That's good. What's the fee?
Just give me a second. I'll be right up. I ran a virus scan on your computer, And it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.
Well, You have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly, Yours wasn't up to date, That's probably what was causing your problems.
Ok. Anything else?
Yeah, Try not to kick or hit the computer!
Um yeah. Sorry about that.
I think you should work out more too.
Wow! You are much skinnier since the last time I saw you.
I have lost about five kilos.
How did you do it?
I was on a diet and exercised daily.
I hate working out.
You can try a low-impact workout schedule. Why don't you go to a gym?
Good idea. Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan. Besides that, What's your secret?
The secret is persistence.
Yes, But don't cut them yet. Wait until they cool. Where is the big plastic bowl?
On the bottom shelf in the cupboard under the sink.
What's Donna like, By the way?
Donna? Well. She is about 20. She is very lovely and I think you will like her. What about Paul?
Oh, Paul is very easy-going and friendly.
Could you get me the pepper from the cupboard?
Yes, Sure. Which cupboard is it in?
It's in the small one beside the cooker.
There is no pepper here.
Oh, There Isn't? Oh, No.
Yes, Go straight along Beijing Road and turn right.
Straight on, And turn right. Is it far?
No, It's just a couple of minutes.
Thanks very much.
You're welcome.
Just a moment, Please. I'll see if she's free.
Thanks.
Sorry, Becky can't come to the phone right now.
That's okay. I'll call back later.
I have booked a table for 3 this evening. I would like to cancel it.
May I have your name, Please?
Sure. Brown and we have reserved a table next to the door.
Yes, I see. We will cancel your order.
Let's see. That would be ¥ 160 a day a mile.
That sounds OK. I'll need it from the 10th to the 14th.
Do you have a valid license?
Yeah. Here.
Fine. Now complete this form and sign your name at the bottom.
Good morning. I'd like to pay my bill.
Ok. In cash or by credit?
In cash. How much is the total charge?
Five hundred and thirty yuan altogether including charges for service.
Here you are. Thanks for your wonderful service.
Not at all. Welcome again.
I haven't heard anything.
Deborah had her baby last week.
Nobody told me.
I thought you heard.
I really wasn't told anything.
She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces.
Wow, How exciting.
I know, You should really go and see her and the baby.
Of course I will.
I just wanted to let you know what happened.
I appreciate that.
Oh, No! I can't have failed. Are you sure?
I'm afraid so. I'm terribly sorry.
It sucks. But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience.
He's the only one of the several to decide this.
How am I going to face the fellows in our office? They thought I would be promoted. They must be waiting for my good news.
I don't think the thing can be that serious. You should face the result. Besides, I don't think the position is the best for you.
But I lost the chance.
Keep working hard, And then you will get another chance of promotion someday.
One to the beach. How much is it?
One dollar... I'm short of change this morning.
Sorry. I can wait a moment.
Good, Here's your ticket and four dollars change.
Thank you.
I think I can, Kate. It must be Karen Marsh, The actress.
I thought so. Who's that beside her?
That must be Conrad Reeves.
Conrad Reeves, The actor? It can't be. Let me have another look. I think you're right! Isn't he her third husband?
No, He must be her fourth or fifth.
Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!
She does, Doesn't she! I read she's twenty-nine, But she must be at least forty.
I'm sure she is.
She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl.
That was a long time ago, Wasn't it?
Not that long ago! I'm not more than twenty-nine myself.
It really depends on you.
But if you were me?
If I were you, I'd buy.
Hi. This is Taylor Wright calling. I'Ve got an appointment with Doctor Bell at 9. 00 tomorrow morning. I'Ve got to cancel this appointment. My father-in-law passed away suddenly last night.
I'm sorry to hear that. Cancelling the appointment is no problem. Thank you for your call.
Thanks a lot. Good bye.
This one. It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well. You may try it on.
That is nice. But I don't quite like the collar.
The collar? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai.
I don't care what others wear. How much is it?
250 Yuan.
Really? Too expensive. I don't think I can afford it.
But it is really worthwhile.
Ok, Anyway, Let me have it.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Give me five more minutes. I'm really tired this morning.
I'm sorry, But it's time for you to get ready for school.
I get that, But let me just sleep for a little bit longer.
You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep.
Believe me. I will get up and get ready in five minutes.
There's a lot that you need to do this morning.
I understand, And it will get done after I wake up in five minutes.
I would like for you to not be late for school.
I'm going to be on time today.
Go back to sleep then, But only five more minutes.
Thanks a lot.
This job pays sixty-five thousand dollars per year.
What kind of benefits does this job have?
This job provides full medical,Dental, And disability.
What type of vacation time do we get?
You get 3 weeks paid vacation that you may use as you wish.
Do we have a 401K?
We offer a 401K with some matching funds available depending on length of service.
What type of professional development do you offer?
We provide up-to-date training on state of the art equipment.
Where do I sign up for my benefits package?
Down the hall. I'll show you when the interview is over.
I am not surprised, You eat too much.
And I suppose sitting at the desk all day at the office doesn't help.
No, I wouldn't think so.
I do wish I could lose weight.
Well, Why don't you go on a diet?
I've tried diets before but they've never worked.
Perhaps you should excercise more. Why don't you go to an exercise class.
Yes, Maybe I should.
No, I am afraid we don't.
I'm sorry. The restaurant is full now. You have to wait for about half an hour. Would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available?
No, Thanks. We'll come back later. May I reserve a table for two?
Yes, Of course. May I have your name, Sir?
Bruce. By the way. Can we have a table by the window?
We'll try to arrange it but I can't guarantee, Sir.
That's fine.
Well, I prefer active rather than passive training. For example, I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin. They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice. All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room, So we could communicate with each other. We had a lot of fun learning together. It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues.
Well, That is also very efficient, Right?
Of course, It is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet.
That's boring. Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches, All of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video.
There's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes.
Which one is that?
The office. Have you watched it?
I've seen the British version and loved it, But have never seen the American version.
It's almost exactly the same. I think it's a hilarious show.
What are you watching now?
They're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now.
I can't stand American Idol! I think it's really over-rated.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Have you got satellite, Cable, Or digital TV?
We have digital TV. It's amazing though---even with 100 channels, There's often nothing on that I'd want to watch!
Do you watch a lot of TV then?
I guess so. I'm bit of a couch potato. How about you?
I don't have a TV at home, So I rarely watch anything. Is there anything worth watching after the office?
There's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch. Do you want to stay and watch it with me?
Why not? I don't have anything better to do!
No, Thanks. I'm just looking.
We have a special on these skirts this week. Would you like to try one on?
No, Thank you. I don't need any skirts.
How about a blouse? This one here is the latest fashion.
No, Thank you.
Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you.
No doubt. Look, I'm just browsing. If I need your help, I'll let you know.
Take a look at this dress! Don't you think it's perfect for you, Ma'am? Uh, Where are you going, Ma'am? Ma'am?
We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on. They are all phosphate-free, Which minimises damage to the environment.
What about the packaging?
We try to use as little packaging as possible. Also, All our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes. That's what our customers want.
What can I do for you, Kim?
I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll.
Sure, Anytime.
That sounds great. I'm absolutely starving! What kind of food are you in the mood for?
I'd love something spicy. Maybe we could get someSichuan Hotpot.
You're a woman after my own heart. I don't know many people who can handle spicy food. Are you sure you are up for hotpot.
Sure. If I could, I would eat hotpot every day!
Ok, You're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food, Aren't you?
Well, Let's stop dragging our feet and find aSichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner!
Let me think about it for a minute. Let's see... Oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue! Give me a second and it'll come to me.
Well...? Have you thought of it yet?
No...
Never mind. There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street. Have you been there?
That's it! That's the one I was thinking of! I told you I'd remember it!
You really have a bid head, Don't you!
I'm sorry, That's bad luck.
Sure. If you want to stretch your legs, A good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body, Like this. It's a very simple exercise, But very effective.
I need to excise my arms too. How can I do that?
One good way is to do push-ups. Another way is to use weights. Make sure you grip the weights firmly. You don't want to drop them on your feet!
When I do push-ups, Should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground?
You don't need to bend your elbows that much. Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle. The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight. Many people bend their bodies at the waist, Which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise.
What's a good exercise for my chest muscles?
One that I recommend is that you lie on your back. You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body.
So I need plenty of space for this exercise.
Yes, You do. Lift the weight up, Keeping your arms straight all the time.
Great. Thanks for you advice!
Yes, Could you cash these travaler's check for me, Please?
Sure. Please sign your name here... And here.
Ok, Here you are.
Thanks. How would you like them?
It doesn't matter.
Hello, Is there a room available?
What kind of room do you have in mind?
A twin room, Please.
Hold on, Please.... I'm afraid we're fully booked. The only room available at the moment is a suite.
Oh, I see. Thank you anyway.
Oh, Tom! I thought you were in Paris.
Just got back. Good to see you!
Good to see you too!
Thanks a lot. That's the favor I was going to ask you for.
The pleasure is mine.
Sure. We're on a pretty tight schedule, But we should be able to finish it just on time.
Are all of your team members on schedule?
A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems.
How have they decided to deal with that?
They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished. They've even decided to come in on the weekend.
That's true dedication. I'm impressed. When is it due?
We agreed that the deadline was next Friday.
Right. Well, Given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project, I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning, I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway.
That'd be very helpful. An extra weekend is all they really need. Thanks.
That's alright. Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline.
I will.
I know you have a tight schedule, So I won't take up more of your time. Have a good evening.
You, Too! See you tomorrow.
Hold on please... Yes, You are booked already.
Now I am afraid I can't get to the airport on that day. I want to change my flight for the 21st. Is that all right?
I am sorry. Flight LJ88 0n that day is full. What about 22?
Fine. Thank you so much.
Good afternoon, Mr. Brown. My name is Mrs. Anderson, Manager of the sales department.
Nice to see you, Mrs. Anderson.
Nice to see you too, Mr. Brown. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
What would you like, Tea or coffee?
I'd prefer coffee if you don't mind.
Is it your first trip to the Fair, Mr. Brown?
No, It's the fourth time.
Good. Is there anything you find changed about the Fair?
Yes, A great deal. The business scope has been broadened, And there are more visitors than ever before.
Really, Mr. Brown? Did you find anything interesting?
Oh, Yes. Quite a bit. But we are especially interested in your products.
We are glad to hear that. What items are you particularly interested in?
Women's dresses. They are fashionable and suit Australian women well, Too. If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable, We'll purchase large quantities of them. Will you please quote us a price?
All right.
I received some leaflets in the post from you, One of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies. Is that right?
Yes, That's right. We have just introduced the program, But it's very popular already.
I also read that if the customer is a stock investor, Which I am, It's possible to get additional benefits?
Right again. We can provide a tailored consultation service for you, Giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments.
What if I don't want to come in to the branch, Can I use the consultation service over the phone?
Certainly, Sir. Via phone or Internet, Any time, Any place.
Working. Why?
Well. I was just wondering if you would come by and give me a hand with the fliers for next week's party.
I'm sorry, Melissa. I really can't today. I'Ve just got too much going on. Maybe tomorrow.
What would you like to know, Mr. Green?
What working experience have you got?
In 2004, I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou. I started a sales representative. A year later, I was promoted to the position of sales manager. I had that job ever since, Which is just over a year now.
Oh, Good. Irene, Can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant? Don't you like your present job?
Frankly, Some part of it I enjoy very much, But I prefer something more professional. It happens that I have a friend working here in this company. She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant. I felt very excited at this news. That's why I'm here.
Yes. What can I do for you?
May I ask for a wake-up call tomorrow morning?
Fine, What time do you want to get up?
6:30. My room number is 305.
Of course. We can give you a call anytime you like.
Actually, I need two calls, One at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen.
Your wish is our command. Expect a call at 7, And another one at 7 fifteen.
Wait a minute! I don't like 7 fifteen, Now that I think about it. Change it to 7 thirty.
The second call is now changed to 7 thirty. Is there anything else we can help you with?
Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, Though, I'll call you.
We're here all night long if you need anything.
Congratulations! This is your first interview ever.
Thank you, But I'm nervous. I don't know what to do. Could you tell me what should I do before an interview?
Sure, You should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed.
Yeah, Besides my personal introduction, What else should I prepare?
You should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can. It is important to show that you've done some research into the company. The interviewers Wil.
Then what should I do when I'm being interviewed?
Smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you. Try to act natural, Let your personality, Ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview.
Are there any other things I should pay attention to?
Yeah, Wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual. That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression.
Yes. I'd like to change some money, Please.
All right. How much would you like to change?
Let me see. I think maybe 600 USD at least.
Pardon?
Six hundred US dollars.
I'm sorry, Sir, After 7.
But I am badly in need of the amount. Might I ask you to make an exception for me?
I'm afraid we cannot help you, Sir, Because that would be violating the regulations. I owe an apology for doing nothing about it.
It's just too bad. I have to leave it as it is, And thank you just the same.
To this place, Please.
Star Hotel. Ok.
How long does it take to get to the hotel?
About 20 minutes.
Here's the hotel.
How much is the fare?
That's 10 dollars.
Yes, Surely.
Do I have to pay extra charge for that?
No, You don't. It is free of charge.
Well, Then, Will you put this and that into doggie bags?
Certainly, Would you wait for a few minutes?
Thanks. Would you give me another favor?
Yes, What is it?
Some more Chinese tea for us, Please.
Sure, I'll be back in a minute.
I have had an incredible boss, Who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience. A-bout two months after I began working for her, She really let me spread my wings. She encouraged me to work independently, Because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment. So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day. Of course, I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports, Although she didn't specifically ask me to. Without her support and encouragement, I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time. But she was open to suggestions, So long as employees could back them up with research and facts. When I submitted my suggestion, She reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work. She then took my revised proposal to her boss. He was a more conservative type, But she lobbied him to try It for several weeks. He did, And it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change. I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs. And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described, I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone.
Just one second, Sir, And I'll give you your receipt. Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Sir, Did you enjoy your stay here?
Well, Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic.
I'm glad you enjoyed the city, Anyway. But please don't think too unkindly of us.
It's probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend. Nobody sticks around in the summer.
Really? Then, I guess I won't have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab?
Actually, You might because there's a big convention in town this weekend.
I'm not too worried about it. I always seem to find something.
It is a way to make a living, But beyond this it's a way of fulfilling one's development. It can prove your ability.
May I ask you why you left the job?
I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract. Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job. I want to seek better jobs.
Is it a Chinese New Year's gift or a birthday gift?
Well, It's a wedding gift.
Oh, I see. Let me guess... Something sexy for the new bride on her first night of marriage?
Basically. But I have no idea what to get! She's American and kind of...
Well-endowed? Don't worry. I have some bras with bigger cup sizes in the back.
I'm off today.
It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lucy.
I'm very happy to meet you. You're from the United States, Aren't you?
Yes, I'm from Salt Lake City.
I've been to Salt Lake City a few times. I really like your city.
I'm glad to hear that. I think it's the nicest city in the United States.
Oh, Dear!
What's the matter?
It's not what I asked for.
What's wrong with it?
It's not the right material. Or the right color. I can't possibly accept it.
This is a pity!
Thank you.
How many pieces of baggage do you have?
Three. Would you please help us take them to the hall?
Surely, Of course.
Yes, I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates Limited. I would like to see Mr. Smith.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes, He knows I'm coming. Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock.
I wonder if Mr. Smith forgot your meeting. I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p.M. Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place. Will you please have a seat?
Sure.
Yes, Mr. Mason. I just checked with our office manager, Ms. Terry. She said Mr. Smith briefed her on your project. She is just finishing up a meeting now. She should be with you shortly. Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting?
That would be very nice. Thank you.
Right this way, Mr. Mason. We can start with our front office. When Ms. Terry is ready, You may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor. There is a conference room already prepared.
Hello, Yes, I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you. Perhaps your new compound savings one? I already have a Current Account with you.
That's no trouble, Sir.
I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer, With stock market news, Etc. It sounds just perfect for me, As I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance.
Yes, That's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program.
What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on. I mean, Some days I buy and sell quite a lot. Some days, There's no activity at all.
For every transaction you make, A statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail, Or if you want to be double sure we can do both.
That's just what I need, Sometimes I'm pretty forgetful.
Really, What's wrong with it?
The computer doesn't work when I push the power cotton.
Oh, Do you use your computer often?
Yes, I don't know why it doesn't work this time.
Don't worry. Have you got receipt with you?
Yeah!
We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday. Ok?
Ok, I'll expected you around 2 o'clock?
See you then.
Your results are posted on the website. Just put in your password and you can see the exact numbers.
Are you saying that all my results were normal?
We always contact you by phone to come in if there is a need for follow-up.
How will I know what the results mean on the website?
The purpose of each test is given on the site.
Will the numbers mean anything to me?
The website will give you your results and then tell you what the normal range is.
Can I see all of my test results at once?
Yes, You can see every test for the past five years. You can compare them.
I feel like having somedumplings. Let's go out to eat.
No need! I know how tomakedumplings. Let's do it from scratch. Can you give me a hand in the kitchen? I don't think I can finish everything by myself.
Of course. What do you want me to do?
Just trim vegetables for cooking. I will cut up the meat.
I can do that. And I would like tomakedumplings later.
Yeah, You are my good helper, Steven.
Absolutely.
I would like to have a hamburger.
Did you want it with cheese?
I don't want cheese on it.
Did you want anything to drink?
I think I'm going to get a soda today.
What kind of soda can I get you?
A Sprite sounds good.
What else would you like?
Let me get a bag of chips too.
Anything else?
That's all.
I'm figuring out my budget.
What budget?
I'm making a shopping budget, So that I don't spend too much money.
How much money can you spend?
I can only spend $ 300 a month.
Why only $ 300?
I need to save the rest.
For what?
I need to pay my bills.
Your budget is a good idea.
I know. It's going to save me a lot of money, I hope.
Hello, Dana, This is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp. I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon.
Oh, Yes. Hi, How are you?
Great. Do you have a few minutes right now for me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company has to offer? It won't take long.
Actually, I'm really swamped right now and I'll be going into a meeting in a few minutes. Is there any literature you can send me?
Oh, Sure, I understand. I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size. Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions?
Let's do this. Since I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the material, Why don't I give you a call if I have any questions. Now, I'm really sorry, But I have to get going to this meeting.
No problem at all. I won't keep you any longer. I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there.
Sounds good.
Thanks for your time.
No problem. Bye, Bye.
Yes. But he is meeting a client.
Oh, That's too bad. I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital. She is going to deliver a baby. I must take the day off to go to the hospital. May I talk to him to ask for leave?
I am afraid not, But I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes.
Oh, That's very kind of you. Thank you very much. I've got to go.
Have you brought your student card?
I didn't know you have student tickets so I left them in my bag.
In that case, You have to buy two full fare tickets.
Here is the money.
I'm fine, Thanks. Just trying to get adjusted. It's hard to keep track of everything around here.
That's for sure. You're new, Too, Huh?
Yeah. I just got here a couple of days ago. How about you?
That's all right. We'll get used to it. Besides, It is quiet up there.
We're little further away from the street and traffic noise.
And there's no one living over us.
Is the place well-furnished?
Yes, It's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play.
What about the kitchen?
The stove and refrigerator are in good working order,
And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires.
Are the plumbing all right?
The plumbing seems OK, Too.
The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water.
And the sinks don't seem to leak.
The place is OK. Let's go there and have a look at it again.
Hey, Look. My admirer has struck again.
Another note? But how? I didn't see anyone!
It's an e-mail. It says, We need to meet. I'll give you a sweet treat. It's not what you think.
Uh-oh. He's heating up. What are you going to do now?
You know what, I think I know who my admirer is.
You do? Who?
Just so so. There are no exciting things for me.
I'll do it later, Dad. I must prepare the concert on Saturday.
Oh, Is it? You'll be making records next, Will you?
We hope so.
You'd better get on with your homework! You can practice on Sunday.
Oh dad. You don't understand at all.
I certainly could. You'll get exams next month.
I don't need it to play the guitar.
Oh, Don't you? God save me!
I'm sorry.
Er, Good morning, Yes, Er...
I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night.
Oh, Yes. Arm, Well, Could you tell me your name, Please?
Oh, Candida Fawcett.
Oh, Yes. Arm, Well, What exactly is it that interests you about the job?
Well, I just thought that it was right up my street you know.
Really,Mmmm. Arm, Well, Could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself?
Yes, Arm, I'm 23. I've been working abroad, I'm um...
Where exactly have you been working, Please?
I'm so excited.
What are you planning on doing now?
I'm going back to college.
What are you going to major in?
I haven't thought about it yet.
I don't want to see you back here.
You won't see me here again.
I don't think this place is for you.
I know.
I wish you luck.
Thanks. I know things are going to be better.
Ah, Hello. Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques?
Yes, We do. How can I help? I can give you a simple introduction, If you'd like?
That would be wonderful.
We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques, As they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world. They are certainly the most versatile.
But what if something happened to them? What would happen to my money?
As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us, You are covered. No matter if you lose them or they are stolen, We will replace them promptly. All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques. We will need that number if you need to make a claim.
Ok, I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques, Please.
Probably nothing.
You have to do something romantic.
Romantic? I can't remember what that word means.
Well, You have three kids, So you knew what it meant once upon a time!
Ha, Ha! Those days are long gone.
All right, Madam. When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store. I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent.
That is quite an achievement! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience?
I don't think so. I'll create further achievement in the future.
Have you received any honors?
Yes. I got the title of Advance Worker in 2006.
Do you have any publications?
Yes. I wrote a thesis entitled On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy and it was published in China Daily.
Oh, Hi. Thanks for getting back to me quickly.
Why did you call me?
I was calling about your son.
Did he do something wrong?
Your son was acting up in class.
What do you mean?
He was talking and causing a disturbance during class.
That's really not like him.
If you could just talk to him, I would greatly appreciate it.
I apologize, And I'll make sure he doesn't do that again.
Don't worry about it, But thank you very much.
Yes, I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name.
It's very thought-provoking, Isn't it?
Exactly. It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal.
So what do you think of the American fast food culture?
I think America really deserves the name of "fast food nation - as people can find McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States.
And everyone knows that Americans 'favorite food is the hamburger, Isn't it?
Sure. You see, Tom, Fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience. People just don't care whether it is healthy or not.
But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants...
What are they?
Such as fat-free milk, Whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich.
They're much better.
But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived.
That's the point. People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal.
Well, Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods.
I suppose so.
That was my fault. I'm sorry.
You messed up my car.
I don't see any damage.
My rear bumper is messed up.
I don't see anything wrong with it.
It's smashed in.
That's not my fault.
The same thing is wrong with your bumper.
I'll take care of everything. I just need your phone number and insurance.
I need your information too.
Here you go.
I want to apply for a passport here.
Ok. Please fill in these forms and take them back when you are done.
( 10 minutes later. ) Hi. Here are completed forms.
Ok. Can I have your original ID card and tw0 2 - inch photos?
Here you are, But I forgot my photos.
That is OK. We have photo taking service here. You may pay your fee, Take a photo there and take it back here.
Ok. I am going right now.
Yes. Thank you very much.
Now I come back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend, The pendant is broken, I'm afraid.
Oh, Is it?
Would you change it to a new one?
Yes, Certainly. You have the receipt?
Yes, I do.
Then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o'clock? We will replace it.
Thank you so much.
Yes, I need some more cash for my visit in China. May I cash a traveler's check here?
Of course. We would be happy to cash it for you.
I was going to cash it at the hotel, But one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates.
Well, Any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate, For which we're somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge. You see, Hotels really aren't in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler's check for their guest.
You mean there is really not that much of a difference.
No, Madam. Not very much.
Well, May I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each? I think that will be enough.
Yes, I'll be happy to cash these for you. Would you please countersign them here?
Ok.
Hello, Claire. This is Mick.
Mick! Nice to hear from you again. How are you?
Fine, Thanks. And you?
Oh, Not so bad. I've been very busy, But I'm going away on holiday soon.
Good. Listen. I'm phoning because I want to invite you to a party. At our Newhouse. And...
New house? Really?
Yes. We've moved. That's why we're giving the party. Can you come?
Well, That depends. When is it?
This Saturday evening.
Well... I'm going away on Sunday morning. Very early. Will the party go Convery late?
Until two in the morning. But you don't have to stay that long. Well? What about it?
All right. I'll come. But I'd like to bring a present Something for your new house. What would you like?
Nothing. I mean, Don't bring anything. It isn't necessary.
But I'd still like...
Just bring yourself! I'm looking forward to seeingyou again. It's been a long time!
Yes, It has. I'm looking forward to seeing you. Too. And your new house. Uh... When does the party start?
Come any time after eight. All right?.
Yes. Oh. By the W...
Bye! See you on Saturday evening.
Wait a moment, Mick. You haven't... Mick? Are you still there? You haven'tgiven me your new address. Hello? Mick? Hello?
I use several services. Of course, I deposit and withdraw money quite often. I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account. I use my bank to exchange money form once currencyt.
Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around.
I sometimes use traveller's cheques, But sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash.
Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills? I use direct debit.
Yes, I do. It saves me a lot of time. I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines.
That's good idea. You don't need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that. I suppose you have a mortgage too.
Yes. My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage. There's a lot of competition between banks nowadays. Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others.
I have a deposit account with my bank. There are some restrictions on withdrawing money, But the interest rate is much higher.
I don't have one. I prefer to buy shares. My bank also provides a share trading service. It's cheap and easy to use.
That's great. But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain.
Yes, What is up?
This is Susan. Would you mind taking charge of decorating the office for our Christmas party?
Sure.
You can get your supplies upstairs from Mrs. Horn.
Will I be getting any help?
You can ask Frank and Cathy to help you.
It's none of your business.
Mom said you couldn't go out.
I'm going out anyway. Get out of my way.
What kind do you want?
I need to get ground beef.
How many pounds would you like me to get you?
I need about four pounds.
Exactly what type of ground beef do you want?
Extra lean.
I'll get that for you right now.
I appreciate that.
Don't mention it, I'll just wrap this up for you.
Thanks for your help.
I am sorry, Sir. Can you tell me your room number?
812.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
The tap is always driving. I can't sleep well.
Ok, We will send a repairman to your room right now.
I'd like to have rest, But I have many things to do.
How about this post-trip?
It's very good, And the result isn't too bad.
Really?
Of course. I will write a report about this post-trip, And then you'd better type it at the moment, Ok?
Ok, It's no problem.
( Afternoon ) Miss Liu. Are you typing my report?
Yes, What can I do for you?
Nothing. I just tell you take care of it when you type, Especially the address and telephone number of those new guests. You should make sure that it's no mistaken.
Ok, Please don't worry about it. You should set your mind at rest.
Ha, I know you are great secretary.
Thanks your flatter.
Pleased to see you, Too, Mr. Brown.
You've had a good trip, I hope.
Yes, A very pleasant journey, Thank you.
It's been a full two years since we last saw each other.
So it is, I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years.
We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you. You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement.
I'm glad you're satisfied with our work. I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products.
Yes, We appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos. We can see you are experienced in this particular line.
Thank you.
But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative. After all, You sold around 400 pieces there last year. You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end.
That is the result of our hard work. Well, What annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then?
500 pieces.
No, No. That's too big a number to be acceptable. Let's put it at 450 pieces. And we'll strive to sell more, Of course. We wish to add another clause. For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota, We'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts.
All right, Let's fix it at 450 pieces then. And for every additional 50 pianos sold, We'll give you 1 % higher commission.
I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged.
We would like to make a specific mention of one more point. As our sole distributor, You will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins norre-export our goods to any other area outside your own.
No, Certainly not. That's a reasonable restriction.
Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products.
Yes, We've already prepared one. I've brought it with me. I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow.
Good, That's all then.
Good.
Yes, I think so too.
Do you have any other questions?
Let me think... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee.
I'm sorry we can't now.
I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live.
Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future.
That would work too.
Anything else?
Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees. Will this company do so?
I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee. We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company.
I understand. Will the company provide training?
Yes, We will, And the staff will have a chance to travel every year.
That's great. Thank you very much.
I'd like a table for two, Please.
Do you have a reservation, Sir?
No, I'm afraid not. Can I sit over there? There's a table free by the window.
Sorry, Sir. That table has been reserved. This way, Please. How about this one, Sir?
Fine. I'll sit here.
Would you like some drinks?
I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks.
Our softball team is in the finals! We're playing the McGrath office on Saturday.
Fantastic! I'll be there!
Operations is made up of Manufacturing, Materials, Shipping and Distribution etc.
It seems that it is a key department for providing materials and transportation.
Yes, It is.
I don't think you really want to hear about it.
It can't have been that bad. Go on and tell me about it.
To be honest, It was horrible! My manager is such a pain in the neck!
Why? What happened?
Well, He made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, My manager blamed them on me!
That's not very fair. What did you do?
There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, He would have fired me for sure.
Does he treat everyone in your department like this?
He treats everyone pretty badly, But the way he treats me really takes the cake!
Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others?
I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair!
Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company?
Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion.
That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders.
I try to be sensible about it, But it's not very easy. Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it.
That's so true. When you have a taste for success, You can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way.
I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week.
What about income? Did you make any money during that period?
My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period.
When you filled out your Continued Claim Form, Did you show that income?
Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form.
What happens is, When you make money, We take part of your benefits away.
I am not going to show any income from now on then.
I wouldn't do that if I were you. There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements.
Thank you! Guess how much it costs.
Bright colors, Smooth material, Exquisite craftsmanship, Soft lines... Darling, It looks elegant on you! It can't be any cheap stuff. Something around two hundred, I guess.
Your offer is way off the mark. It set me back only sixty-five.
Then you got a windfall! Was sixty-five the original price, Or did you get a special discount?
Neither. I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down.
How much did she ask for?
Three hundred! That's daylight robbery. How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me? Without hesitation, I gave my offer---no more than fifty.
She must be fuming with anger at such a bid, Wasn't she?
Not at all! She's really been around, And seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this. That's the trade. She only demanded a higher bid, Saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy. She was lying! Then I inquired, 'May I have it at sixty?' she waved her head.
Then you pretended to go without buying it?
Yeah. I turned around and started to move out. Just then, She yelped behind my back, 'all right, All right! I may sacrifice a little. Let's fix it sixty-five! Can't be cheaper.'.
Let's take a roundabout way.
Ok.
Look, Traffic jam again!
I am Mr. Foster, And we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people.
Welcome, Mr. Foster, If you would have a seat in the lounge area, Our hostess will be ready to seat you in just a moment.
We are going to have a drink while we are waiting. Please let the hostess know that she can find us there.
She will come and let you know when your table is prepared.
Those patio tables are new, Aren't they? Would it be possible to be seated out there?
An outside table is available right now if you would like to be seated immediately.
We would love to sit outside. Thanks for your help!
Here is your table, And now may I take your drink order while you are considering what to have for dinner?
Yes, Could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order?
I'll put your drink order in and be right back to get your dinner order.
We'll be ready to order by the time you get back!
Yes, I am Professor Clark.
Hello, Professor, This is Kalina, And I am in your literature class on Monday mornings.
Yes, How are you doing?
I was partying hard over the weekend, Fell down the stairs, And need time to recuperate.
That sounds painful. Are you going to be OK?
I sprained my wrist, But the doctor says it will be fine.
How many days will you be out of school?
The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week.
I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class. Get well!
Yeah? Why? Don't you like living with me?
Oh, It's not you. I just want my own place.
Well, Check the newspaper.
Jeez... I didn't realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days.
Yeah, Prices have really gone up the past couple of years.
Oh, Here's one. It's looks like its in this neighborhood, $ 600 a month. That's not to bad.
No, It's pretty good. Why not give the landlord a call?
Hello. I'm calling about the one bedroom in Lincoln Park. Could I take a look at it? Yes. Tonight at six is fine. Thanks.
Why? He did something wrong.
I know. But at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds.
I only wanted to help him.
But it is not the right time.
Yes, I would like to make a reservation for May 3rd.
For how many people?
Only one.
May I have your name?
John.
Let's have a look. Oh yes, You need a 10 mm ring spanner. Here you are. Just leave it on the workbench when you finish.
Thanks for your help.
No problem.
Oh, Nice to see you. The apartment is on the tenth floor. The previous tenant just moved out yesterday.
Could I have a look at it first?
Sure. Let me show you the way. Here we are. Apartment 1008. ( They enter. ) This is the living room dining room combination. Here's the kitchen. It's small, But fully equipped. The refrigerator is new, And the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old.
It's nice. So this is the bathroom. And that must be the bedroom.
Yes. And there's a walk-in closet.
Is there air conditioning?
Yes, There's central air conditioning and heating. The thermostat is in the living room。.
What's the house rent? When is the rent due? And how much security deposit do you require?
It's 600 yuan per month. The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month. We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit. It will be returned to you at the end of your lease.
I like the apartment, Mr.Sellers. You can show me the lease.
It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little. I firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world.
In what department do you wish to work if we hire you?
I want to work in the English Department, As I am an English major.
Well, There's no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section.
Right, So I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning.
Did you get a copy of the Herald too?
No, Why should I? The Globe's help wanted section is the best.
That's true, But still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn't have.
Not enough to worry about. Why do I waste the money buying two papers?
It's only a couple of dollars more. For that much money you can afford to risk it.
I guess you're right. I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe.
Good idea.
What did he say?
He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet, And could offer me an appropriate job.
What kind of intermediary is it?
It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses.
What job did he recommend to you?
It's on telemarketing.
Does he ask you to pay some fees?
No, He said the employers will pay for it.
Then what do you think about it?
I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try.
Sure, But you must verify that first and don't easily make a promise.
Of course, I will.
Good luck!
Did you bring your ticket?
Yes, I remembered to bring my ticket with me today.
Did you bring your ID?
I didn't bring my ID.
You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket.
What do you need my ID for?
We have to know that this ticket is really yours.
All right, I see what you mean.
Next time you come back, Bring your ID.
Will everything be cleared from my record?
Yes, Everything will be cleared.
Oh, Dear!
What's the matter?
It's not what I asked for.
What's wrong with it?
It's not the right material. Or the right color. I can't possibly accept it.
This is a pity!
Yes, Please. I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife.
What kind of presents do you want?
Actually, I don't know exactly. Do you have anything recommended?
Ok. How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, It won't cost you much. It's only around $ 59. 95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America.
Hey, How did you know I came from America?
Just a hunch, Sir.
How much again?
$ 59. 95.
That's really cheap for shoes like those. Ok, I'll take 5 pairs.
Sorry, Sir.
Why not?
Because in this duty-free shop, Your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife.
Oh, My God. I've totally forgotten about that. Anyway, I think she would like a bottle of perfume.
That's good. And I can also recommend you a good one. It's the brand of DENY.
DenY? That's very expensive in America. It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DkNY?
It's $ 60 here.
That's very unbelievable. Is it fake?
Of course not, Sir.
Ok, I'll take one.
Please keep calm. I know the pain isn't what flesh and blood can stand. But be brave.
All right, Doctor. But it really hurts.
To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.
I think that maybe I should accept their offer.
You, Of course, Have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up with another offer.
I want to make another offer, But I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house.
There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, But you could try one more offer if you like.
I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer.
After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with your offer.
Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me?
I don't think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer.
Who was elected?
Mccain won the election.
That can't be true!
I'm upset, Too.
I can't believe people voted for him.
People must want him as our President.
That doesn't make any sense.
I have more bad news.
How could the news get any worse?
I was only kidding, Because Obama won the election.
That's great news!
I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you.
I prefer Monday.
Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best?
Either one is OK.
Great! When I check with the others, I will send you an exact time. When you come, Be prepared to do your presentation.
I will be prepared to do my presentation.
Who would you like to see there? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee?
Everyone needs to be there.
That will probably be best. Do you need help with directions?
I think I know where it is. Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure.
Ok. We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow. Have a good day!
Please, Where do I catch the plane for New York?
First you must check in at Counter No. 4.
That one there?
That's right. Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85.
Thank you. You'Ve been very helpful.
Thank you. And here's your receipt, Sir.
Many thanks.
I hope your stay here was satisfactory, Sir.
This could be a great hotel, Once you get rid of the insects. The city itself is great.
I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit. Please have a pleasant trip home.
I was sick.
How were you sick?
I had a stomachache.
Did it get any better?
I'm still feeling under the weather.
Would you like anything for your stomach?
I took something earlier.
Get better.
Thanks a lot.
No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
Where is our waitress anyway?
Yes, The service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?
I'll walk over and get the bill, Since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon.
Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.
So the bill is $ 36. 00.
How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.
I agree, But we don't really know the whole story. There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control.
Let's leave 10 %, So that we at least leave something for the service.
I agree. We will leave $ 3. 60 for the tip.
Hello? Mr. Bernie. My name is Lisa. I hope I'm not disturbing you. I just heard about your daughter. I wanted to call you and tell you how much we'll miss her.
I'm sorry. I think you are calling the wrong person. My name is not Mr. Bernie.
What? That's odd. I'm so sorry if I'Ve bothered you.
No problem.
I'm afraid not. Don't you see I'm looking up a word in the dictionary?
I think you are flicking through it.
Well, Wait a minute.
I wouldn't call myself introverted. Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much. But other times I like sharing activities with others too.
What kind of personality do you think you have?
Well, I approach things very enthusiastically, I think, And I don't like to leave something half-done. It makes me nervous. I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished.
What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy?
For me, This would be having good relationships with my family members. My family has always been very close knit, And we still spend a lot of time together.
What basic principles do you apply to your life?
Working hard and being frugal are both virtues. I strive to practise these two virtues in my life.
I had meetings back to back all morning. And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office.
Not a good day. I hate to tell you that Mr. Thomas wants to see the profit's statement for new project tomorrow morning.
I can't believe it. I guess I'll be here until 10 again tonight.
What's wrong with it?
For some reason it won't turn on.
Have you checked the connections on your computer?
What connections?
There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet.
Will the cords keep it from turning on?
It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected.
I didn't think of that.
Try it and see if it works.
I think that I will, Thanks.
It should work, But let me know if it doesn't.
I'm pretty tired. I haven't been sleeping well.
Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep?
I have enough time. I just can't seem to fall asleep and stay asleep.
What time do you usually go to bed?
I don't have one time in particular. I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired.
Have you been under a lot of stress lately?
I just lost my job, And I am unsure about being able to find another one.
Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed?
I haven't ever tried that, But it sounds like a good idea.
I haven't gone to the interview yet. It's tomorrow. I am so nervous.
Don't worry. You should do fine. You have the experience.
I hope so.
Remember, They want someone who works well with people. You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are.
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
I'm pretty good, You?
I'm awesome.
How long have you been on the bus?
I've been on here for like, 15 minutes.
Do you catch this bus a lot?
Not much, I have a car.
So, You have your own car?
I sure do.
Then, Why are you on the bus with me?
I'm waiting till our President gets out of office, And the gas prices go down.
That's good thinking.
Yes. I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angeles on Sep. 19th.
Just a moment, Please. Let me check for you. ( A moment later ) Thank you for waiting. I am sorry but our flights are fully booked on that day. The next available flight leaves at 4:00 pm on 20th. Shall I reserve you a seat on it?
Yes, Please, Thank you.
You've drunk everything, Sir?
I finished it all.
Do you want the whole minibar, Or just certain items?
Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam.
That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, Sir?
The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, Please.
Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?
You know, Some grape juice would be really nice, Too.
Be patient for just a few minutes, Sir, And someone will be at your door.
Yes, I'm the manager here. What can I do for you, Madam?
Did you have the room checked before we move in?
Which room are you in?
1808. The toilet doesn't work properly. The water doesn't run in the shower.
I'm awfully sorry to hear that. ( After checking ) I'll turn to it right away. I do apologize. We'll change your room to 2002.
That's not bad. Thanks for your help.
It's my pleasure, Madam.
Both are superb in their skills. Anyhow, Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view.
You said it.
What's the specialty of the house?
The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good.
I like fish. Please bring me an order of that.
Do you want some dessert?
Apple pie, Please.
Single or double?
Make it two.
Hello. I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency. Is that possible at this counter?
Of course, Sir. What kind of currency would you like to deposit? And what is the amount you would like to pay in?
10, 000 Japanese yen.
Ok, Sir. Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit?
Fixed.
And how long are you depositing for?
For one year, That's what I usually do. Better interest, You know.
I certainly hope so. Can we arrange to meet on the 27th? That should give you enough time.
Yes, Sir. That's more than enough time. I do appreciate your understanding. Why don't we say 10:00 o 'clock on the 27th?
Fine, Mr. Tan. I'll see you then.
I suppose so, But don't rush. I've got to tell you how to do it.
That's very kind of you.
Yes ma'am, May I help you?
This is room eleven-seven and we have just checked in.
Yes?
Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet. So would you send one of your housekeepers to clean up our room?
Oh, Yes, Ma'am. We'll come right away then. Your room number and your name, Please.
Our room number is eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen.
Thank you. Would you hang up and wait?
What are you doing?
I'm getting dressed, What does it look like?
It looks like you are about to get dressed. Did you forget we are in a car on the road?
I'm good at this. Nobody will see anything.
Are you kidding? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking!
All right, Pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies 'room.
That will be my pleasure.
Sure. What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from?
It depends on the price, But I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend.
That will probably be quite expensive, But the more you pay for the fabric, The longer it'll last and the better it'll look. What color do you want the suit to be?
I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit.
Brown, Huh? Isn't that a bit dull?
Haven't you heard? Brown is the new black.
Why don't you just get black? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral, A wedding, A job interview — anything!
That may be true, But black is so boring. Anyway, I already have three black suits. I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest.
Here are two different shades of brown. Which one do you prefer?
I like the one on the left, But I don't like the pattern on it. It's too much. I want a pattern that's a bit subtler.
How about this one?
I think that will do. Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made.
Ok, Let's go.
I am quite alive and energetic. I am a curious person, And I like to learn new things.
Do you think you are introverted or extroverted?
I am quite outgoing, I think.
How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own?
I try to adapt myself.
Where are we? Oh, Here we are. So we drive to the A120 and turn left.
No, We turn right. Remember that we are coming from this direction.
Oh yes! Sorry! Then we drive to theM11 motorway.
How far is that?
It's only seven miles. We turn left to join the motorway and drive south.
According to the map, We get off theM11 at the second junction and join theM25. That's the motorway that goes around the edge of London.
That's another 15 miles, So that's 22 miles total so far.
Then we drive west on theM25. We must be careful to turn in the right direction!
Then we drive on theM25. It turns south. When we reach exit 15, We turn left and go west along theM4.
Then we take the first Heathrow Airport. What's the total distance?
The journey around theM25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport. So how many miles is that together?
22 miles to theM25, 33 miles on theM25, And 3 after that. That's a total of 58 miles, Isn't it?
It shouldn't take us very long to cover that distance. Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way.
We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn't much traffic. I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there. Being early is much better than being late.
Of course.
I would likesirloin steak and tomato salad.
Do you take dressing on your salad?
Yes, Blue Cheese please.
I have been doing quite well. As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 %. And I'Ve been awarded Zu Jingle Scholarship two times.
Besides your major, Do you know some in other fields?
Yes. To develop my knowledge, I studied Economics, Business Administration and Accounting through self-study. Nowadays, I have passed three courses on CPA.
Have you ever been a student leader?
Yes, I used to be the monitor of my class.
Did it affect you much?
It's a very important experience for me. First, It improved my organizing ability, And let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective. Second, It let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike.
For the past 5 years, I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co, Ltd.
What's your title in the company?
My title was Project Manager. There were almost 100 people under my supervision.
Thank you. I'll just print out your receipt, And then you're free to go. Here you go!
Thanks.
If you don't mind me asking, How did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel?
This hotel could use some insecticide, But my time in New York was thoroughly delightful.
That's very honest of you. Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time.
Sure. What do you want?
I want to tell you I've put in my notice.
Really? Why?
I've been thinking about this for several months, Well before the Spring Festival holidays.
And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision?
Yeah, After receiving my yearly bouns, I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market. I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received.
Absolutely. With your expertise and experience, You're clearly working below your pay grade.
That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one.
This way, You'll earn more at the new work place.
That's right. I am not the only one who has done this. Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry.
That is to say, Most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise. I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead.
All right. Which kind do you prefer?
I like one taken half length.
That's fine.
Please put your name and address here. May I see your passport.
Yes.
How would you like it?
Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please.
Ok, Here you are.
Ok, It so happened I want to buy one.
This microwave stove has many functions. Let me show you. For example, If you want to cook meat, You just need to put meat in it, And press the button with a picture of meat, That's OK. After several minutes, You can eat the delicious meat.
I think it's good, And it suits me, Because I'm not good at cooking. Is it expensive?
Oh, It is not so expensive. It only costs me 280 dollars.
Yes, I know. The boarding time on the ticket says 17:05, And now it's 16:15. I guess we have plenty of time.
Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in?
Yes. It's essential.
What about our luggage?
We can check it and hand carry the small bags. And we have to open each for inspection.
Are they going to frisk all the passengers?
I think so. We certainly don't want a hijack to happen on the plane today.
Very well. We have some fresh red roses.
How much are the roses?
$ 20 per dozen.
That sounds like a good deal.
Yes, They're on sale today.
I'll take a dozen.
Splendid. Will there be anything else?
No, The roses will be fine.
I'm sure your wife will love them.
Here are some biscuits. Why are you back so early today?
My teacher had a sudden stomachache, So the class was cut shot. You?
Me what?
You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual.
It's not for us.
Then it's for Dad, Isn't it? It's so unfair!
Don't be a smarty-pants. It's for Grandma Wang.
What was that again?
It's for Grandma Wang. She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago. So she needs our help.
I'm sorry, I didn't know that. But I wanna help.
Umm, Let me think for a moment. We can meet her together after I finish cooking.
I'll get knee to knee with her.
Good boy. I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you.
I was worried you would think it was too far to drive.
Well, It's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch. But really, I think it's worth it.
I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food, You might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer.
How do you mean "suffer"?.
I mean, In Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food. So we miss the food in Taiwan too much. Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better.
Even in the winter?
Yes, Even in the winter.
And even if it takes two hours, Huh?
Why not? I've been craving good food for three weeks now. I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza!
Well, This really is delicious, I have to admit. I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining.
Don't tease me! Good food is really important to Chinese!
I know. I can see that. This is what is called "dim sum," right?
Yes, All these dishes are different "dim sum" dishes. You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America.
So when you Chinese think of Chinatown, You mostly think of food. Is that right?
Of course. I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too. Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment.
And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner, After the museum. Chicago has some great Italian restaurants.
No way!
What do you mean?
We're going up to the "new" Chinatown for dinner. I already know where we're going to go.
Alright, Alright. I am happy to try more Chinese food. Will it be dim sum again?
No, Dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time, Or sometimes closer to breakfast. We'll try more Taiwanese style up at the" new "Chinatown.
Taiwanese style? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style?
No, Dim sum is more Cantonese style. But of course you can buy it in Taiwan.
I wonder if you can cook things this good.
I'm a great cook actually. You will see.
It's not that far. Do you see that Yellow building over there?
The big one or the small one?
The big one.
Yes.
It's right next to it, On the right.
Do you know if there's a convenience store around here?
I don't think there's one around here. The closest one is on 3rd street, But that's probably closed now.
I really need to get some things before I leave.
Well, You could go down to 22nd street. There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day.
Can I take the subway to get there?
Yes, But that'll probably take about half an hour. You should just take a cab.
Won't that be expensive?
No, From here I think it's only about 5 dollars.
Certainly, Mr. Robert. But can I have your plan?
Sure. Actually it's a routine board meeting. The things to be discussed are all written here.
Very good. May I keep it? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda.
Go ahead. It's for your reference. While you are at it, Make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes.
You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself?
Exactly. As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting, I don't want it to get out of control.
I see. Ok, Then where do you think we will have the meeting?
The conference room on the second floor, Is that ok?
Yes, I will see that the room is ready by Friday. And I will check there are enough chairs, And the lighting and air-conditioning are all right.
Good, And please get some water, Glasses and ash tray ready as well.
Sure, I will. What about the minutes? Do you think I am responsible for that too?
Definitely. The minutes have to be taken accurately.
But I am not familiar with the members of the board.
Oh, That's easy. I will write you a list of their names. You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number.
That's a good idea. All right, I'll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind.
The exact time? Let me think. You know, It happened at night.
But we need the exact time. What time?
Oh, I remember. It was about 10 o'clock. When I was about to go to bed, Suddenly I heard help outside.
Yes, I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl.
What kind of work are you doing now?
I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company.
Where are you working?
I work at Yangshi Trade Company Ltd. I have been working there since 1997.
No problem. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, And you're good to go.
That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, It's wireless only.
Hmm. Well, We have some alternatives, If you're interested.
Go ahead. I'm all ears.
We have a computer lab on the first floor.
That's great! How much is it?
It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, Of course.
Okay. What about the other alternatives?
You could use your wireless right here in our lobby.
Yes, That's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?
Well, We don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab.
What's the matter? Didn't you get enough sleep last night?
I fell asleep very late. It was almost two o 'clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep.
Are you worried about something? Why couldn't you sleep?
You know how it is when you're in a strange country. Everything is new, And you get tired and nervous sometimes. Then you worry about your family, About conditions back home, About your courses, About your money, About everything. I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind.
Well, Take it easy. Things will look better tomorrow. Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax.
Anything is worth a try. But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap.
So fast! Thank you.
You're welcome. This is my duty. Anything else?
Yes, You'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer, And then send those materials to each business worker.
Ok, I'll do it right now.
By the way, To tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us. Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip.
Yes, I get it.
Ok, It's no anything. Do what you should do.
I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you.
She'd better not start crying like she usually does.
I know, But she is going to miss you something awful. Have I told you how proud I am of you?
Dad, Now don't you go getting mush on me.
I mean it. You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world.
That means a lot to me Dad. Thanks.
We have great confidence in you.
Is that so? I didn't know it. Can I possibly borrow a jacket and a tie?
I am sorry ; you can't borrow a jacket and a tie.
Then we'll return to the hotel and come back, Will you change the appointment?
Certainly, What time will you come back?
At 7, Please.
How many in your party?
A party of 13.
Alright, We are waiting for you at 7.
How much is the fare, Please?
One dollar. Drop it in the box. Move to the rear of the bus. There are plenty of seats in the rear.
Wait. I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village.
That's right. Move along, Please. There are more people waiting to get on. Move to the rear.
I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue.
No, That's the number l that goes down Park Avenue. This is the number 2.
But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park.
It is. Get in. Please. You're holding everyone up. You can't miss Washington Square Park.
Would you tell me when we get there?
It would be better if you watched out for yourself. I might forget.
I read or go swimming, Go shopping, Usually. I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit.
Are you introverted or extroverted?
I wouldn't call myself extroverted. Sometimes, I enjoy being by myself very much. But other times, I like sharing activities with others too, Especially during these last few years.
What kinds of sports do you like?
I like almost all sports, And I enjoy both playing and watching. I especially like tennis and mountain climbing.
What kind of personality do you think you have?
Well, I approach things very enthusiastically, I think, And I don't like to leave something half-done. It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished.
You just ate.
I know, But I'm hungry again.
There's no food left from dinner.
I think I'm going to go make myself a snack.
Do you know what kind of snack that you want?
I'm not exactly sure.
Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something?
I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make.
A PB & J is pretty easy to make.
I'm going to do that.
Knock yourself out.
Just a moment, I'm coming. ( ten minutes later ). Now, What would you like?
I'd like to see the menu. Would you get me one, Please?
Yes, Certainly. Here you are.
Thank you. Ah! But this is in French. Would you mind giving me the English menu?
It's written in English too, In smaller print. There.
Thanks. I'll need a while to choose. Could you come back in a minute?
Right. ( five minutes later ) Now, What are you having?
I'm sorry, I haven't decided yet. Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes?
All right, But would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon? We're very busy just now as you can see, Sir.
Hi, This is Sharon in Mr. Reynolds's office. One of your delivery men picked up a package here about an hour ago.
Yes, Is there a problem? Ma 'am?
Well, It still hasn't reached its destination. I wonder if you could track it down for us. Mr. Reynolds is a bit concerned.
We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city. But according to our record, Your annual turnover is not too big, So I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency.
If that's the case, We can talk about it first. What's your concept of a big amount?
I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least.
I'm afraid that's too much for us.
We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us. However, Our company has the regulation for the agency.
All right, We accept the challenge. What about the commission? You know, We usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal.
I am sorry to say that it's a little higher. Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission.
You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries. At the beginning of our campaign, There is sales resistance to overcome, We must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs. A 20 % commission will not leave us much.
Our price is worked out according to the costing. A 20 % commission means an increase in our price. So, I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent.
Oh, That's pitiful.
Ok. I should have it finished by Friday afternoon. Then I can check those account over the weekend. We need to have them finished by Monday, Right?
That's right. We'll finish them just in time. The Macy project can wait for the time being. We need to spend several days on that project, But it isn't due to be finished until the end of the month, So we have plenty of time to get it done.
Some next week on, We should be in less of a rush.
I'm going to give everyone on the team an extra day off. Everyone deserves it.
Don't say that yet. A new project could suddenly appear.
That's true. Right. I'm going back to the meeting. It's been going on for hours and there's no indication that it'll end soon.
Carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work.
Good. I have to go right now. I really hope this meeting doesn't last too long.
They usually go on for ages.
I'll stop by if I have time later. Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines.
I will. Enjoy your meeting!
They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there. And you?
Hong Kong again. I would like to go somewhere different for a change.
Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around.
If you really want to learn, Remind me when you get back from your business trip.
You're on.
When do you leave?
I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth.
Tell me where you live.
I live in Altadena.
You can catch the 264.
It goes to the Gold Line?
Yes, It does.
What street do I go to to catch it?
You can catch it on Altadena Drive.
I had no idea that bus went to the station.
Yes, It does.
I'm glad you told me.
You're welcome.
Yes, I can. I have three years experience in operating computers.
What kind of software can you use?
I can skillfully use Dos, Windows.
Do you have any certificates on computer?
Yes, I have ACRE certificate, Rank 2.
Any other certificates?
Yes, I have a Cambridge Business English Certificate and Lawyer's Qualification Certificate.
Do you have any other special skills?
I like photography very much. I used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation!
That's right! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.
What does that mean?
Well, Basically if your heart stops pumping blood, Or your lungs stop pumping air, Then we need to get them going again! That's when we have to apply this procedure. Let's begin! I need a volunteer.
Me! Me!
Alright, Come here and lay flat on your back. Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing. We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times, Like this.
Wait, What are you doing? I'm a married woman! You can't just try to kiss me like this!
Madam I'm not trying to kiss you! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.
Well, Ok. But no French kissing!
As I was saying, We blow air through the mouth in this manner. Once this is done, We must try to get the heart going again. To do this, We place our hands over the person's chest, And press down firmly two or three times.
Wait, What are you doing! You can't just kiss me then go for second base!
Hi, David. You are very difficult to reach. I called several times. But I kept getting a busy signal. Is your phone out of order?
No, Not out of order. But we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line. I can't hear you clearly.
Ok. Let me call you later. Is that okay?
Sure. Thanks.
Certainly. Here you are. It's a new arrival.
Yes, I like the style. Can I try this on?
Sure. The fitting room is in the corner.
It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills.
Yes, I need to refill it today.
Alright. I'm sorry, Miss. According to our file, This prescription has already been refilled twice.
I was worried about that. I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not.
Well, It looks like you have. You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription.
Listen. This is an emergency. I tried to call my doctor, But he is out of town. So I can't see him in time. I need this medicine. It is for skin condition. I've run out. Can you just refill it once more?
I'm sorry, Miss. We can't do it. We must follow the prescription. And this prescription has run out.
But I need it. Please. Refill it for me just this once. I can go to the doctor around ten days from now. Then I'll have another prescription.
Miss, I understand your problem. But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription. It's the law. I can't do anything about it. We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription. Never.
But I have a prescription. I just need more of it.
A prescription must be valid. It cannot be an expired prescription. I'm sorry, Miss. It's the law. You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you.
Oh, It will be so expensive! I have a special medical plan, And I can only see one doctor. It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor.
Miss, I just can't help you on this. I'm a pharmacist, Not a doctor. And there are other customers I need to help now. I know it is frustrating when this happens. But there is nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry.
This is ridiculous! In Taiwan, It is much easier to get medicine when I need it.
Maybe that's true. I don't know. But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too.
I don't want to.
Well, Come over and talk to me then.
Certainly not.
May I turn on the TV then?
Turn on the TV, For what?
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music.
Listen to the music? And who will cook dinner, Will you?
I will, But let's go to the disco after dinner.
To a disco? Oh, No. You know I hate it.
I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes. Could you recommend me some?
Certainly. What about moon cake? It's typical Chinese food.
Moon cakes? What is that?
The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon. That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony.
Sounds very interesting. I'll buy some to family people.
All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles, Cantonese style and Suzhou style.
What's the difference between these two styles?
The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts.
Get me some of each.
Ok, Here you are.
The paper editorials always stick to the quick.
Don't you think it's a bit conservative?
After all, I'm somewhat conservative.
What's up? Honey!
Dad is bigger than you, But how come I'm smaller than May.
Honey, It doesn't matter. The key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other.
What should I do?
You go figure it out yourself.
Got it, Mom.
Ok, Ben and May, Here we go. Be careful, Danny, The ball is coming. That is the green one.
Mom, Don't worry about me, I can do it.
Danny, Back to your position. Move!
Ok. Bingo! We win. Give me five, Mom.
Which subway should I take to get to the East Side?
Oh, You have to take the shuttle to Grand Central.
Which train is that? Which platform does it leave from?
It's not on this platform. These trains are uptown and downtown, Not crosstown. You have to go up these stairs over there.
But of course! We have a great exercise facility.
Good. Now exactly where is it?
It's located right under our lobby. Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down.
Is this going to cost me anything?
No, Sir. The gym is absolutely free. However, Be sure to take your room key with you.
When does the gym open and close?
The hours couldn't be better, 24/7.
Very good. Now, Is there a trainer down there?
I wish I could tell you yes, But no, There isn't.
I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please.
Ok, Would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player?
Yes please. And I'd like to be able to make video calls too.
Of course I know.
Now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures.
Ok. I'll go right now. By the way, Do you think I'll have to stay in the hospital for long?
It's hard to say. It depends on your recovery condition. But you need to stay for at least one day for observation.
Thank you, Doctor. I will go now. Bye-bye.
Bye!
Well done, Fred. Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series?
Ok, Let me see. I suppose we must strengthen our promotion, Because our brand is still new to some consumers. Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously, Because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places. Besides, The advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products.
That is a good idea to start with. I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising.
Yes, The mass media has wider influence. One of my classmates works in an advertisement company. I can get help and inspiration from him. And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising, Such as on-line sales. Personally, I prefer to the on-line sales, For it is cheaper, Faster and wider.
Sure. Wait a moment.
This is Ryan you are speaking with. What can I do for you?
Hi, Ryan, This is Malia, And I will not be coming to work today.
What is wrong with you?
I have really bad poison oak and can't stop itching.
How long have you had it?
I'Ve had it a few days, But the rash really got bad last night.
How have you been treating it?
I have some lotion that the doctor gave me, As well as an antihistamine.
That should work. I'll see you tomorrow when you return to work.
Oh, Thank you. I'm looking for the train station.
Right. Let me see. You go straight down here and turn right.
Right? Ok, Got it.
Then take the next left then the next right. Are you with me?
Next left then right? Ok.
What's going on?
I want to discuss some things about my lease.
What aren't you too sure about?
Can you tell me when my lease is up?
Your lease is for three years.
If I ever decide to leave before the three years, Will there be a problem?
If you do, I will keep your deductible.
Why is that?
If you break the contract, Then you will not receive your deductible.
Oh, I see.
All right. I'm glad I could clarify things for you.
Anything wrong with it?
Yes, This is defective. See? I didn't notice this hole when I bought it.
Oh, I'm very sorry about that. You can change it for another one if you prefer.
If you have exactly the same one-same color, Same design, And same size, Of course.
This one is the same size and color. But the design is different.
What? What's the good news?
My son, Harvey just got into Harvard! He starts next September.
That's wonderful! You must be really proud of him!
I'm very worried, Doctor.
Oh? What are you worried about?
I'm afraid that I'm very ill.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think so?
Because I feel tired all the time, Even when I wake up in the morning. I find very difficult to do any work. I have no appetite. My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little.
How do you sleep?
Very badly, Doctor.
Do you find it difficult to get to sleep, Or do you wake up early?
Both, Doctor. I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five.
Are you worried about anything?
Well, Yes, I am. I'm worried about my work. I've just taken a new job. I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work. I'm always afraid of making a mistake.
I see. Please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch.
Yes, Doctor. ( The doctor examines the patient )..
Well, There's nothing very much wrong with you, I'm glad to say. You're working too hard and worrying too much. Do you take much exercise?
No, Doctor. I never have enough time for exercise. I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening. Then I can't get to sleep. Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep?
I can, But I'm not going to. You don't need medicine. You need advice. Don't work so hard. Too much work is bad for you. Don't worry about your work. It's silly to worry. Take regular exercise.
But I may lose my job, Doctor! It's hard to get a job like mine.
Then get an easier one, Even if you earn less money. Which would you rather have, Health or wealth?
You're right, Doctor. It's more important to be healthy than wealthy. I'll change my job. I'm grateful for your advice.
Come and see me again in a month's time. I think you'll be a different man!
Of course, Mr. Roberts. But, Could you tell me his extension number again? I haven't got all the numbers down yet.
Sure, It's 4-8- 7-2. Don't worry. You're doing a fine job.
Thank you very much. Mr. Roberts.
Thanks, Doctor. Is there anything I can take for this headache?
Some aspirin or Panadol should help. You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription.
Okay.
Goodbye, Randy. Take care.
Yes, What are your hours?
We open at lo.
Thanks lot.
Good idea. How much do I need to deposit?
For Agreement Savings, We ask for 100, 000 RIB.
And how do I withdraw if I need to?
You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account.
I'm sorry, Refresh my mind. What's different about a Type B Account?
With a Type B Account, It cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service.
My daughter. She is missing. I don't know where she is.
What dose she look like?
She has blond hair and blue eyes.
What was she wearing?
She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers.
When did you last see her?
I just saw her down the street. I don't know where she is. I don't know...
How long has it been?
Oh, It's been uh... Fifteen minutes.
Pleased to see you. Welcome to our company. I hope you have a good day.
Thank you. Can I meet my colleagues?
Sure, Come with me. Hello, Michael, This is Steven. He will be part of your team.
Hi, Steven, Welcome to join us!
I'Ve been looking forward to meeting you. I am new to the working world and would appreciate your guidance.
That's right. Just call me if you need anything.
That's great.
Well, As the other guys are still not in, I'll introduce you to them later.
All right.
I'm sorry, It was too cold, And my car couldn't start. I had one to the garage with the heater. I tried to call you, But you couldn't get connection.
Couldn't get connection?
Yes, Your number is out of service.
Really? I didn't know. Let me check. You're right.
So I couldn't get through.
It's a serious problem. I make expecting an important call. The theater is guilty. It supposed to call me this evening, And discuss my play. What were happened if they can't reach me?
Well, The only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service.
Well, As you know I was in Thailand last month, And I took a cooking class! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes.
Great idea! As long as I don't get food poisoning! So what is on the menu tonight?
Ok, For starters we have Tom Yam soup. It's a bit spicy, But really good!
This is delicious! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste!
Now this next dish is one of the most famous. Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam. It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato.
This is delicious! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting! I could have this everyday!
Ok, Now for the last and best dish in my opinion. This is called Pad Thai. It's stir-fried noodles with eggs, Fish sauce, Tamarind juice, Red chili pepper plus bean sprouts, Shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander. It's practically Thailand's national dish!
Wow, This is great! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious!
Want some more?
I'm stuffed!
No where special. I was just taking a walk.
What for?
To get a little exercise. I'm so out of shape.
Hey, I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week. It's great exercise and it's fun too. Why don't you come out and play with us?
That sounds great. Give me a call next time you guys play.
What's the problem?
My mattress was supposed to be delivered today.
Is there a problem?
The delivery people showed up four hours late.
I apologize for theirtardiness.
I was late for work because of them.
Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience.
I want my money back for the delivery.
Seeing as they were late, That won't be a problem.
It shouldn't be a problem.
I'm going to refund your money right now.
Here, Sir. Sit down in this wheel chair.
Thanks.
The doctor will be with you in a moment. I just need to ask you a few questions.
All right.
Name, Age and date of birth, Please?
James Taylor, 23, March 30, 1982.
Health insurance company and policy No?
I don't have it.
What?
I don't have health insurance.
Well, This is going to be a very expensive broken leg, Mr. Taylor.
Oh!
Don't worry about that.
Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble.
No trouble at all.
Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow?
No, That's quite out of the question.
Please accept my deep apology.
I never did like this MP4 anyway. I won't hear of it.
We have a fairly good working relationship, But there was also a rough spot.
What do you think his strengths are?
Well, He has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations.
I just went to bed.
You shouldn't stay up so late watching TV. I told you we had to get an early start.
I know, But that movie was just too good to leave. I guess I'll just have to pay the price anti-sleepy.
Do you want to eat breakfast here?
No. Why don't we describe and buy at the coffee shop next door?
Ok by me.
That's right. I'm glad you're here. It hasn't been working properly for the last few days.
When was it serviced?
Just a couple of weeks ago. It's usually very reliable.
What's actually wrong with it?
Well, It's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays.
I'm sure it's nothing serious, Probably just a minor fault. I'll have a look at it.
Just take it easy. If he starts to bother you, Let me know and I'll call security.
But what if he knows my name, Where I live...
Don't get all worked up over him. He's probably harmless.
Actually, He's really good-looking. Too bad he's a weirdo.
You never know. Maybe he's just an innocent, Lonely guy...
Now he's looking over here! He's coming!
Ok! I'll call security.
I should be coming in on the 11:30mooring flight. How far is the office from the airport?
Only 25 minutes or so. We'll send somebody to meet you. That's 11:30 a.M. Friday the 15th?
That's right. I'll be in the baggage area.
Right over here, Sir. What size do you wear?
Medium.
These here are all mediums.
Thank you. I think I'll take this one, And these pants as well. They're a present for a friend.
Shall I gift-wrap them for you, Sir?
Yes, Please.
Well, What seems to be the trouble, Mr. Williams?
It's nothing serious actually, Doctor. It's... Well, I get tired very easily recently, And I often doze off during meetings, Office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining.
How long has this been going on?
About two months. I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning, But you see, I got fired this morning. I dozed off while we were having an important meeting, Right in front of the boss. I was very embarrassed.
How was your appetite?
Pretty good, I'd say.
You haven't lost any weight, Have you?
No, Doctor. I've actually put on two pounds.
Unbutton your shirt, Please.
Well, Doctor?
You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure.
What examinations?
A blood test and during test. You can come back next week, Say 4 pm to see the results.
The thing is, I've got all of this information here, All of these leaflets, But I can't make head nor tail of them!
I see. What is it exactly that you are interested in?
I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit.
Well, That all depends on how much you want to invest.
I was thinking of around 10, 000 RIB.
That's a nice round figure to deal with! Ok, If you were to buy this insurance policy, Your yearly fixed income from it would be 94. 35 RIB.
And for the Savings Deposit?
For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more. You see, In time deposit, The interest rate is 1. 58 % after the 20 % interest tax. So, Technically you could get more than a third more.
Wow! A third more? Very good.
My name is Han Ran, Number is 050920.
What part of the country do you come from?
I'm from Living, Yunnan Province.
Where is it?
It's a very beautiful place in Southwest China.
Do you have a big family at your hometown?
Not very big. There are five of us — grandmother, Father, Mother, Sister and I.
Are you married?
No. I'm still single.
Exactly what?
All I get is a black screen.
What's the matter?
I think I know, Because this happened before.
What happened before?
My hard drive crashed.
Oh, No. That's bad news.
It sure is, But I'm going to call HP first, Just to make sure.
Will you lose all your files?
No, I always back up my files.
You're smart.
Did you call for a car service.
Yes, Are you engaged.
Not at the moment. Where would you like me to take you.
I am going to the airport, And I have to catch the 930 flight to New York.
Well, It's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway. I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour.
But I can't miss the flight. It's an important meeting and it's waiting for me.
All right, I will try my best. If there aren't any holdups, I think we can get there in time.
That's great. How much is it to the airport.
About $ 25, Tips not included.
Fine. Will you please help me with the luggage.
Oh, Yes, Sure. Let me put it in the boot.
Thanks very much.
Not at all. Bang the door, Please.
Ok, Let's hurry.
You are in luck. The traffic is not heavy today.
The supreme goal of ours is to be in the leadership in marketing.
Well, It is a really high target.
Yes. We can make great efforts to make it become true as long as we have a clear goal.
I'm not sure.
One of your brake lights is out.
Really? I'm sorry. I did not know that.
I'm going to give you a ticket.
Why can't you just let me off with a warning?
It's just a ticket.
How much is the fine?
The judge will let you know.
I have to be at court?
Of course.
All right. Just give me the ticket.
Yes! Thank goodness you're here. These bugs are driving us crazy!
What sort of pest are we dealing with?
We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything. We have termites in the wood, Cockroaches all over the place, And last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard!
Well, There's nothing we can't handle. I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, But the termites will be harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the entire house and fu.
No problem, Just get rid of the bugs!
Yes, I was in my apartment in Beijing. Where were you?
I was at home with my parents in New York City.
Really? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers?
I didn't see the crash itself, But I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents 'apartment building.
That must have been horrible. Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on?
No, We decided to stay in our apartment. With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt, Many people had no choice but to walk home. It was utter chaos.
Did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center?
Yes, My uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers.
Did he survive?
Unfortunately, He wasn't able to evacuate in time. He ended up dying in the tower.
I'm sorry. That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family.
It was. The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own.
Terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life.
Yes.
What's your name?
Jenny Madison.
What's your nationality?
Nigerian.
What is your date of birth?
15th of April, 1969.
And your occupation?
I am a painter.
What's your passport No.?.
7834623464 3367.
Where do you live in China?
In the Golden Mountain Hotel in Beijing.
You are suspected of smuggling. Do you understand your rights?
Yes.
Ok, Sign here.
Yes. Ms. Gray. Is there something wrong?
I'm afraid there is, Greg. I don't mind you taking a break. But you'Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already.
I'm sorry, Ms. Gray. I must have lost track of the time. I'll get back to work, Now.
Any particular decade?
Something made in the '20s would be nice.
We had seven, But we sold one this morning.
Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes?
You're in luck. Two of them have dancing figures.
Oh, These are great. I think I'll take this one.
Yes, That one is very nice.
Now, Does this come with a warranty?
I'm sorry, But you just have to take your chances.
That doesn't surprise me.
Even if it doesn't work, It's a beautiful collectible.
Sure. Can we use it in Today Supermarket?
Let me check. Yes, We can.
I really don't know what to buy.
That's right. I know it must sound crazy to you, But we believe there will be fewer absences this way.
We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year. Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help. It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me.
Right now, We have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible. But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues.
I see. So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work, Resulting in more sick employees.
That's right. If sick days were mandatory, Sick people would stay home. We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics.
Let's give it a shot!
I'm sorry I've already gone through my paycheck for the week.
Thank you just the same.
No. Go to bed right now.
I am just looking, Thank you... Excuse me. Can you tell me where I can buy a pair of shoes?
It's on the fourth floor.
Thank you.
I just had a complete physical examination and passed with flying colors.
That is good. We hope each of our future employees will be healthy and happy.
I understand that.
Yes, I once booked there. They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail. You can conveniently pay by credit card, So the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes. They also provide e-tickets, Meaning you don't need to go to any office to pick an air ticket. You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card.
So it has attracted more and more customers these days.
Yes, Therefore they are expanding the scope of their service. For example, Hotels can be booked through the same site as well.
You need to get a car tag first. There's a one hundred Yuan deposit for the car tag.
Okay. Here you are.
Thank you. We'll bring the receipt up to your room when we get it.
Good morning, Mr. Yang. Thank you very much. Can I work now?
Oh. Take it easy. As I'Ve said in the interview, Once you are employed, We'll give you a probation period of three months. And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period.
I am sorry, I am just too excited and forget it. Can I look it through?
Of course, Here you are. And you can ask me any question.
Well, I am sorry that I have a question. There is no remuneration item in this agreement. Can you tell me something about it?
Well, According to the principle of our company, Employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period.
But you didn't tell me in the interview.
I am sorry, It's not decided by me but by the company.
Okay, I can't decide whether sign or not now. Can you give me some time to think it over?
Okay. Can you give me a reply tomorrow?
Yes. Thank you very much. Mr. Yang.
Pardon, Where to, Sir?
I want to go to the financial stree.
All right. Hop in, Please.
Excuse me, How long does it take to get there?
It usually takes about half an hour.
Oh, Does it really a long way to go.
Yes. Moreover, Since the street is heavy with traffic this time of day. I'm not sure we can make it. By the way, Are you pressed for the time?
No, I'm not. You can just drive slowly and carefully.
Ok.
You are very skillful driver.
Thank you.
By the way, Is the fair the same for any distance?
No. It versa according to the distance, You can read from the meter.
Oh, I see.
I'm really sorry, Ethan. I tried so hard, But I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town. The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here.
What? I don't understand.
I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food?
Oh! Ha-ha! That's not what I mean when I said 'go Dutch'!
Huh? What were you talking about, Then?
' going Dutch 'means to split the bill,Silly!
Oath... That makes so much more sense! Ha-ha. Well, Great, I don't like German food anyway!
I'm in the mood for some chips and salsa.
Me, Too! The chips here are so light and crispy.
And they have tangy, Freshly-made salsa, Too. My mouth is watering already!
I'll go get the chips. What do you want to drink?
Surprise me.
No where special. I was just taking a walk.
What for?
To get a little exercise. I'm so out of shape.
Hey, I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week. It's great exercise and it's fun too. Why don't you come out and play with us?
That sounds great. Give me a call next time you guys play.
Let me see. Aredimes and quarters OK?
I want to make a long distance phone call.
Then you'll need small change.
Yeas, It is. Sewen Jes speaking. How can I help?
Actually, I'm calling to complain about your service. The computer I bought last week is faulty.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Sir. What exactly is problem?
Well, Easily, It doesn't work. It doesn't even start probably.
Oh, Dear! I'll do whatever I can.
What kind?
I want to open a checking account.
You need to keep a minimum balance.
How much is it?
You need at least $ 100 in your account.
Is that all?
Yes. That's the minimum.
What happens if I don't meet that requirement?
You will get a fine.
How much?
It's going to be $ 25.
It's Peter's turn.
Give themike to him.
Ok.
Be quiet. He is singing.
I thought he only liked to listen!
So did I.
He has a really good voice!
Yes, He sings wonderfully.
Hello,Miao Ping. It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary. You know, It's so annoying. I wish my company could just pay me in RIB.
Haha! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars.
Yes, I guess you are right. So, Do you need my passport?
Thanks, Mr Janus. Of course I trust you, But regulations are regulations.
Here you go.
Thanks. And of course, Could you fill in the exchange form?
Hi, This is Monica. I was wondering when we can work on this financial report.
Today, I am busy all day long.
Shall I see you on Friday morning?
That's not good for me at all. It'll have to be another time.
We must find some time to read report.
I know. I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon.
That's all right. Then see you on Friday afternoon.
See you.
Oh, Yes. I often went on business trips in the past six years.
How many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue?
I speak English and French in addition to my mother tongue, Chinese.
That's fine. What salary do you get at your present position?
My present monthly salary is $ 1, 500.
We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20, 000 a year, With bonuses that can add up to $ 40, 000. A company car, And a company pension scheme. Is that acceptable to you?
I think so.
Excellent. Well, Thank you very much, Mr. B, And you'll be hearing from us in the next few days, Either way.
Thank you. Mr. A, And I certainly hope the answer will be favorable. Goodbye.
Well, I want to go to the university flea market, They got times of books,Dvds, And a lot of nice clothing, Too.
How about we go to the yard sale first and then to the university flea market?
Good idea, Let's shop to we drop!
Yeah. There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes.
May I buy a ticket here at the station?
Sure.
Where?
Go to window number eleven.
Thanks.
What's your address, Sir?
I live at 323 Park Street.
Ok, Someone will be there by 12:15.
What are your rates?
It's 2 dollars initially and 35 cents for each quarter mile.
I have four very large suitcases. Will those fit in the taxi?
No, I'll send a larger vehicle to pick you up.
What kinds do you have?
Oh, We have quite a regular, Cold perm, Straight perm, Pin curl and foam.
Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent. Set the wave a little looser than usual, Please.
Of course you can. I am sure this one works very well. I just sent dozens of pages. How many pages are you sending? Are you familiar with my fax machine?
Yes, I think you have the same model as I have. Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol?
Yes, It will print immediately.
What do you need help with?
Do you know how to turn them on?
Do you have any change?
I need change for the machines?
You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer.
So what do I need to do?
The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot.
That's really all I have to do?
That's everything.
Thanks for all your help.
I'm here if you need any more help.
I wish to buy a diamond ring.
How many carats diamond do you want?
Two carats.
Is this one suit for you?
No, It seems too old-fashioned.
What about this?
Let me try it on, It's too small for me, Haven't you got any larger ones?
Yes, Try this one please.
This fits me well, How much is it?
3, 500 yuan.
It's reasonable. Here you are.
We are very glad to hear that. We are sure that there will be a bigger market for our products in this country.
Well, We have an extensive sales organization and a thorough knowledge of Asian market. Your products would sell very well here. We are prepared to do more business with you. We are also interested in handing a sole agent for you.
We really appreciate your efforts. Before we go to the core of matter, Can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent?
No problem.
That looks good. The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom, So you wouldn't be able to have all that furniture in your room.
I'd like to have the bed and the wardrobe.
You would fit both of them in your bedroom. Perhaps you could also get the dressing table. I think that one would look good in your bedroom.
Yes, It would. It's very expensive though.
Everything in this magazine seems expensive. You could probably find something similar in a discount store.
Yes. I'm sure I could find something similar at one. I'd also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom.
You can get cheap carpets easily. Another idea is to buy a rug. That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn't have to replace the carpet. It would save you a lot of work.
That's a good idea. I'm really looking forward to redoing my bedroom.
For 3 days $ 300, For 7 days $ 600.
Good. I think I'll hire one for 7 days.
Okay. I'll write up the paperwork.
Yes, I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries.
Would you like anything to drink with that?
Yes, A medium Coke.
Will that be all?
Yes.
For here or to go?
To go, Please. ( The attendant hands the customer his order. )..
That'll be $ 4. 25... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill. )... Out of five. Here is your change, Sir. Have a nice day.
Well, Not everyone wants to drink beer. Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice. Nothing's as refreshing asiced drinks on a hot day.
I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks. Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone. What about wine?
Just buy a cask of wine. Have you bought ice yet?
No, Once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice. The cooler, The better.
I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea. It's appetizing and tasty.
Well, If you say so. Personally speaking, I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne.
I'm going to the movie theater with my friend. What are you going to do?
I'm not quite sure yet.
How about you see a movie with me and my friend?
What movie are you and your friend planning on watching?
Not sure. Is there a movie out that catches your eye?
No good movies come to mind.
Have you decided whether or not you would like to go?
No, Thanks. Maybe another time.
For sure another day.
Sporting goods? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale?
Yeah, It's 30 percent off the regular price.
Well, Maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday.
Yeah, It's a couple weeks away, And we don't have anything yet.
Don't buy him underwear again. He hates that.
I know, I know, But if I didn't buy it for him, He'd never buy it.
See anything else we need there?
Well, All shoes are 20 percent off.
Shoes? You already have a closet full of shoes.
I know, But another pair can't hurt.
Oh, All right. I need some new shirts, Too. Let's go after breakfast.
Hello. Can you help me?
Yes, I'm here to fix your pipes.
Oh good, Come in, Please.
Don't tell me! I'm sure it's someplace warm and sunny with great beaches!
You got it! I'm going to spend two fabulous weeks in Hawaii!
You are so lucky! Send me a postcard!
Yes. I Would like make a reservation to Huston for tomorrow.
The flight to Huston takes off daily every two hours from 6:00 to 11:00 pm. So you don't need a reservation. Seats are available on a 'first come, First served' basis.
Oh, That's quite convenient. Thank you.
Well, I love hip hop dancing, So I should probably dance. Do you know how to rap?
Oh yeah! I'm a great rapper. And I know all the Vanilla Ice lyrics by heart.
Excellent. I'll start practicing my dance moves.
I'm great. Thank you for asking.
What can I do for you?
Do I owe any fees?
You sure do.
Could you tell me how much I owe?
You owe $ 235. 13 in fees.
I can't believe that.
When will you be paying these fees off?
I'll pay them off right now.
Cash or check?
I will pay with cash.
Yes. I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment.
Great. Could you tell me something about cash control?
Yes, Of course. In accounting, Cash means all items that are acceptable for depositing in a bank.
Forgive me, Sir, I haven't been told what the problem is.
I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!
My apologies, Sir. We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund.
Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court.
Sir, We never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.
Working for your company! As the top administrative assistant in your firm!
Good answer, Miss Zhang-good answer! Seriously, Though, Are you interested in staying in a staff-level position, Or would you hope to move into management someday?
Well, I haven't thought much about this. I think it's too early to tell. What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible. If the company is happy with my work, Then, I think I would like to consider other positions in the company.
Fine. What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees?
Well, A working relationship. I think a company is a place to get work done. Certainly friendly, Open relationships among all company employees is important. But I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss.
Which one do you mean?
The man with his hair cropped.
It's OK.
What did you do in the interview?
I observed the interviewer's manner,Mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine.
Are all these helpful for the interview?
Of course. The manner of shaking hands can show a man's character. For example, The interviewer who shakes your hand lightly, Is a easygoing man although he looks cool.
Anything else?
You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts, And can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture andmien.
Well, I'm very good with people. I'm honorable. I work hard. I work well under pressure. And I'm patient.
What kind of people do you like to work with?
I like a person who works hard. I don't like lazy people.
What's your greatest strength?
Well, This is a challenging question. I suppose I would say that I'm a quick learner.
So, You're smart.
I think so. I think that I am good at what I do.
What do you consider your weakness?
I'm not good at speaking in public. I feel uncomfortable when I speak in public.
That's not a problem. It's unnecessary for this position.
Well, You know the time of shipment means a lot to us.
I can understand, But our company is fully committed at the moment, And hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days.
I see. Ok, That's agreed then.
Irish coffee is my favorite. But I'm not particular on it.
All right. Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home?
Not very often. Making coffee is a bit troublesome. Most of the time, I just buy takeout at Starbucks. And also, I quite like instant coffee.
I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular. Though its taste is not perfect, It's really cheap and convenient.
Exactly. Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee. People love it all over the world.
I agree. I heard that in the western countries, Almost everyone likes coffee. Is that true?
Yes. No doubt about that. For us, Coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink. I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee.
No, We don't, Especially the elder people. But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays.
I suppose so. That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now.
What are you going to get?
I don't know what I want to eat.
Well, Do you want burgers, Chinese food, Or Mexican food?
Chinese food sounds good.
Where are you going to get it from?
I haven't the slightest idea.
I usually get my Chinese food from Panda Express.
You like Panda Express?
The food there is actually pretty good.
Maybe I'll go there then.
You should. I know you'll like it.
Why don't you try an Americano? Espresso with water.
Sounds a little weak.
Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee.
Sounds better, But I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head.
Don't worry, James. We'll get this case worked out in no time.

But it will be expensive to have a car in the city, Won't it?
Oh, I don't know. Of course, Gasoline costs a lot these days.
But what about parking? You can't park on the street, Can you?
A lot of people do. I'll try it for a while anyway, But I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets.
I don't think so. I'm just shaken up a little.
Maybe I'd better call an ambulance.
No, Don't bother. I think I'm OK.
Are you sure?
Yes, It's OK.
Yes. I booked a single room in your hotel for this Friday. But I'm sorry to say that I have to cancel it. My wife is very sick now. I don't think she'll be able to travel by this Friday.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

I don't like shopping in malls. I like shopping on the street. There is more variety.
Let's just look and see what they have.
Alright.
What about these shirts? Do you see anything you like?
The styles here are too boring for me. I told you. I like street shopping.

Well, The pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine, Which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it, Where most of the water is extracted.
So, Is it actually paper at this stage?
Yes, It is. But we need to take out more water. So it then passes through a series of rollers, Where more water is squeezed out. After that it goes through the dryers, Which are at a very high temperature. The paper is then coated. And finally it's wound ontoreels and cut down into smaller lengths.
Do you know how many you need?
I think I can get by with 2, 000.
We can get started as soon as you fill out this form.
I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards.
