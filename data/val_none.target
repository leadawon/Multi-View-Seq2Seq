Mike, Don't even think about it!
Ok. I just want to read the comics.
Take your time.
Fully agree. I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel. The latest office equipment is more type-functional. It combines fax machine, Copy machine and printer in one. It saves a lot of place, One machine instead of three.
Yes, This machine is even smaller than those before.
When will we get one of those?
You know our boss always trying to save the last penny. We have to use up the equipment first.
It leaves at 8: 30.
I see. Are there any seats available?
Just a moment, Please. Yes, You can have a seat.
Good. How much is a one-way ticket?
It's 38 dollars.
All right. Here's 40 dollars.
Here's your ticket and change.
Thank you. Which gate should I go to for the bus?
Go to gate number 2, Please.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
Yeah, Why, Is there something going on Thursday?
A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob, He's been with the office for ages, So everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement.
Bob is retiring, Wow... That's news to me, I had no idea Bob was that old, Retirement's still sixty-five, Right?
Retirement age is still 65, But I think more and more people are retiring earlier, I think Bob's in upper fifties already, He just looks pretty young.
Wow... I thought he was early forty stops, Why would he want to retire so soon?
Well, I think you prepare it well and capture good savings, Retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities, You should get out and enjoy the life you still can't, Don't you think?
I'm just looking.
Then take your time, Please.
Thank you.
I don't like it very much. But every-body likes their own food best.
There are many things I miss. You can't get the ingredients here.
Are you sure? All the big cities have specialty shops, Which sell all sorts of ethnic foods.
Perhaps. I just haven't had time to find them yet.
There's a bookstore just across the street.
They are reports of our company.
Are they filed alphabetically?
No, They are filed according to dates.
Can you find last month's report for me, Please?
No problem, Here you are.
Yes, Certainly. I'll be back in a minute. Here you are.
Thanks. Let me see. I think there's a mistake on the bill here. Would you mind checking, Please?
Of course, Not. Let me check. Oh, You seem bo be correct.
How about tax and service charge?
Only ten percent tax is included in the bill.
Then one hundred U.S. Dollars covers everything, Doesn't it?
It sure does.
You mean, What's happening? Well, Constable, I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me.
Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door?
Well, You see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry. Come on, Fred, We're wasting time.
Just a minute you two. I don't think you're telling me the truth. This isn't poorhouse, Is it?
No, It's my brother's. I'm staying with him for a while.
Is he at home?
I'm afraid not. He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment.
He's awful! He telephoned me four times yesterday, And three times the day before yesterday. He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon. My boss answered the telephone.
What did your boss say to him?
He said, Pauline is typing letters. She can't speak to you now! "Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening. He telephoned again. But I didn't answer the phone!
Did he telephone again last night?
Yes, He did. He telephoned at nine o'clock.
What did you say to him?
I said, This is Pauline's mother. Please don't telephone my daughter again!
Did he telephone again?
No, He didn't!
It goes all the way there.
Are you sure?
I know it does. I catch this bus a lot.
How long does it take for the bus to get there?
The bus ride is only thirty minutes or so.
Where do we get off the bus?
Right behind Macy's is a bus stop.
The stop is really at the mall?
It's in the middle of the parking lot.
That's perfect.
I know it is.
Where do you need to catch this bus at?
All the way up on Las Flores Drive and Fair Oaks.
I can tell you what bus to catch, But you have to walk a little bit.
Walking isn't a problem for me.
The 267 stops at Altadena Drive and Fair Oaks.
Which direction do I want?
Get on the bus heading west.
Do you know where I get off at?
Del Mar and Hill.
Thanks for letting me know, Home-girl.
No problem.
I suppose we can bring him to visit our company, As well as our display room. In this way, He can know more about our company and our potential power. In my opinion, Visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much.
En, You are right, And he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon. But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret. On one hand, Show his our best side ; on the other hand, Do not show too much to protect our own business secrets.
Well, I understand.
Please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon.
Nothing but the best, Cinnamon toast.
What a nostalgic food!
Why the drama? Have you been watching soap operas?
No. Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown...
Brings back memories?
I had planned to. I can bring some from my place. And there's some more at my parents '..
Do you have a bed?
Of course, I have. There is one in my old house. And I have another one from college at my parents 'house.
That's good. You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room.
Yeah, It is a good idea. You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to.
Yeah. By the way, Can I take a shower?
Sure, But I don't have hot water, Yet.
Really?
No, They're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on. My phone should be working then, Too.
Well, Do you want to go outside for dinner?
Yeah, I can't cook anything until tomorrow, Anyway. Let's go to the restaurant nearby. It's my treat.
Ok. Let's go.
The exact time? Let me think. You know, It happened at night.
But we need the exact time. What time?
Oh, I remember. It was about 10 o'clock. When I was about to go to bed, Suddenly I heard help outside.
It's just around the corner.
Don't feel like it. I'm broke.
Well, We can still do some window shopping, Can't we?
Just look around? Ah, That's boring.
I'll go myself then.
I'd rather say it's confusing. What are those "strict nutrition philosophies" about?
I believe they are careful calculations on proteins, Vitamins and calories.
Probably, Iris. That must be the job of nutritionists.
Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves. So we are free to have whatever foods we love. It is unbelievable.
Oh, Believe it or not, I came across an article the other day, Saying that pizza is a healthy food.
Seriously?
Yes, I felt exactly the same way as you did just now. Scientists must be crazy in saying so.
Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet.
Absolutely. I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great. As long as I have enough energy, It's fine.
But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body.
Oh... I mostly just like to listen. You're the groom. Why don't you go first?
Ok. Put on something by the Backstreet Boys!
How about As Long as You Love Me? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke!
I'd better not. Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys!
Thank you. I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users.
Hah, As the sale department director of our team, You are the best.
I am flattered. But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it. She asked me to her office.
Why not? You've done so well for the company. She should give you a prize.
I feel nervous when I face her. She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time.
Come on! What are you nervous about?
It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation.
But the sale number is close to the predicted amount.
I'm still nervous. I don't know what to say to the manager. I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place.
Take it easy. Be confident. I'm sure you can do it.
Yes. I have just got lost with my firiend. Can you page my friend for me?
Ok, Tell me your friend's name.
Here is his passport. Thank you very much.
Make sure that you understand the company. Do you understand what it is that they do?
No, I probably need to do some more research.
When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed. Does that make sense?
I think that their attitude is rather casual.
So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear. Do you have something to wear?
I have absolutely nothing so far.
You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it, But can we talk about other basics?
Yes, Where should we go from here?
Focus on being relaxed and open, Don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about. I'm sure you'll do well.
I'd like to buy a toy car for my son.
How about this one?
It looks nice. How much is it?
They're three hundred dollars.
Oh, I'm afraid it's too expensive. Can you show me something cheaper?
Ok, This one is one hundred and twenty. It's the cheapest here.
Ok, I'll take it. Here's the money.
Thank you very much.
Frans Smith? I think you may have the wrong number.
Is this Taiwan 8234342 2,Ds engineering?
It is. But there is no Frans Smith here. Do you know which department he works in?
The accounts department, I think.
The accounts department, No problem. I'm just putting you through now.
I found it a garage sale once.
What a find! So, How much does it cost?
Well, Because I like you... Ninety bucks.
Ninety dollars is pretty steep. I'll take it for sixty bucks.
I'm looking for the cameras.
They're in Aisle Two.
Is your boss coming by?
Right! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p.M.
Okay. Get back to your work, And call me back this evening.
Okay, No problem. Bye!
Bye!
Wait a minute. I think we have missed an important point. We should include an arbitration clause in the contract.
I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation.
I hope so. Too. But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us.
All right. I agree with you. But where do we hold arbitration?
I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country.
It sounds reasonable. The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way. If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation, The disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties.
Ok.
It's a ETV palace! I'm glad I brought my platinum card.
You won't need it. Stanley, My best man, Is going to treat everybody!
Where is Stanley? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV, Wasn't it?
If it were up to Stanley, We'd have the wedding in the ETV! He loves to sing.
Then I bet he's really good!
Well, Uh, I'll let you decide that for yourself. He'll be here a little later. Here's our room!
Yes, They are the latest designs. Would you like to try them on?
I want to try on this pair.
The round shape pair?
That's right.
I think it suits you well.
I agree, How much?
120 yuan.
It's not expensive. Ok. I'll take them.
Do you have an appointment, Mr. Liu?
No, I am afraid not. I just arrive in town today.
Mr. Thomas is quite busy, I'm afraid he won't be able to see you today.
Would you please ask when he will be free?
Have a seat please while I call.
How did you do on your driving test?
Passed.
That's great and it was your first try.
What did I do? I haven't done anything.
You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs.
What do you mean?
You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs. So we are taking you into custody.
I didn't do anything.
We've found some heroin at your house.
No, I didn't. I'm innocent. Those aren't mine. Whatever you found is someone else's stuff. You can't prove anything. I wasn't there when you went in, And you can't prove it's my stuff.
That may be, But you're still under arrest. And you'd better stop talking.
I don't need your help, Jerk.
Whatever you say.
Yes, We are thinking of placing an order. However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms, Including mode of payment, Discount and possible date of delivery.
We supply washers of all types and sizes. We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers.
We have read about this in your sales literature. Could you give us some idea of your prices?
Our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in Europe or anywhere else. Here are our latest price lists. You will see that our prices are very attractive.
Do you take special orders? That is, Do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients?
Sure, We do.
How long does it usually take you to make delivery?
As a rule, We deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C. It takes longer, Of course, For special orders. In no case would it take longer than six months.
Good. One more thing, We'd like you to quote us on CIF basis.
Okay. No problem.
6 500 yuan. You will get it on the price tag.
Its a little overpriced. Is there any discount on this laptop?
Its already very cheap. Let's make it 6 000 yuan.
I'd buy this if it were cheaper. How about 5 000 yuan?
Hum... I say 5 500 yuan. That's as cheap as it can get.
Is it the final price?
I'm sorry, This is our rock bottom price.
Alright, I'll buy this one.
Just a minute. I am as busy as a bee right now... Ok, I am done. What can I do for you?
Well, I seem to be a little bit lost here. I am worried that I'll never find my way. What's worse. I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now.
Well, Keep you chin up! I'll try to help you. Where are you going?
I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Yes, No problem. You walk down this street. You turn left at the first intersection. Walk along that road, Turn right at the corner. After that, You make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light. The Royal Hotel is on your right side.
Great. Are there any landmarks nearby?
Yeah, I think so. I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office. It is as plain as the hump on a camel. You can't miss it.
Oh, That's good. I should be able to find it pretty easily then. Is that far from here?
Yeah, It's gonna take you a while if you go by foot. I'd say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk. You have to be as strong as a lion to make it.
Oh, That will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry. Can I take a bus there?
Well, You could take a bus there, But you would have to transfer buses twice. A taxi would probably be a lot quicker.
All right. I guess I'll take a taxi then. How long will it take by taxi?
Not too long. It should take about ten mins by taxi.
Cool, Thanks.
You are welcome.
Yes. Can you show me the menu, Please?
Of course. Here you are.
Then, What's special tonight?
Our seafood is fresh. I recommend shrimp with garlic.
All right. We'll have some seafood and vegetables.
I'd be glad to. Just leave them on my desk. I didn't expect you to finish so soon.
Thank you, Sir. I'll leave them here. If there are no problems, I'll mail them out this afternoon.
Great. Good work.
But it's raining.
Are you looking for somewhere for two people?
Yes, We are. Obviously, We'd like something as cheap as possible. We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month.
Yes, There are several place available in that price range near the university. Do you have any other requirements?
Net really, No. We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street.
How many rooms do you need in the flat?
We'll need two bedrooms. The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined.
Ok. I've got a list of place that fit your requirements. Let's just go through them. The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month, But it's on a noisy street and it's a little far fromt.
How far away is it from the campus?
It's about two miles away. That might be a little far to walk. Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus. The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street, Just off a.
That sounds ideal. Can we go to have a look at it? We'd like to see it before making a final decision.
Of course. I'm not very busy at the moment. If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes. I can take you there.
Thank you. That would be great.
You are just a little bit chubby, Not paunchy.
You know, I'm a compulsive overeater. I got to watch what I eat.
More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down.
You said it.
Unfortunately, He has left for the day.
I hate to trouble of you. But it is urgent. Please leave this message into him.
I'll make sure he gets the message.
Yeah, I went. Did you go?
No, I didn't feel like it.
That's nice, Have you been to the movies lately?
No, But that was a random change of subject.
It may have been random, But have you?
I haven't lately.
I would love to catch a movie this weekend.
So then, Why don't you just go?
I don't want to see a movie by myself.
Okay, So are you going to school tomorrow?
I think I might just go to the movies.
Sure, But let's get a pitcher this time. We should be able to down it before they close.
That sounds good. You order the beer while I go to the bathroom. Where is the can in this place?
It's all the way to the back. See that yellow door?
Yeah. I think I can find it.
You're back already. That sure was quick.
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around. That bathroom is too gross for me.
Well, The bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer. Anyway. He said it was too close to closing time.
Let's leave then. I could take some fresh air, Anyway.
Okay, Let's go!
Oh. I am sorry, Here you are. May I suggest our lunch special?
Could I have a few more minutes?
Of course. I will be here minutes later.
I ran a virus scan on your computer, And it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked a virus.
Well, You have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly. Yours wasn't up to date, That's probably what was causing your problems.
Ok. Anything else?
Yeah, Try not to kick or hit the computer!
Um yeah. Sorry about that.
Ok, Sir. How many people are there in your party?
8. Is your VIP room big enough for 8 persons?
Of course.
It's not my fault. Daniel always sends things flying.
Yes. I have been a data entry operator for three years.
What kind of software can you use?
I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos. Actually, I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages.
Do you have any other computer qualifications?
Yes, I have an ACRE certificate, Bank 2.
Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information?
I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information, But I'm sure I could learn quite quickly. It can't be too difficult, And I've got a quick mind. I can handle any problem you give me.
Tell me about it. If I was as small as her, I wouldn't think about going on a diet.
Me too. But what are we going to do? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight.
That's because you don't exercise. If you were more active, You wouldn't have a dieting problem.
What do you know? You are over weight too.
I'm not on a diet though.
I know. But I don't have someone to diet with. If we help each other and motivate each other, Then I think we can lose some weight.
I like ice cream too much though.
C'mon. You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there.
It does sound appealing.
It's a great idea. I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier. Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed.
Okay. I'm in. Let's do it.
Great. I'll get our plan started right away.
Can we start tomorrow though?
Yes, It is. What can I do for you?
I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission.
Are they urgent, Please?
Yes, The deadline for applying is 1st Feb, So I hope they will arrive in 3 days.
Well,DHL is famous for its speed and reliability. It is the fastest international postal service available. The document will arrive in two or three days.
Really? But can you guarantee the safety?
Yes, I promise. Your document won't be broken or lost. All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier. It is reliable.
Ok. I will send them now.
Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them.
All right. Here you are.
This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express. You can also check your post on our web. The post number is on the top of the receipt.
Thank you. I have got quite clear idea of it.
What's the matter?
I heard that we will call at some ports on the way. Is that true?
Yes.
Where will we call at?
Dalian.
Dalian is my hometown.
Really?
Can I get off the ship and walk around?
Sorry. I'm afraid you couldn't.
Don't worry about it. I have his pager number right here.
Really? You'Ve helped me a lot. Thank you.
Forget it. It's nothing.
Yes, It is almost new here.
Is it a color TV or a black and white TV?
It is a color TV. You know, The rich people like the digital one now. So they have no room for them.
Ok, Please be seated. May I have your name, Please?
My name is Woody.
Ok, Woody. Why are you interested in this job?
Because I admire your company. Yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city.
Have you worked anywhere else before?
Yes, Five years ago. I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai. Two years ago, I came to Beijing, And worked in a department store as a salesman.
Ok, Your work experience is impressive, And I think you sound right for this position, But I do have 3 other people to interview, So you'll be hearing from us within a week.
Thanks.
Yeah, I don't have to pay for a space on the street.
Really? How long did it take you to find a spot yesterday?
Well, Last night it took me half an hour to find a spot when I came home from work.
You get home late, Don't you?
Yeah, Around seven. Most of the street parking is gone by then.
Ah, Well. You can't have everything.
Yeah. I can live with it. It's great to be living alone.
Fair tomiddling. A little hard to appreciate.
You see, I have these Euros, And of course they are of no use to me at the moment. So I'd like to save them in my account, But I'm not sure how to go about it.
Ok. We offer 2 types of saving systems, Time Savings and Demand Savings. With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time, But with Demand Savings your money is 'on demand', You can withdraw at any time.
I see. What's the interest like on those?
There's quite a large difference. I mean, If you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0. 13 % interest, But for a time deposit, Of say, 1 year we would offer 0. 82 %.
Yes, I couldn't agree with you more. A 1 year time deposit it is!
You're welcome.
It looks delicious.
Well here. Help yourself to some shrimp. It's fresh.
We are interested in this field.
Please inform us of your decision as soon as possible.
Good morning. What time is it now?
It's just nine o'clock.
I'm on time today.
Yes, You're on time. Are you often late?
Yes, Quite often.
You must leave home earlier today.
No, I left home at 6:30 as usual.
Why are you so early today?
Because the traffic is not crowded.
I need to make a deposit.
Are you depositing cash or a check?
I'm depositing a check.
Please sign the back of the check.
There you go.
Do you want cash back?
Yes, Please.
How much cash would you like?
I want $ 150.
Here's your $ 150.
Thank you, And have a nice day.
This weekend.
Please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment.
Don't worry about that. We have experience.
Yes.
Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates. What insurance rate do you suggest we should get?
Well. Obviously, You won't want All Risks cover.
Why not?
Because they aren't delicate goods and won't likely be damaged on the voyage. FPA will be good enough.
Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average.
That's right. On the other hand, A WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases.
Are there any other clauses in marine policies?
Oh, Lots of them. For instance, War Risks,TEND andSICC.
Well, Thank you very much for all that information. Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now?
Are you going to make an offer today?
Yes. My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates.
Ok, I'll get this rate right away.
Thank you.
Certainly. ( Take a table-cloth to her )..
How much is it?
A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan.
That's reasonable.
If you take good care of it, It will last you quite a number of years.
Really? I'll take it then.
Would she like a laptop?
That sounds like a good idea.
A Mac is a very popular brand.
She mentioned a Mac. How much is it?
A 15 - inch Pro model is $ 2, 100 plus tax.
That sounds like a great price. I'll take one.
This is a gift she'll cherish for years. How do you want to pay?
I'll use my VISA.
We're almost through. Just sign here, Please.
Just take it home and plug it in?
She'll be online 20 minutes after she opens the box.
She's going to be so pleased with this.
Remember us for all your computer needs.
Yes. My name's Mark Benson. I just started a couple of weeks ago.
Well, If there's anything I can do for you, Let me know.
Thanks, I appreciate that!
I need to know how much money is in my account.
I'll need your name and account number.
Certainly.
Nothing. It's just one of those days. Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done.
Maybe you need a vacation or something, Or maybe a bonus.
I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right.
Why don't you talk to your boss about it? If you talk to him, He will surely understand.
I wish he could understand. You know what, If this goes on, I think I will get stick like everybody else.
A compact please. What's the daily rate for that car?
Thirty dollars a day.
Does the rate include the cost of gas?
No, You have to pay it by yourself.
That's good to hear. You've had an ideal recovery from your operation. We're going to send you home tomorrow.
Do you think I can get back to work very soon?
Don't be in such a hurry. I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks.
Is there anything I should do?
You'd better have a good rest for a week. Be sure to have regular meals. Stay away from alcohol. Give up smoking at least a little while.
Should I take some medicine?
Yes. I'm going to give you some. Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals. For that one, Two tablets. And remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks, Please.
It's very kind of you.
You're welcome. We wish you a speedy recovery. Goodbye.
Yes. I have no plans.
Would you like to Come to our barbecue?
Yes, That sounds wonderful.
Ok. See you then.
But wait, Wait, Will there be food that is not meat? You know. I'm a vegetarian.
Hey! I didn't know that! When did you become a vegetarian?
The other day, I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian. And you know what? I don't miss the taste of meat.
Relly? That's amazing.
Yes, It really is. After having vegetarian diet. I have much more energy, I need less sleep, I feel calmer. I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly.
Are you kidding? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet.
Yes, Maybe. But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian. Maybe you could also have a try.
Maybe I'll also have a try some day, But I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat.
Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet.
We'll see. Anyway, I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue. See you then!
Just say the word, Sir.
Excellent! Now, As you know, The day has barely begun.
I agree. The dew is still on the grass.
I want to hit a few more places in the city, But I need a place to put my luggage.
We do have a storage space for your bags. There's a small charge, Plus a deposit.
Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?
Regrettably, No. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit.
Hmm. I'll have to think about this for a second.
Okay, Sir, But don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.
China Hotel.
Why don't you take a taxi? It'll get you there much faster.
Well, I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change.
Before 12 a.M.
I see. Thank you.
Sure, Company rules are not very strict at this point.
Thank you for telling me that.
But remind you, There are some forbidden activities.
What are they? I'll be careful.
Don't use office phones for personal matters.
I got it.
Never ever come to work drunk, Also smoking in the office is not allowed.
I see.
Good heavens! Don't bring that frog in the house.
Yes, I'Ve nearly finished, June. I'm sure we will win something this week.
You always say that, But we never win anything! What will you do if you win a lot of money?
If I win a lot of money, I shall buy you amink coat.
I don't want amink coat! I want to see the world.
All right. If we win a lot of money, We shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels. Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country. We will have a beautiful.
But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again. What will we do then?
If we spend all the money, We will try and win the football pools again.
It's a pleasant dream, But everything depends on if!
Just a moment, I'm coming. ( ten minutes later ). Now, What would you like?
I'd like to see the menu. Would you get me one, Please?
Yes, Certainly. Here you are.
Thank you. Ah! But this is in French. Would you mind giving me the English menu?
It's written in English too, In smaller print. There.
Thanks. I'll need a while to choose. Could you come back in a minute?
Right. ( five minutes later ) Now, What are you having?
I'm sorry, I haven't decided yet. Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes?
All right, But would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon? We're very busy just now as you can see, Sir.
I want to check in.
Have you made a reservation?
No, I want a double room. By the way, Is there any discount for children?
Yes, Children are half price.
Ok, Please have me arrange one.
I usually just have a bowl of cereal.
The most important meal of the day is breakfast.
Yeah, But I don't usually have time to eat a big breakfast.
You can always make an easy breakfast.
What do you make?
All I make is oatmeal, Toast, And some orange juice.
That sounds pretty good.
I like it, And it's a fast meal.
That is a very quick meal to make.
I can make it for you if you like.
Oatmeal and toast sounds good to me.
Hello, Mr. Jones, Its...
Yang Tang, Just call me Fred! Everyone does.
Ei, Ok, Er .. Fred. Thank you for seeing me today.
No problem. No problem at all. Say, It says here in your resume you studied in California. Great place, Isn't it? I studied in California myself. I really enjoyed it. What did you like most about California?
Well, I... I guess the weather. And the people. They were all very friendly to me.
Yeah, The people are quite relaxed... Those were some great times I spent there. Well, Thanks for stopping by. Are you from KingDao, Yang Tang?
Yes, I am. I was born here, And still live with my parents in the same house.
Is that right? Wonderful, Wonderful. I've been in KingDao for two years now. A great place. Nice people and great beer! Well, I guess we'd better get started.
Hello. I'm having a problem with my air conditioner.
Which air conditioner?
The one in the bedroom.
What seems to be the problem?
There's no cold air coming out.
May I have your room number, Please?
512.
Ok, We'll send someone up to check it.
I'm going out right now. But that's all right, You can come when I've gone.
Fine. The housekeeper will open the door and stay in the room with the repairmen.
Yes, I'm looking for Bob.
He's in a meeting with Phil.
No problem, I can wait.
Yes, Ms. Ross? What do you need?
I was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation. I want to enter a Master's program in marketing. It's all on weekends and evenings.
Good news! I'll be glad to. When do you need it?
Hi. I would like to get an internet plan for my house.
Of course. We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from. The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month. This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps.
I have no idea what kbps means. I just want to be able to get online, Play games and chat with my friends. Oh, And watch movies online as well.
Well, This connection might be a bit too slow for your needs. I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes. That way you can play games online without any lag. This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free!
Do I have to pay an installation fee?
Lucky for you, This month we aren't charging our normal installation fee. You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there! And we'll throw in this pen drive!
Awesome!
Hi, Sandy. It's Walter Knight. I need to book some time with Mr. Crane.
Certainly, Mr. Knight. When would you like to meet with him?
Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday?
For the past 3 years, I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited. I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths. I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member.
Why are you interested in this occupation?
It's always been my dream to be a stewardess. And I like travelling to different places.
What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess?
Well, A stewardess should be friendly, Courteous, Patient and treat passengers kindly and politely.
Do you get angry easily?
No, I know how to control my temper.
If a passenger had a accident, What would you do?
I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time.
If you are hired, When can you start work?
I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now.
What are your salary expectations?
I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary. I'd like to postpone that discussion until later. Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works.
For a batch of 6, 000 we would charge two dollars a doll. Your total cost would be $ 12, 000.
That's a little steep for our company. Do you offer any discounts?
Well, We'd like to work with you. If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little. Can you increase your order to 15, 000?
Hmmm. It wouldn't be easy, But if the discount makes it worthwhile, We can consider it. How much of a discount would that give us?
For order of 12, 000 or more we charge only $ 1. 5 a doll. Your total cost would be $ 18, 000.
So, For an additional 6, 000 dollars, We get twice as many dolls? That still might be a little hard. Couldn't you discount it further? We'Ve been pricing other suppliers, And this discount might.
We do value your business. I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 %?
I think we can handle that. Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow.
That's no problem at all, But could you fill in this and I'll need to see some ID.
Here you go. Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in?
Yes, There needs to be at least 1 RIB paid in to open a new account. Also, You will need to choose a secret identity code to ensure no one else can enter your account.
Ok, How long does it need to be? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers.
Just 6 digits.
Things are going well for me, Dr. Smith.
Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical?
Yes, I am applying for new health insurance, And I need a physical examination to qualify.
Your basic physical exam will include lungs, Heart, Blood levels, And eyes, Ears, And nose.
I'Ve been having a little trouble breathing. Would you look into that, Please?
We can do an allergy test, And later I can send you for an asthma test.
I would appreciate it. When you give me a blood test, What are you looking for?
I am going to check your cholesterol, Blood sugar, And white blood cell count.
I am expecting the tests to go well. I have been taking good care of myself.
Coming. What do you want today?
Quite a lot. I need one pound of potatoes, Three pints of milk, A dozen eggs and one pound of tomatoes.
Our fruit is very fresh today. Do you want some?
How much are the lemons?
Three for ten cents.
Give me a dozen lemons.
Anything else?
No, Thanks. How much in total?
Twenty eight dollars.
Hello, Mr. Lie. I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company.
That is excellent, Your investment proposal is a wise decision. May I have some idea of your suggestion?
I suggest that we set up a board of directors for the management of the company and share rights and obligations as equal. That is very important.
Well, There does have one. Walk along the road and turn left when you come to a bystreet. It will lead you to the back gate of the park.
Thank you very much. Is the back gate open now?
I don't think so.
Yes, Of course. Do you like a jade necklace?
No, But I do like jade bracelets.
Here are all kinds of jades. Choose whatever you like, Please.
Thank you. ( A moment later ) Oh, This one is quite impressive. I'll take it. By the way, Do you sell pearl earrings?
Yes. Natural pearls or cultured pearls? We have both kinds.
I wonder which looks more lustrous.
Well, Natural pearls are of higher value, But the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful.
Oh, I see. I think I prefer a natural one.
I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive. Here is our offer. All the prices on the list are firm. If your order is a sizeable one, We could reconsider our prices.
Good. Is there any commission included? We are commission agents.
As a rule, We don't allow any commission. However, As an encouragement for businesses, We will allow you a 3 % commission.
Ok. How about the earliest possible shipment?
By the coming September.
Could you make an offer on FOB basis?
Certainly!
Don't you have any luggage to check in?
No, Sir.
Do you have a seat preference?
I'd like an aisle seat. I feel terrible near the window.
Here is your boarding pass. Have a nice day.
Is it urgent? Would you like the express service?
No thank you. I'd like to send it just by normal post.
Yes, Sir. Did you call the airline?
Yes, I did. But I couldn't communicate with them in English. They speak only Spanish. So I need your help.
Certainly, Sir. What is the flight number and when are you leaving?
We are taking IB 385 to London tomorrow at 1 p.M.
Oh, I see, Sir. We have the airline office inside the hotel. They have an English-speaking staff. Just dial 35, Please.
Yes, They have been concerned about me finding a job.
What do they say?
They want to recommend some jobs to me.
Really? What jobs are they?
My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company.
It's great!
My aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now, And she wants me to give it a try.
This is a good opportunity.
One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview.
You can give it a try! May be you will succeed.
I know. Let me think it over.
If you have any good jobs, Keep an eye for me!
I will.
Great. But no talking, Now. Don't forget that you are on a ladder. Take care!
But you are holding it for me. Nothing to worry about. I trust you. Oops, What's that?
Don't touch it with your stick. It's a bumble bees 'hive. Get down the ladder. Be quick.
What would happen if they started attacking you?
You can get killed. No kidding. Remember, Never stir up a hive.
I see. Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket?
It's for fun. And also, The apples here are Green Food.
Come on, Daddy. You can see that people only pick the red ones.
Silly boy. Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals, Fertilizers, And pesticides.
Oh, Then what would happen if there were pests?
I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests.
Cool! Well, Let's go over there to join mom. I want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method.
Here you are.
Will you please put your luggage on the scale?
I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself.
Sir, Your bags are 30 pounds over weight. You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage.
Well, Then, How much do I owe you?
That comes to H. K. $ 120.
Sure he can. He can shake hands, Roll over, And even play dead.
I wish I had a dog. My cat can't do any tricks.
Yeah, But sometimes Bingo wants to play with me, But I don't have time.
So who takes care of him then?
My little brother likes to play with him. He even gives him a bath every week.
I can't do that with my cat. She hates water.
You know, You're right. Maybe you should get a dog.
Yes. Let's go Dutch.
No. It's on me this time.
You are always so hospitable.
Yes, What style do you prefer?
Show me the black one, My size.
Ok, Here you are.
Well, I don't think it matches my jeans. Can you give me some advice?
Very well. You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package, Too.
Great. How much is this going to cost?
Well, It depends. Do you want to send it via priority, Express or standard mail?
What's the difference?
Well, Standard mail can take up to fifteen working days. Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days. Express is the fastest, But it's also the most expensive. It only takes three days and you can track your package online.
I see. Well, There's no rush. Please send it via priority mail. Please be extra careful, The contents of the package are fragile.
I am. What can I do for you?
I've something urgent to tell you.
Come on in, Please.
I don't feel so good, Mom.
Lily, If you're acting sick just because you want to play hooky...
No, Mom. I'm really sick.
Oh, That's a nasty cough. Let me feel your head. You're on fire!
Well, How long will it be?
I'm not sure. But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can.
Ok. We'll wait.
Sure. Where do you want to go? Are you in the mood for anything in particular?
How about somedumplings? I just can't get enough of them.
Dumplings again?! Oh, Amy, Let's try something new!
Well, What do you have in mind?
How about the Mongolian hot pot?
Oh, It's too spicy for me. Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb? It Was so spicy my eyes teared up!
Maybe we can try 'Yuanyang pot' this time. You can choose the non-spicy soup base.
Sounds great. Do they serve noodles? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well.
Yes. The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines.
Great. Let's go!
Wait a minute. Let me throw on a sweater.
I like feature films best. How about you?
I don't like feature films. I think sometimes it loses contact with reality. I like to see some documentary films. What kind of feature films do you like best?
I always like to see the oldies, Like The Sound of Music, Gone with the Wind. They are realty the best - in the acting, The scene and the plot.
You are sort of romantic.
16 hours. Beijing is 16 hours ahead.
Are we losing or gaining a day on the way to America?
We are gaining a day.
So does it mean we're arriving on the same day?
That's right.
Sorry, I can't! I have to go to work, Pick up Jake and Maddie from school, And make them an afternoon snack, Then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.
You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, And run some errands.
Oh, I don't know... It's hard to find the right nanny. You have to consider her previous work experience, The responsibilities you give her, And how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, Though.
I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, And you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, Before they moved away. She's very responsible, A good cook, And great with kids.
Oh, That's great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I'll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, And Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.
Yes, We are almost ready to order.
Let me remind you of the specials of the day, Which are posted on the board.
Oh, That all sounds so good! Can we get the sauce on the side?
Yes, We would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs.
I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices.
Yes, The roasted vegetable salad is good, And the portabella mushroom burger is also a good choice.
I think that I would like to order the broccoli noodles, Please.
That is an excellent choice, And I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner.
Please bring our salads to us now. We are hungry!
Yes, Of course. What is it?
I've decided to leave.
Leave? Why?
I've worked here for two years. And I want to do something different.
What do you mean by something different?
I want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language.
I'm really sorry. But I understand.
Thank you, Manager.
Yes. What can I do for you?
I am calling to query about some of your information.
We've got a bad line. Can you repeat that please?
I said I want to ask about some of your information.
Sorry, The connection is terrible. I'll call you back because I can't hear anything.
Well, I'm here to get some help from you. I was hoping to have someone who we can deal with exclusively. On a long-term basis, If that's possible.
What we can do is to assign you a customer manager, That way you can just deal with him. You don't need to deal with anyone else.
That sounds perfect.
Yes. What size are you?
I am a size 6.
Try this on please.
This is just my size. How much is the rent.
The rent is 400 yuan a day.
I want to buy a hat.
Come here, Please.
Is this one fit for you? It is nice.
I don't like the style.
How about this one?
Black is not my favorite colour.
You must like this pink one, Don't you?
It's pretty. How much is it?
Fifty yuan.
It's too expensive. Can you come down a little?
How about forty-five?
I'll buy it if forty.
Ok.
Yes, I'd like to try the blueberry pie.
Excellent choice. ( He brings her the pie. After she finishes, The waiter comes back. ) Would you like anything else?
No, I'm stuffed. I'm ready for the check.
Here you are. Thank you and have a nice evening.
Thank you.
Ok. What do you think of it?
I think it fits you. It flatters your figure.
I think so. But can I try another one? I don't like the color.
Can you point out your mother for me?
Ok. She's near-sighted, With a pair of glasses on her nose. She is the only one wearing glasses in my family.
I feel itchy! I can't stand it anymore! I think I may be coming down with something. I feel lightheaded and weak.
Let me have a look. Whoa! Get away from me!
What's wrong?
I think you have chicken pox! You are contagious! Get away! Don't breathe on me!
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy! We can't be sure until I see a doctor.
Well in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn't get it when I was a kid and I'Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!
Are you serious? You always blow things out of proportion. In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.
Your company has a very good reputation, And I have been planning to visit it for a long time. What's the advantage of your factory over other plastics ones?
Our production speed is almost twice the industry-wide average. And we've already expanded the factory this year.
Could you tell me the cost of production per unit?
I'm not familiar with that part. Let me call someone in charge.
Rather nice.
What was the weather like in New York?
It was raining when I left New York.
Thank you. I am glad that you are enjoying it.

I grew up cooking. My mother shared her recipes with me.
I especially like the wonderful chicken dish.
That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish.
Is that shrimp in the soup?
Yes, Do you like it? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables.
I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal.
Yes, Thank you for bringing the wine. It really complements the meal.
It's my pleasure.

We'll offer you a monthly salary to begin with, In addition, We offer one percent commission and all your sales. You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance. What's starting salary would you expect here?
They sum my skills and experience. I'd like to start it with 4000 yuan a month.
That sounds reasonable.

Ok, Well, We're going to make a pan of lasagne, A salad, And some garlic bread. Here's the recipe. Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard?

That's a good idea. Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius?
That's a bit high for lasagne. I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there.
Fine. I'll just get out the casserole dish, The saucepan, The salad bowl, And the baking sheet.
You know, I could do this myself. Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better?

Yes, Here you are. Would you care to order now, Sir?
I'll have the baked salmon.
Any vegetable?
I'd rather have broccoli.
Ok. Can I serve you anything else?
Yes, I'd like another cup of coffee.
All right.
Thanks. Try not to work too hard while I'm away!
Yeah, I'll try not to! See you after Christmas.
Okay-bye! Have a nice Christmas.
That's right. Let's go into the details.
Ok. I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep. We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales.
Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year, Right?
But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec. 25.
Well. I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment. Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment.
I hope you'll try to get them to step up production.
As new orders keep pouring in, The workers are working three shifts to step up production.
If that's the case, There is nothing more to be said.
I am sorry.
What's your last word as to the date then?
I said by the middle of Oct. This is the best we can promise.
All right. I'll take you at your word.
Good. Let's call it a deal. We will do our best to advance the shipment, But your L / C should be opened early Sep.
I promise.
That's good. Thank you.
Here we are. I hope you will like it.
It's good. It's a nice room.
And here is the menu. I'll come back soon.
Thank you.
I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month.
I think your background and experience are worth the compensation.
Does it include bonuses?
No, There are annual bonuses, One week paid vacation a year, And health insurance.
Very good.
We have made a lot of improvement in packing. You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom. I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done.
Quite good. The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste. How are you gonna pack these blouses?
We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it. Inside we'll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show. You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.
Wonderful.
Sure! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called, And ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.
Ok, So can I say, "This is Abby's voicemail. I will call you later, So leave me your name and number"..
That's more or less the idea, But try something that sounds more friendly.
Ok, So how about this, "This is Abby and I am really happy you called! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, So please leave me your name and number. Talk to you soon!"..
A little too friendly Abby. Just say this, "Hi, You have reached Abby. I am unable to answer your call right now, But if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks"..
That's perfect! Can you say that again and record it for me?
Yes, It is. It has some really good articles in it.
I know. I have been a subscriber for the past two years.
I didn't know that. How much does it cost to subscribe?
I'm not exactly sure, But it's not that expensive at all.
I used to subscribe to it, But I cancelled my subscription last year.
Why did you do that?
I was the only person in my family reading it. Everyone in my family just likes to read Fashion.
It's the same in my family. The coffee table in my living room is covered with copies of Fashion.
I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight. You really need to stop smoking. That's the main reason you're unhealthy.
I guess you're right. I've tried stopping, But I just can't seem to quit.
Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day? How many do you smoke each day now?
I smoke around 30 each day.
Ok. So for one month, Reduce the number you smoke by one a day. At the end of the month, You'll have quit. You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning. You don't need to jog far.
If I do a few exercises at home, Like crunches, I'll soon deal with this waistline.
Be careful when you go jogging. Don't put yourself under too much stress. You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition.
I'll join a fitness centre. I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice. There's one near my office, So I can go before and after work. I don't want to go jogging in the street, So I'll use a treadmill.
Good idea. Remember to eat healthily too. The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet.
Great. Thanks.

It's rather too high. If you can make it cheaper, We will be able to place large orders continuously.
If you order a large amount, We can give you a discount.
Well, Can you explain it to me?
The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1, 000 Units.
Can you reduce more?
I'm sorry, But to be frank, Considering exploiting the market in your country, We have already supplied you at very low preferential price.
In that case, We have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made. Please reconsider.
It is so hard to deal with.
If you can give us a more reduction, We'd be able to give you an order on the spot.
This price is the best we can make.
Yes, I want to buy some grapes.
What kind of grapes do you want?
People say grapes from XinJiang are much sweeter than other kinds. Please give me a kilo of that.
Ok, Wait a moment please.
Make sure they are fresh.
Trust me.
Well, I'm afraid we've had a slight delay.
What's the problem? We really can't have any delays at this stage. We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget.
The cement arrived late but don't worry, I'm confident we can still meet the deadline. The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again.

There are such shops living on selling parts. I don't like their service either. All they want is your money. But in the long run, They will be losing costumers. Anyway, Car service business is new in China. We all have to control what they are doing. Otherwise, They will not improve.

A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!
Cool!
Ok, Each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, You set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, It can move one space diagonally.
What about all these other pieces?
See this one that looks like a tower? It's called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, It's a very important piece so it's best to not let your opponent capture it.
And these two? They are husband and wife?
That's right! That's the queen and that's the king. If the other player captures your king, He will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over! Doesn't this sound fun?
Nah! This is boring! I'm gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!

I'm just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay.
You are shopping for a pillow online? That's absurd!
Why? I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for. This way, I just search for it online quick and easy.
I see, But how do you pay for it? How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

The dispensary closed. Here is the given prescription.

Now what?
I'll go back home with Danny. You go to the pharmacy again.
Okay, This is the third time.
What? How come? The third time?
You don't have to know. Bye for now.
Be careful.
I'm afraid I can't. Parking is not allowed here.
Oh, That's too bad. Where can you park around here?
There is a square in front of us, We can park the car there.
Is a shop there?
I'm not sure, You know I'm not familiar with the city, Too.
Just stop here for a moment. The police will not notice.
No, That's too risky.

Can I have some cookies first, Please?
Yeah, It's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century, And one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry.
What's interesting to see there?
Oh, There's plenty. Flowers and plants from all over the world, Of course. Besides, Gardening techniques are demonstrated, Modern facilities displayed, Academic exchanges and seminars organized, And folk performances of different nations shown almost every day.
I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year, And was impressed with so many beautiful flowers!
Oh, Can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares, And more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo.
It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park!
Far more than that, I dare to say! Inland provinces and cities, Hong Kong and Macao, As well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants. Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region, And folk performances are given. You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo.
Yes, I do it quite often.
Karaoke has become a major entertainment. I wonder why.
Simple, It's fun.

I wouldn't do that.
But I like the feeling.

Sure. Anything to drink with that?
A large coke, Please.
Eating here or to go?
Eating here, Please.
That's 7 dollars and 25 cents. You can get free refills with your coke.
Yeah. But Bob's talent can't to be named on the same day with Carl's.
But Bob is more generous and ready to help.
We cannot judge a man totally by that.
What a good idea!
What kind shall we get?
We could go to more places this time, If you liked.
Yes, Fine.
When shall we go and look?
Why not sometime next week?
No, Let's go on Saturday.
Ok.
Where shall we go?
There's a car dealer down the road. How about going there?
No, I don't like that place. Why don't we try the garage Martin recommended?
Fine, We'll do that.
My name is Wang Lin. My English name is Linda.
A nice name, Isn't it?
Yeah, Like it very much. My name has become a part of me.

Don't worry about your flu. You will be OK soon.
Thank you.
Tell me about fees.
What fees are you referring to?
I want to know about overdraft fees.
We charge a small fee every time you overdraft.
How much?
For each time you overdraft, You have to pay $ 25.
That's not a small fee.
You shouldn't overdraft.
That's for sure.
Do you need help with anything else?
That's all I needed to know. Thanks.
Where to, Sir?
I'd like to go to the railway station please.
Please hop in.
Is it a long run to the station?
It'll take about 20 minutes.
The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day, Are they?
Yes, They are.
Is it the rush hour now?
Yes, It is. Are you in a hurry sir?
No, I'm not. Would you please drive slowly and carefully?
Yes, Sir.
Not at all. What would you like to see first?
I really don't know.
Let's walk around the lake first, Shall we?
Yes, That would be lovely.
Have you been here before?
No, It's the first time I've been here.
I will take you to Li River after walking around here.
That's wonderful! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful!
Yes, You'll be in a different world there.
Send it by the fastest way.
Are you going to ship this by air? That might cost a little more.
How much?
I'll check the costs and call you back.
Ok.
Is that so?
Yes. I don't want to be stuck in a rut. I want to move on.
Have you decided?
Yes, I want to get a better job.
Could you tell me why you want to quit?
I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues.
Oh, That sounds terrible. Would you be happier with higher pay here? I'm sure something can be worked out.
I'm afraid not. I've promised my girlfriend. We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay.
Ok. I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you. However, I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay.
Good evening. We want a dinning room with a table for eight.
I'm sorry, Sir. The rooms are not available now. But would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall? I can find a table by the window for you.
No, Thanks. We have made a reservation before.
Can I have your name, Please?
My name is James.
I'll ask waitress to show you the way.
Thanks.
I would like to go to Europe for a visit? Can you recommend me an interesting city?
Why not go to Paris? It's famous for Arch of Triumph, Eiffel, Versailles and place de la Concorde.
Do you have a package tour to Paris?
Of course, We have.
What did you do?
I watered all the plants.
You have a lot of plants.
Then I did my laundry.
That takes some time.
I took the dog for a walk.
I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
I vacuumed the entire house.
That's a lot of work.
And then I made lunch.
I'll bet you were hungry!
What are you doing?
I'm playing with my new jump rope! Watch this!
You are sick, Young lady. Get back in bed! I called you in sick today, So you're going to lie down and fight that flu!
But I feel better.
Then maybe you should go to school. If you're feeling so much better, You'll ace that English test, Right?
Ok. I get it. I'm getting back into bed...
Much better, Thanks. I have been resting all day. Only with television as my companion. In fact, In the whole week the only thing I feel like doing was watching TV.
What did you watch today?
I started with game show this morning, I really enjoy them, And even answered the most of questions correctly.
And next?
At 2 o'clock, I switched to the Channel 6, And watched a terrific movie without commercials.
I know what you mean, There wasn't old action movie next. I think you won't like it.
I want to watch it, But I was already tired by the time it came on. I had a rest instead, Then I watched the news at Channel 11.
Anything important happened?
A bank was robbed this afternoon. A reporter on the scene covered the event, The live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live.
Hello. Is that Nicholas?

Yes, I do. Go on.

Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines.

All right, Mr. Jones. Do you think we'll need anything else?
I like listening to different kinds of music.

I enjoy Rock and R & B.
Why is that?
I like the different instruments that they use.
That's a good reason to like something.
Yeah, I think so too.
I sure did!
What candidate did you vote for?
I voted for Obama.
I'm shocked he actually won.
I knew he would win.

I think you have a point.
Yes, Sir. We have the all-inclusive luxury cruise. Maybe you would like to look at the itinerary.

I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field. My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, Where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, And as a result, My writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used.
What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession?
Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, And it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, Explained my situation, And got their input.
Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description?
There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week. Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks, My boss and I stayed until 2 a.M. For two nights before the final wrap up. It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results. My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort.
Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome.
I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, Which she and I discussed and eventually resolved. My boss was impressed with the work I had done.
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs. As far as weaknesses, I really enjoy my work, And sometimes I put in too much time. But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more.
Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss.
I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves. I asked her if I could talk with her one day, And we had a good discussion. It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure. I took the time to explain the procedures, And there haven't been any problems since that day.
When do you find a job satisfying?
My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job. When I first started as a paralegal, I had a lot to learn. But through hard work, Advice from some good mentors and continuing education, I have come a long way. I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner.
How would your coworkers describe you?
First, They'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. I really enjoy working with people. Secondly, They'll say I had great customer service skills. I put the customer first. And thirdly, They'll say that I know the law. I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously.
Do you have any questions?
Yes, I do. On a scale of one to 10, What would you say morale was in this company?
I am going to the Capital Hotel.
Get in. I will take you there.
About how much it will cost?
$ 50.
On the meter?
Ye, Of course.
Ok. Let's go.
That's right. I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores.
Well, Experience is not important in this job. We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller. By the way, Do you like to work with figures?
Yes, I liked math in school.
We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures. Do you like meeting the public?
Yes, I enjoy working with people.
We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with. You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you. He would be responsible for training you. Have you studied English conversation?
Yes, I had an American tutor for two years. I had two lessons under her every week. Would I be using English every day is this job?
Yes, Many of our customers are Americans, So you would be speaking English with most of them. Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts?
No, I'm afraid I don't. I'd be glad to learn.
That's good answer. I appreciate your being frank.
I would if I could.
Will you please explain the meaning of this word?
Yes, With pleasure.
I like word games.
How about a game of bridge?
I don't like it at all.
What about guessing games?
I'm not one for the games.
Let's play other game.
What about playing go?
Ok.
Sure. If you get on this road and turn left at the second intersection, You'll see it on your right-hand side.
Thank you so much for your assistance!
You are welcome.
Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight?
No, I'm going to leave the office early today. My annual medical check-up is this afternoon.
How much longer will Mr. Schmidt be up in the mountains?
He's on a weeklong meditation retreat and won't be back until this weekend.
Sorry, I'm supposed to be with my son.
Okay, I'll ask Bob to cover it.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
Well, I'Ve bought a lot of meat. I'Ve got pork chops, Small steaks, Chicken wings, And plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties.
I can't wait to start cooking! I'Ve bought the grill and charcoal. Do you have enough plates and utensils?
I think so. I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use. It will save on the washing up!
And if people drop them, They won't break. We'll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers.
They sell them at the shop around the corner. We can go and get some in a few minutes.
I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs. We'll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce.
I have the sauce, But remind me to get some ketchup at the shop.
How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue?
It only takes a few minutes. Some people like their meat well done. Others like it rare. The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked.
They can cook it themselves to make sure it's exactly how they like it.
I hope you haven't invited any vegetarians!
I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained, And offer me opportunity for advancement.
Why do you think you might like to work for our company?
I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested. What's more, Your company is outstanding in this field.
What makes you think you would be a success in this position?
My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job. I am sure I will be successful.
How do you know about this company?
Your company is very reputed in this city. I heard much praise to your company.
I'm not so satisfied with it.
Why do you plan to change your job?
I'm now a secretary in my present work unit. My work is not interesting. I have to type, Make copies, Book tickets and so on. Everyday I follow the routine. Furthermore, I have studied English for four years at university, But I can't use it there. They are the reasons I plan to change my job.
Why are you interested in working with this company?
One of my relatives told me that your company needs someone who can speak English. That's just the job that I have been looking for.
I'm from Germany.
So you speak German, Don't you?
Yeah, But I can speak English, Too.
Oh, I see. What other languages can you speak?
A little French.
Good.
Do you want to know the honest answer?
Why wouldn't I want to know?
You had pretty bad scores.
Exactly what do you mean by bad?
You failed.
How'd I fail it?
There are a couple of reasons why you didn't pass.
What did I do wrong?
To sum it all up, You really just don't know how to drive.
Thanks. Will I be able to take a retest?
Sure you can, In about two and a half weeks.
It's definitely your size.
Yes, It is very nice. I'll take it.
How do you prefer to pay?
Let me use my credit card.
Now, If you'll just sign here.
No problem.
I hope you enjoy your purchase. Good-bye.
I certainly did. Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend?
Sure.
How did the business trip go?
Well, To be honest, Nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss.
I understand. The last time I went on a business trip with the boss, I didn't even have enough to eat!
I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses. I spent half of the weekend on a train! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets!
Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes.
I see. Well, Then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip. It was reallytiring for me.
I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today.
Thank you. I can't imagine getting much done today. I'm just too exhausted!
No problem. Did you bring any gifts back for your department?
No, Should I have?
Go to Gate 56, The plane is now boarding, You must hurry.
Show me the fastest way to get there.
Instead of walking you can take this shuttle to get you there faster.
Do you think the plane will leave without me?
No, I will call the attendants at the gate. I'll tell them you are on your way.
Thank you so much, I would really appreciate that.
You're welcome, Have a safe trip.
How would you like them?
In ten dollar bill, Please.
Is there anything else?
Yes, I'd like to know how to send money to France.
This area here is where we keep our raw materials. The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it. Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area. Just to the right of Maintenance, There are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section. Process Control is also on the upper level. It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below.
It's near the Wall Street, A bit far from there. Why not get on the car.
Ok. Is there a Chinese restaurant?
Of course. More than that, You have Italy pizza, English steak, Kimchi and local specialties.
Woo, I can't help being there.
Yes, I'd like to buy a new computer, But I don't really know much about them. Can you give me any suggestions?
No problem. First of all, Do you want to get a home computer or a laptop?
Laptops are more expensive, Right?
Yes, They generally cost a little more.
I'll just get a regular home computer then. I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me.
I'm fine, Dr. Beecham. Yes, Just a cleaning and check-up today.
Oh, Fine. Let's take a look.
( She probed my teeth and checked my gums. ) Well, It looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted. Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them.
Okay, I'll do that, But my crown was just put on last year. Will my dental insurance cover the work?
Since you had that done here, We'll take care of it. There won't be a charge. And, Your insurance should cover the work on the cavity. Now, I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work.
Thanks, Doctor.
Because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law.
Yes, I suppose we must. I have enjoyed all these days that you have spent with me, And I'll always remember them. I've learned a lot from you. Thank you for all your kindness.
I'm glad you could come to see us off. I have enjoyed your interpreting. You have done a wonderful job. I hope you be my interpreter again next time I'm here.
I hope so, Too.
It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country, But nothing lasts for ever. I have to go back home this time, But I'm sure I'll return very soon.
I'm really glad to hear that.
Good-bye. Miss Li, Say hello to your husband and your son for me. See you soon.
Good-bye, Mr White. A happy journey home, And hope to see you again soon.
Well, Why don't you use a local SIM card?
Can I do that?
Yes. Just go to the convenience store and ask for a SIM card. Then insert it into your phone.
I see. How much will that cost?
Well it's 100 RIB for the SIM card then it will cost you about 10 RIB per minute to call the UK.
Wow, That is cheap. Thank you very much.
No. We broke up last month. I'm taking a break from dating for a while.
Did you break up amicably? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up.
We just decided to stop seeing each other. It was all very amicable. Are you still going out withmike?
Yes, I am. We're thinking about getting engaged. We'Ve been dating for over a year now.
Good for you! Have you seen Kelly recently? Is she still dating nick?
I havn't seen her for a while. She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her. He was seeing a girl form his office. One day, She saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately.
She was right to do that. I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon.
Really? They'Ve been together for a long time. When are they getting married?
I think it's 26th September. I'll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night.
Thanks. Hey, Look at that guy over there. I think he fancies you.
He certainly looks interested, Doesn't he? Shall we invite him over to our table?
How did I do?
Not so good. Lots of complains.
Really? I thought I was doing well.
Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives. I hope I'Ve made my point.
Not much. I started exercising.
Trying to get in shape?
Yeah, And I need to start improving my health.
Me too. What are you doing besides exercising?
That's about all.
I think if you eat better, It will help tremendously.
Sleep is good too. I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems.
Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy.
True. But I think it is worth it. When you get old, You want to be healthy and active.
Indeed. Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping.
Do you know how to get the bank account?
Bring your ID card and fill out a form. That will be fine.
So easy.
I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed.
My shopping life will be more convenient.
No.
Can you call an Ambulance?
Sure, What's happened?
Never mind.
I'm so sorry to disturb you so early.
It doesn't matter.
I'm dreadfully sorry. I forgot to book the tickets yesterday.
Oh, It's nothing.
I let you down. I'll make it up to you somehow.
Not a bit of it, Don't blame yourself.
Sure, What I can do for you?
I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients, But I just don't know exactly what to say, I don't even know how to get started, I know I should write dear Mr. Mrs. Or Ms., But the problem is I don't know the name of contact person.
You can just put Dear Sir or Madam, Officialese not personal, You can write to whom may concerned.
Ok, So I first thanks them for their business, I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support, How is that?
Good! But also, Write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing, Give them more reference.
Like Regarding our new product line, We would like to announce a special price discount.
Right, Do you need them to respond?
Yes, The letter would have a survey inside, And they should complete it and return to our office. How should I write that?
You can tell them "Please finding the enclosed customer service survey, Else also, You can say Attach a customer survey. If you need resource it right away, You can tell them the urgent by saying Please return the survey without dely as soon as possible. Maye it more polite with this as early as convenience.
I need to hire you.
What do you need me for?
I need you for my court date.
What kind of case do you have?
I'm being charged with a felony.
I can help you with that.
What is your price?
I charge $ 150 an hour.
I can't afford that.
That's my rate.
That's expensive, But I need you.
We have a few different wholesale vendors, So our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year. But the difference is miniscule, A fluctuation of about 0. 2 %.
That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit, Doesn't it? After all, Your sticker price is pretty much set in stone. How much do they go for retail?
Retail price is 29. 95 per unit. We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price.
Is that including tax?
No, That's the price before tax. The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas, So it is difficult for us to figure in.
How much is your profit margin then?
Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 %.
I'm not very sure. But I know ruby is less valuable than diamond.
How do you know that?
I got it from an encyclopedia.
I'm not quitting yet. You know my favourite slogan, Don't you?
Yeah, I know. Shop till you drop.
Right!
I'm getting a little short on cash. Let's just window shop a little.
Ok.
Hey, Jeanine, Get a load of that. It's beautiful.
Ahahah, And I thought you were tired.
You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses.
It sure looks special, Looks expensive too.
Sure does. Hey, Can I sponge a little cash of you?
Don't worry, Marian, I've got you covered.
Thanks, Jeanine, You are a real pal. Let's go in.
I'm just shopping.
What are you shopping for?
Some new clothes. How about you?
Same here.
Have you found anything nice yet?
I found a few pairs of pants.
Where'd you get those?
I found them at Pennies.
Those are really cute.
Do you want me to show you where I found them?
I would like that. Thank you.
We'Ve thought about it, But my husband and I can't afford it right now. The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums, Which is something I don't want to do.
Buying a house can be expensive, But there are ways to find cheaper houses.
Like what?
Well, Sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community. You'd have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day, But you would definitely save money doing it that way.
That's a good idea. Do you know anyone who has done that before?
Sure, My sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way. They're pretty satisfied with it.
Is the house pretty run-down.
Not at all. The woman, Who owned it,Took good care of it. But when she died, She had no family left and no will, So the government had to sell it for her.
Was it very old house?
It was about 75 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing, But it didn't take a lot of money or time.
Is it in a good location?
The area can be a bit rough in the evenings, But the neighbors watch out for each other, So it's ok.
I'd like to look at your stereo systems. Do you have anything on sale?
Yes, This system over here is on sale for $ 1, 000. As you can see, All of the components are brand-name.
But it doesn't have a turntable. I have a fair number of vinyl records, So I need something to play them on.
Our selection of stereo systems with turntables is somewhat limited, But we do have this system over here.
Did you get laid off?
I am still working for now, But I might get laid off.
You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off.
Does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment?
No, Some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment.
How can I find out if I can collect?
Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect.
How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment?
It depends on how much you earned. When you file, They will determine the amount.
Yeah, I'Ve been working so much overtime lately.
Really? How come?
My boss gave me a big project. I had to have it finished it by this morning. It was so difficult!
You shouldn't work so hard.
I know. But hard work pays off, You know.
What do you mean?
Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for.
Good afternoon, Miss Li.
How nice to see you again!
Nice to see you, Too.
It's been a long time, Hasn't it? How are you?
Fine, Thank you. And you?
Very well too, Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes. Could you guide me to where I can change money?
Sure, Mr. Anderson, Please come along with me.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
I like popular music best.
Me too.
Who is your favorite singer?
Qi In is.
Do you know this song?
Yes, I like it very much.
Let's sing it together, Shall we?
No problem.
It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon, Ms. Barkley.
That shouldn't be a problem. What is the exact address, Again?
7880 Crofton Avenue, Building 40A, Room 304.
Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, And a prompt will tell you the payment options.
Well, I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless service.
That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, If you want to hear them.
Yes, Please! Tell me about the alternatives.
We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor.
Very good. How much does that cost?
The service is free to hotel patrons. However, Printing costs ten cents per page.
I see. And the other alternatives?
Alternatively, We do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop down here.
Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?
You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
I feel kind of stupid.
Why?
We got lost coming back. I guess I don't really know this town yet.
You got lost. You're kidding!
No. We took a wrong turn somewhere. And Joseph doesn't know the town at all. So I started giving him directions. But I didn't really know where we were. So we got seriously lost.
You could have called.
I know I could have. But finally we asked someone where we were.
You've been gone for two hours. How could you get lost for so long?
Guess where we ended up.
I don't know. Where?
When we finally decided to ask someone, They told us we were in Grangerfield.
Grangerfield! You were in Grangerfield? That's a completely different town! How could you drive to a completely different town?
I don't know. The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here.
Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here.
I know it is. I don't know how it happened.
Hmm, Maybe I do.
What?
Maybe I have an idea how it happened.
How?
You were too busy looking at Joseph, And you weren't paying attention to the road.
Oh, That's what you think, Huh?
Yes, That's what I think. Maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries, You'll get lost for even longer. Maybe six hours or so.
You know what, Trish?
What?
I hope so. I really hope so.
Hah, Hah! See? I guessed right. You weren't watching the road at all.
No, I wasn't. It's kind of hard to watch the road when Joseph is behind the wheel.
Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students 'initiative and creativeness, Instead of taking their rights away from speaking.
What did you do to put it into practice?
I divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively. It can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students.
They wanted to go out, And so they made me look after my baby brother.
Didn't you mind doing it?
No, I didn't. My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework.
Didn't you even want to go to the cinema?
Not really. I watched television for an hour.
What was on television last night?
Boxing. It was excellent.
Oh. I enjoy watching boxing on television, Too. What a pity I missed it last night!
What did you do last night?
I went to a boxing match in the sports stadium.
Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.
I see. Well, You have come to the right place. We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers.
Sounds good. I don't want it to be too expensive, Maybe something mid-range.
We have this new ETC smart phone. It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications. It also has a built-in camera,Mp3 player and touch screen. It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.
What about Wi-fi?
Of course! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.
One last thing. Is it waterproof?
Yes. How much do you want?
Fifty dollars. What is the exchange rate today?
One dollar to five francs. Is that all right?
Yes, Please. And you can cash my traveler's check, Can't you?
Of course, We can.
I want to be here tomorrow. What are your business hours?
10 o'clock in the morning to 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
Thank you.
Not at all.
Well, We can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays. Our factories will be closed for another week.
That's all right. We will send you a purchase order in one week. I hope you will be able to take care of it.
No problem. Once we get your purchase order, We will begin the execution of the order right away.
Thanks. We need the products in less than one month, Because we have a big deal with another company. By the way, Will payment against delivery be OK?
That will be fine. And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order.
Who?
David Bush.
There's nobody here by that name.
Sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
I'd like to try some Chinese food.
We serve different styles of Chinese food here. But I'm not sure which one do you prefer.
I have no idea. Could you recommend some to me?
Well. Cantonese food is rather light, Beijing food is heavy, AndSichuan food is usually hot and spicy.
Oh, I see. I'd like to have hot food.
If so, I suggest you have a taste forSichuan food. MostSichuan dishes are spicy and hot, But they have different tastes.
Really? So do you have some specialties?
Yes. Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties.
All right. I'll have them.
So you knew it was me?
I had an idea.
Look, Before we get into the secret admirer thing, I want to talk to you about WebTracker.
I'm sorry. I know you feel betrayed.
So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker?
My mind is made up.
Some what?
Some Chinese food. I'm hungry, And there's a take-out restaurant near here. We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat.
No, I'd rather go out. The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home. Maybe we can try some other food today... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day, The one over in the shopping center?
Okay. I could go for that. It's called Al's Steakhouse. They also have great fried fish, And I love their salad bar. You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like.
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat?
Yes, Their steaks are enormous. Sometimes I can't finish what I'Ve ordered.
What if that happens to me? I hate to let food go to waste.
Don't worry. We'll just get a doggie bag.
Here's your bill.
Right. And would you please forward our mail to this address?
Certainly.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Hope to see you again.
Yes. I can't find my sweater. I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done. I find my swatter missing.
Well, It's our fault. We are sorry for that. Would you please fill out the form? We will pay for you.
That's fine. Maybe you should be more careful.
You should wear a formal dress and be confident.
What application materials should I take?
You should take several resumes and some copies of your graduate diploma.
I don't know exactly. I only hear it's financed by a famous film star.
Does it have a large circulation?
Yes, So it really doesn't matter who offers the money. The paper itself is profitable.
All right. How about other guests?
The rest of us will have this today's special, Please.
Ok.
I'm sorry but I ordered sole, Not the same as the others. Will you change it?
I'm afraid we have no more sole.
Then, I'll have this pork cute instead.
Certainly. Just a moment, Sir.
Let me try. It has to be somewhere amazing, And far away... Egypt?
How in the world did you guess that? Did someone tell you already?
Yes. I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store.
I want to ride a camel and definitely see the pyramids!
I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours.
It helps that my dad is an archaeologist.
We'll get to go fishing at the river. I hate fish.
No problem. What do you want me to get?
Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get.
Did you forget to put anything on the list?
I don't think I forgot anything.
Would you like me to go anywhere else for you?
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription.
Has your prescription been filled yet?
Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready.
Sure, I'll go get it for you.
Thank you.
Anything for you.
Ok, Sir. How many are coming?
4. By the way, What's your dress code?
We require a jacket and tie.
I see. Thank you.
Yes. An passport and a visa are necessary for entry into China.
What materials do they need in order to apply the passport?
They should fill in an application form, Hand in the copies of Identification Card and household register.
It's a difficult choice. The train is a litter faster, But much more expensive.
We could face delays if we travel by bus, Thanks to traffic jams.
Buses are more cramped and you can't walk around.
That's true, But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus.
Really? I think you see more traveling by train.
So, Which form of transport do you prefer to use?
I prefer going by train, Ever though it costs more.
Ok them. We'll go by train. I'm sure we'll have a good journey. Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets?
The train aren't usually full. We can get them on the day we travel. We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles.
We should take a packed lunch on the journey. The food they sell on the trains is always expensive.
Well I'm impressed with what the company has done in the past and I think by hiring me the company's future can only be brighter. I find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation.
So you'Ve acquainted yourself with the company. It's refreshing to interview someone who's sure of what they want.
Yes, I believe that it's crucial for me to know if a company is right for me, Not just if I'm right for the company. I'Ve only been impressed by what I'Ve read and heard and I see myself having.
Commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here.
Well I'm definitely a team player as well as being highly self-motivated. I believe this company can fulfill my long-term goals and offer me great upward mobility. Therefore you will find in me.
What is the problem?
I had a headache this morning. I didn't pay attention to it. I thought probably it is because I didn't sleep well. But now it is getting worse and worse. I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive. Maybe it is the migrated.
It is ok. You look really pale and red eyes. I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest.
Thank you very much. I am sure good rest will do indeed. I don't have this too often.
Yes.
She's another applicant, And a leading contender, But I didn't want to hire her. She's qualified, But she doesn't quite fit the profile. We're looking for an accountant, And part of the job requires interacting with clients. Well, Our clients want conservative people to handle their money. And green hair with ripped jeans doesn't exactly fill them with trust.
But it's the style now.
I realize that, But our business is serving clients and giving them what they want.
Of course.
Well, They don't want to deal with people who look like that. They want people who look more like yourself.
Why is that?
Well, They're older, And they don't understand today's fashions. When they see someone dressed like that, Warning bells go off. They don't like that style at all, And they don't like dealing with people who dress like that at work.
Oh, I see.
We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good, Very good. But, The clients reacted very negatively when they saw her. Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively.
What happened to her?
Well, She was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her, So her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her. She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends.
I see.
Yes, But you look fine.
Oh, It's for my brother. The little boy over there. He is getting a carsickness.
Poor boy! But don't worry. Here are two pills made in Germany. It's really effective. He will be just fine.
Thank you so much.
Take some with you next time, Just in case.
Sorry to interrupt, But my brother is still sleeping.
You mean the boy who felt carsick just now?
Yes. It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills.
Oh, Sorry, Maybe I gave you the wrong medicine.
What?
It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good. But don't worry. It has no undesirable side-effects.
I see.
Three. Two adults and one kid.
For buffet?
