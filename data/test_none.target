Not for soft drinks. But we charge ten yuan for each alcohol order.
What is your address, Sir?
I live in room 1106 of the Friendship Hotel.
Ok, Someone will be there by 12:15.
We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it.
I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat.
You have a good point. She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours.
I think she is really going to like her teacher though.
Yes, They seemed to click at the meeting the other day.
Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids?
No, But I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies!

Do you know what kind of salad that you want?
I'm not sure what kind that I want.
I usually make a Caesar salad.
Those taste really good.
Which kind of salad are you going to make?
I want a chicken salad.
I enjoy chicken salads.
I like salads with croutons, Almonds, And shredded cheese.
I really like how that sounds.
Why don't you make a salad like that?
I'm going to do that then.
I need some advice about my fixed deposits.
What seems to be the problem?
No, No problem. It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it.
I see. Well, You have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it. Which would you prefer?
Mmmm... Well, I am happy with your service so far, So I'd like to renew it, Please.
Not a problem. But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity?
Yes...
You see, That means when anything is up for renewal, We do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out. All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you.
That's just perfect for me. I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in.
No way. Do it yourself.
Please, I promise this is the last time.
Ok, I'll iron your shirt for you, But only if you make me a cup of coffee.
Well, I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now. I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design.
What systems have you worked on?
I have worked on about every system that is out right now.
Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm?
I am not as familiar with it as I am with some of the older systems. But I am a fast learner and I can master it in a short time.
What do you consider your strengths?
I am knowledgeable and levelheaded.
Yes, Mr. Miller. We'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting.
That's right. The meeting is very important. Where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins?
In the dining room. It's spacious there.
We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting.
I've arranged for an interpreter to be present. But it is said these foreigners could speak English.
Really? I'll also try to speak slowly. How would you arrange the guests 'seats, Jane?
We've prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for guests to sit by. What time would you like refreshments served, Mr. Miller?
Well, After my report, There will be an interval for rest and refreshments.
All right, I see.
Yes. Go down the main road. You can't miss it.
How long will it take me to get there?
It's only about a five-minute walk.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Do you have an appointment?
No, I don't. You look pretty busy today. Do you have an opening for me?
Yes, We do. I can cut your hair right now if you like. Do you need a shampoo too, Or just a haircut?
Just a haircut. I washed my hair this morning.
Alright. I will have an assistant wet your hair. Then I can cut it. Please step over there. How would you like your hair cut today?
Well, I last had a haircut eight weeks ago. So my hair is pretty long. But I want the same style.
I recommend you leave it a little long on top. But we should take in the back and sides a bit more. That's more fashionable now.
Alright. You are the expert. I'm happy to have your recommendation.
So I will cut the sides just above the ear. Is that good?
Fine.
And do you usually part your hair along here?
Yes.
Alright, I know just what to do. Your hair seems quite dry, You know. And I see some split ends.
Yes, I know my hair is quite thin. It runs in my family. Everybody has very thin hair.
The problem is the split ends. They make your hair look even more frizzy.
I don't know what to do about it.
Well, There are two things you can do. First, Don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower. Let it dry naturally. That is easier on the hair, So you won't get split ends. Second, Buy a g.
Do you sell conditioner here?
Of course. I have one I can suggest.
Great. I would be happy to try it. I know my hair doesn't look good now. It's too weak.
The problem is the split ends.
Yes, We have many kinds of pies and puddings.
Can you give us more information?
Sure. We have lemon pies, Apple pies, Coffee rum pies and ice cream.
I would like to have the coffee rum pies.
Most normal little girls go wild over Barbie dolls.
That sounds good. Let me see one.
Here's the latest model — Digital Barbie.
Oh, She's nice. How much is she?
Why, She's only $ 29. 95.

Good afternoon, Mrs Smith.
Good afternoon. Have a seat, Please. You are Mr. Sun?
Thank you. Yes, I am Dunlin.
I have read your resume. I know you have worked for 3 years. Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering?
Many factors led me to major in mechanical engineering. The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines.
What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering?
I like designing products, And one of my designs received an award. Moreover, I am familiar with CAD. But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed.
Why did you decide to apply for this position?
Your company has a very good reputation, And I am very interested in the field your company is in.
What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours?
Interpersonal and technical skills.
We have several applicants for this position. Why do you think you are the person we should choose?
I have the abilities, Qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert, For example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president.
That sounds very good. How do you see your career development?
After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management. I want to become a supervisor in your R &D department.
Have you anything to ask about the job?
Yes. Do you offer any opportunities for further study?
Yes. If you undertake additional courses, Provided these are approved, And you complete them successfully, You can claim back part, Quite a large part, 75 % of the costs you incurred. Not just the fees, - traveling and other expenses too.
That's fine.
Anything else?
No.
Well, Thank you very much, Mr. Sun. I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible. Goodbye.
Thank you, Mrs. Smith. I do hope the answer will be favorable. Goodbye.
Well, Under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so. It depends on the user, But about once a month is average.
So if I don't print out very much, It could last a lot longer?
That's right. It could last six months or more. This model's designed for heavy use. Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head.
You're right, We need to start making money soon, Or at least manage to break even. But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now.
Deman is dropping. The problem is our competition. They are monopolizing the market!
Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller.
It's really too early to tell, But a lot is riding on the new products. If we don't do better after the product launch, We may have to go bankrupt.
Do you think it's that serious?
Look at this numbers and see for yourself. Read'sm and weep.
My goodness, I didn't realize it was that bad.
Why?
I'm going to take you to your school to register for classes.
That's right. I haven't done that yet.
You can choose classes that you like at the school office.
Really?
Well, There are core courses and electives.
What do they mean?
Core courses are ones that you must take. Elective courses are ones that you get to choose for yourself.
Yes, I'm looking for a new winter coat.
Have you any particular color in mind?
I don't know really. What's the fashional color this year?
Red is very popular.
Good. Red suits me very well. It's a cheerful color, Isn't it?
Yes, Madam, I agree. What size are you?
Well, I used to be size fourteen, But I've put on a bit of weight recently, So may be sixteen.
Here you are, Madam. All these are sixteens.
I quite like this one. How much is it?
It's $ 180.
Oh, That's too expensive. Aren't there any cheaper ones?
These are our cheapest coats, Madam.
Yes, I see. I'll take it. Here's $ 200.
Here's your change.
Thank you.
I am sorry, But we can't advance shipment. The manufacturers are fully committed. They have no stock on hand.
Can you find some way for an earlier delivery?
How's this then? We propose partial shipment. We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready.
Sounds like a good idea.
We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug.
I agree with your proposal.
I want to sign up for some funds units. How do I go about it?
Have you got some ID and your cash card?
Yes. I've already got a fund account with you too.
How many more fund units would you like to purchase today?
I'm not quite sure. You see, I already have more than 5, 000 RIB in my cash card, But I really don't know how much I should get.
The usual minimum purchase is 5, 000 RIB.
That settles it then. 5, 000 RIB it is, Thanks.
May I ask if there's anything wrong with it?
You see, There is a run at the neck.
Oh, Sorry. But do you want to change it for another one?
No, Thank you.
I know Mark is your only child. You may do it differently from what I did. Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles.
I do it, Too. You know, Sometimes when we eat, My child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat. And if it were something he doesn't like, He would spit it out and throw it into other dishes. He does it very often. I really get mad. I can't help spank him sometimes.
And what does your husband do?
My husband is an American. He criticizes me when I do that. He says that I can't change a child's behavior by using force. He is learning what I am doing now.
But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either! You'Ve got to have patience with him and teach him. It's not easy, I know. It's hard.
Yeah. I'm still learning how to control his behavior and my temper. My child is almost two years old, And I'Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something.
I have a Promissory Note, But it's not called that. It's a Bill of Exchange.
Similar to a Promissory Note, Yes. I can deal with that for you right here. The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation.
So, Even if someone wasn't directly involved, They can become involved? Like the bank you cash it in?
That's right. We didn't issue it to you, But technically we are buying it from you. So, We become involved.
I see. Sorry about this, I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out.
As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about.
Your doctor wants to test your urine and needs a sample.
How am I supposed to do that?
We need you to urinate like you normally would, And then stop and finish into the cup.
What am I supposed to do with the cup when I am done?
Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom. Just close the cubby door and walk away.
What kind of test is this?
He wants to know if you have bacteria in your urine, Which could signal an infection.
How long will it take to get the results?
We will send your doctor the results, And he will contact you.
All right. Where do you live, Sir?
At 345 Lincoln Avenue. Oklahoma City.
Very well. Why do you want to disconnect your phone, Sir?
I'm moving to a new home.
O. K. May I have your name please?
John Smith.
Thank you. Mr. Smith. What's your telephone number?
555-7658.
Thank you. Where should I send your final phone bill?
623 West Side Drive. New York, New York.
Thank you, Mr. Smith. Your phone will be disconnected after this phone call. Have a nice day.
Thank you, You too.
Rudeness. You are not expected to sit down before being invited, And you shouldn't throw yourself into the chair like you're loading heavy baggage.
And we should have good sitting posture.
That's right. The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side. This is especially important in summer.
Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office?
Put it beside you. Don't pile your purses, Briefcase and other belongings on the employer's desk. You've got long hair. Don't touch it while talking to the interviewer. It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work.
I think that's the reason why Princess Diana's hair style became so popular.
Also, If you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk, Neither lean on it nor look at the documents there.
I ought to respect other people's privacy, As most Westerners do.
As the saying goes, When in Rome, Do as the Romans do.
Hello. I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account.
I see. Well, This bank offers many different accounts of this nature. There are 7 to choose from.
Oh dear. I wanted AUD. Is that not possible?
Well, You could change your Australian dollars into, Say British pounds and then open an account. How does that sound?
Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account.
Excuse me, Miss. Can you show me my seat?
Let me have a look at your boarding pass. It's E - 6, The sixth seat by the aisle.
Thanks a lot.
Could you please fill out this form?
Okay, Here you are. ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk. )..
Here's your $ 200.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Of course, Mr. Green.
Can you print it out before 12 o'clock? I need it this afternoon.
No problem. I will do it immediately.
Please double space it and print it out on the laser printer so I can read it easily.
Ok. Would you like this report done in a formal or informal style?
Please type it in a formal style.
I see. Anything else?
No, Thanks.
I lost one of my contact lenses, And I'm searching high and low for it.
Where did you lose it? Maybe I can help you to find it.
Thank you very much. I think I lost it near the window.
Now, How would you like this check cashed, Madam?
Six tens will be fine.
Here you are.
Thanks. Er,Mister, If I want to deposit checks next time. What should I do?
Just make out a deposit slip and come here during bank hours. That's from 9 a.M. To 3 p.M.
You definitely made the right move by calling. Our primary business is creating, Conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours.
It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team. Not to mention serious lapses in service, Sales and leadership skills.
Well as we know nothing comes out of a can. We have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company. We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe.
What a relief! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again.
That's what we're here for, The human resources help you need, When and how you need it.
Don't touch that thermostat! You don't pay the bills around here!
Dad! Are you serious? What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it! Look, I can see my breath!
Put on a sweater! I'm not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.
Dad! I'm gonna catch a cold!
When I was your age, My parents didn't have central heating like you do! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it. We used it to cook, Heat the house and even dry our clothes! We never caught a cold. You should be grateful!
Yes, We'd have your regular dinner. What courses are there, Please?
The courses for our regular dinner are, Appetizer, Soup, Beef steak,Dessert and coffee.
All right, We'll have it.
What kind of dessert do you want?
Do you have some chocolate cakes?
Yes, We have.
Ok, We will choose it.
Wait for a moment, I'll come back soon.
Yep. The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns.
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.
Yeah, Good idea. We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill. I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.
Great! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.
This is gonna be a great barbecue!
I'm not sure if that would be wise.
Then what is your opinion?
Well, Maybe we'll go to ask Mr. Johnson. He has the final say.
Oh, We need an umbrella. The weather is so changeable in that area.
Yes, Let's go. Lock the door, Please.
All right.
Nothing really.
I'm throwing a party on Friday.
I didn't realize that.
You didn't?
Nobody has told me anything about your party.
Did you want to go?
When does it start?
At 8.
I'll be there.
I'd better see you there.
Of course.
Hello. I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software. I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C.
No problem, I can do that for you right now. Have you checked the documents?
I have, But I have never done this before so would it be possible for you to double check them?
Of course, That's all part of the service.
Thank you. I don't think there should be any problems, But just to be sure...
Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine. If I do have any queries I'll call you, Ok?
That's fine. Thank you again.
Okay, Well it's always more difficult to describe them isn't it?
Definitely, But if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be?
Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career. I suppose I'm quite a restless character. My father always taught me to be a high achiever.
So would you say if things don't go your way at work it could easily get you down?
Well, In a way yes. But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities. I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.
Well, You know journalism is a highly competitive world, So you do need to keep pushing yourself it's true. Okay, Well let's move on to talk about the job position here, Shall we?
Yes, Please.
Are you homesick?
I miss my parents.
Don't worry about the bill. Just call.
Can you show me how to make an overseas call?
Of course. First dial the code 011 to get an international line. Then you dial Taiwan's country code.
That's 886.
Now you should know the rest. Don't forget to dial Taipei's city code.
Yes, We have a nice room on the sixth floor.
How much is it?
200 yuan a night.
Ok.Dose it include breakfast?
Yes. And could I have your name?
Kate Green.
How long do you want to stay?
5 days. And could you send a bellboy to pick up my luggage?
Sure. We'll be there in a few minutes.
Could you keep my valuables?
We'd like to. You may call the attendant if you need any help.
What's up?
Could you pick up Mrs. David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport?
Why don't you go?
I'm supposed to do it, But the general manager called me last night. He said he couldn't come back to Beijing as scheduled, So he asked me to attend the meeting for him.
I see. I'll do it for you.
Thanks a lot. It's very kind of you.
I think Applied Sociology is a practical subject that can be widely applied to research on soci-ety and man. Hence, I chose it as my major.
Have you taken the course in Public Relations when you are in college?
I am sorry to say I haven't, But I have taken many other courses that concerns the PR, Such as Social Psychology, Public Affairs and Mass Communication.
Yes. I'm coming to confirm my ticket.
May I have your name, Please?
My name is Zu Ping. In fact, I have a reservation on Flight No. 125 for Zhenjiang, Leaving Beijing at 2:00 p.M. Tomorrow. Now I'd like to make a change of my travel schedule. Is it possible to change my booking to the day after tomorrow?
Certainly.
Do you have a seat available on the same flight the day after tomorrow?
Yes. You are reconfirmed on Flight No. 125 for Zhenjiang, Leaving Beijing at 2:00 p.M. On January 15th.
Thanks a lot.
You are welcome.
There is one around the corner.
Can I make an international call from that pay phone?
Yes, But you have to get a phone card first.
Where can I get a phone card?
You can get one in the grocery store over there.
Oh, I see it. Thank you.
Could you spell that please?
Of course. C, Y, G, N, E,T.
Cygnet. Ok, I've got that.
Chill! I'm just curling my eyelashes.
It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture.
You're such a wimp! You're afraid of an eyelash curler.
Well, You might pinch your eyelid! Or lose an eyeball!
It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards.
What for?
Yes, John. I'm on my break. What's going on?
Not much. I just wanted to see how you were. How's married life treating you?
Great, Except for my mother-in-law! Sometimes I think I married her instead of my husband! How about you?
Yeah! I bought it the day it was released.
How do you like it?
It's a great game. There are a lot of new characters.
Did it cost very much.
It cost about thirty. Most games cost about that much.
Mechwarrior is such a good game. The graphics are awesome!
Oh, I know what you mean. I'm addicted to that game.
My roommate always wants to play it. But I told her to buy her own game.
Yeah, My roommate likes to watch me play. He says it's like watching a movie.
I've never seen such good graphics.
And I've never heard such good sound in a game.
Is there anything you don't do in-house?
Yes. If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here, We send it out for maintenance.
Is that more expensive?
It depends on the job. It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often.
I'd like to look it over before I sign it.
Ok, No problem. I hope there are no questions about the terms.
I am fully satisfied with the terms of this contract.
Shall we sign this contract now?
Ok. Where do you want me to sign?
Just sign at the bottom.
Ok. ( Sign ) Once a contract is signed, It has legal effect.
You're right. Thank you for your cooperation.
It's my pleasure.
I still have no idea what to do now.
Don't act like this. Please have good thoughts in your mind. What's behind you?
I could not agree with you more. But I feel worried about what to do next as soon as I begin to write my resume.
There is no need to do like this. We can surf the net and find some templates for resume.
Sounds good. I will do it in a jiffy. Ok! Let's put our heads together.
You said it. We can also find some helpful advice from some experts.
Terrific!
Yes, I want one with automatic transmission.
I think that one fits you. Do you need insurance?
Full insurance, Please.
Ok, By the way, Fill the gas tank when you return the car.
But I don't think so. No one has ever said a word that you are to die, Only yourself. That means you are not willing to die, Right? Actually, You are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment. Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful. You must be confident. Your condition is much better physically, But a little bi difficult mentally. The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us.
Is what you said really true?
Of course. I am a nurse and a nurse tells the truth.
Thank you.
They're so much fun to eat. You can suck all the coating off first...
Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once!
But that way you're not savoring it.
Whatever. Give me another pack.
Hey! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone!
That's right.
May I have a look at it please?
Yes, Of course. Come in.
How long have you lived here?
I have lived here for twenty years.
Twenty years! That's a long time.
Yes, I have been here since 1976.
Then why do you want to sell it?
Because I have just retired. I want to buy a small house in the country.
How much does this house cost?
6850 pound.
That's a lot of money!
It's worth every penny of it.
Well, I like the house, But I can't decide yet. My wife must see it first.
Women always have the last word.
Yes. I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years, And before that, I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer.
Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case?
Yes, On the shipper's side, When the cargos arrives, All relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee. Among other things, This party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list. When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed, This party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent. Based on the survey report, They will lodge a clam for compensation.
If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest?
I think, First of all, I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading, If they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper. Meanwhile, Bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility.
Are you able to operate the telex?
Yes, I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information.
Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English?
When I was college, I passed Band Six of College English Test. All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good.
If you are selected for the position, You must prepare to travel overseas frequently.
No problem, I love it. Thank you for granting me the interview.
Yes, I think so too.
I think that it's going to rain.
I hope that it does rain.
You like the rain?
The sky looks so clean after it rains. I love it.
I understand. Rain does make it smell cleaner.
I love most how it is at night after it rains.
How come?
You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains.
I would love for it to rain today.
I would too.
Good morning. I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here. I'd like to discount it. Is that possible here?
Yes, We can do that. We require the original Trading Contract and also the VAT Invoice and the Commodity Delivery Documents. They all need to be in duplicate.
Yes, I've got all that here.
Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this? The Legal Rep, I mean? We also need the Loan Certificate as well. Do you have that?
A copy or the original? I guess you need the original, Right? Ok, I'll return shortly.
I have a sore throat and headache.
Do you feel tired?
Yes, My whole body feels weak. And I really feel terrible.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'll have to examine you.
Ok, Go ahead.
Open your mouth and show me your tongue. Say ah... You have a bad cold. So you must stay in bed for a week.
Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed.
What? You've got to be kidding me!
I wish I were, But i am deadly serious. She said you invited her to dinner last week.
Of course I did. As recognition for a job well done. Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner.
Well, There is no problem there. But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused, And that your motives are personal and not professional.
I think she's misinterpreted my intentions. What happens now?
Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown. It's quite serious. You could be reprimanded, Or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring.
I understand that. But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction.
That's the purpose of the meeting. Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out, And a little discussion and apology can calm the waters.
Certainly, Sir. How much rent did you want to pay?
Well, I didn't want to pay more than $ 520 a month.
$ 520 a month? We don't often have apartments as inexpensive as that. We have one apartment for $ 599 a month, On Seventh Avenue. It's near the station.
Is it furnished?
No. It's unfurnished. It has a kitchen, But no oven. There's a garden in the back, But the tenants can't use it. The landlord lives downstairs. Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight. No noise and no television after 11.
No, Thank you! I want an apartment, Not a prison.
If only we'd remember to close it.
I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone, Darling!
I wish I'd put it in the bank.
Look! They've taken your fur coat too.
I know, I am sorry I ever bought it.
I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television.
It's a pity they didn't take the tele. We need a new one. Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company.
I wish we could, But we can't, You see, We are not insured.
Sure, What do you need to do there?
There's problem with my bank statement. There's a mistake on it. I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM.
I have to exchange some money.
That's right. You're going away next week.
I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account. There was a problem last week.
I have to pay my credit bill too. If I don't pay it soon, The credit card company will charge me interest.
Their interest rates are usually quite high. It's a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest.
Where to, Sir?
I'd like to go to the railway station please.
Please hop in.
Is it a long run to the station?
It'll take about 20 minutes.
The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day, Are they?
Yes, They are.
Is it the rush hour now?
Yes, It is. Are you in a hurry sir?
No, I'm not. Would you please drive slowly and carefully?
Yes, Sir.
I think I'd rather have tea this morning.
What else are you going to have?
Just an English muffin. What are you going to have?
That sounds good. I'm going to order the same thing.
Certainly. Here you are.
What do you think of it?
Very smart!
Yes.
Hello, Mr David Richton, This is Min Wang calling from network, I am calling about the reporter position you advertised on the internet.
Oh, Yes, Mr Wang, I look at your resume you emailed, Very impressive, Are you a P.M. ~ meet someone like you, I was thinking of calling you this afternoon, And having a telephone interview.
That is wonderful.
I know. I intent to go to the store today.
Would you get some that new cereal we saw advertise on TV.
Which one?
You know. The one with the silly art about how advisements have jump up and down.
Oh, You mean kikois.
Yeah, That's the one.
Well. I'll see, Sometimes the store don't have some one of new kinds of cereal.
Not really.
This is the kitchen. Every - thing's new.
It's great!
I wouldn't call myself outgoing. I used to be very shy when I was little, And it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year, And have more fun in groups.
Are you more of a follower or a leader?
I don't try to get in front of people and lead them, Particularly. I'd rather cooperate with everybody else, And get the job done by working together.
What basic principles do you apply to your life?
Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today. I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them, And they're gone! Putting things off just makes it worse later, So even if it's hard at the time, I try to get things done that day and not let them go.
I am ready to make my plea.
What do you plead?
I plead not guilty.
All the evidence indicates that you are guilty.
I realize that, But I am not guilty.
Is that right?
I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed.
Who is the guilty party?
I'll tell you if you let me go.
I'd be glad to make a deal with you.
I am willing to tell you that information.
What seems to be the problem?
My computer just crashed again for the third time today!
What were you doing when it crashed?
I was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery.
I think that might have been a virus.
Oh, No! I thought it seemed a bit strange.
What kind of computer do you have, A Mac or a PC?
It's a PC. Doesn't everyone have a PC in this office?
No, Some people have Macs now, Too.
What's the difference?
Pcs often crash from virus, But it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a Mac.
I didn't know that.
Has your computer turned back on yet?
Yes.
Did you end up losing any of your work?
Fortunately, I saved my work right before it crashed, So it should be OK.
You should probably call the IT department and have them check your computer for virus.
That's a good idea. I'll call them now. Thanks for your help!
What is it?
It's for a job. It looks perfect for you.
Let's see... 'Wanted, Manager for up-and-coming firm. Must have good organizational skills. Experience a plus. Please contact Betty Sue.'Oh, I don't know...
Come on, What have you got to lose?
What about my resume?
Here, I'll help you type one up.
Thanks, Mary. You're a real pal. I'll call now to set up an interview.
We have over sixty employees. We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff. We started off with only ten people, So our workforce has grown a lot.
What's your annual turnover?
It was just over two million euros last year.
I need a packet of cigarettes please.
Of course sir, No problem.
Thanks.
Yes. And they don't give you very much either. I'm still hungry.
I'm sure this one is especially bad. And the word is so unpleasant.
Don't do this! Don't do that! You mustn't do this! You can't do that!
Well, I'm going to write a letter of complaint.
And we'll all help you.
I think it's beautiful. I want to hang it in the living room.
It looks like some kind of mistake.
That's the beauty of it — the imperfection.
Oh. Who is the artist?
Your daughter. She sold it at the school auction.
Oh! How about we hang it over here where everyone can see it?
I guess you see the value in it, Too.
Yes, Tomorrow is my friend's birthday. Could I arrange a birthday party for him through you?
Certainly.
I want to order a large birthday cake, Several kinds of cold dishes, Pastries and fruits.
Any drinks?
I've got whiskey and brandy but I need some beer and soda. That's all.
Thanks a lot for calling us. Could you tell me more about what you need us to do?
Oh, You see, We are on the 8th floor, And moving into the 6th floor in another building. It is about 15 kilometers to get there.
Ok, The cost depends on the floor to move to, The distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move.
How much will it cost in that case?
Oh, Let me see. It fits the second standard rates. Have a look at the contract, Please.
Your charge is divided into two parts, The Payment in Advance and the rest. I thought that I should pay all of it before moving.
No, Firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs, And the rest when we finish moving.
The damage and compensation item confuses me. Could you give some explanation?
Ok. If any of the articles was damaged during moving, You may make a claim for compensation with our department.
Basically I get 5, 000 RIB every month. It is a well-paid job with satisfying working hours.
What are your salary expectations?
I require 6, 500 RIB per month as a start. This is my bottom line, The minimum salary I can accept.
What's the trouble, Ma'am?
I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away.
What did the young man look like?
Well, He's young, Tall and thin.
To which direction did he run?
Let me see... My right arm... Oh, To the east.
Good morning! Welcome to our office!
Nice to meet you! My name is Peter Smith.
Nice to meet you too! I am George Williams.
This is my first day at work!
Well, Hope you will enjoy your first day!
I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance!
I will try my best to assist you if you need any help.
Thank you. It is very kind of you.
You are welcome.
Yes. My car is having problems.
What's wrong?
It won't start.
Do you want me to take a look?
No, Thank you. I think I can handle it.
Well, If you change your mind, Let me know.
I will. Thanks. That's sweet of you.
No problem.
I might need some tools though. Do you know where I can get some?
Sure. I have all kinds of tools. Just ask. I'll be happy to get them for you.
Thanks. That would be very helpful.
Anything for you. Seriously, I don't mind helping.
Ok. If you really insist, I could always use the company.
You look a little lost, Can I help you?
Um, I'm just having a look around. It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow. I'm trying to find her something.
Well, You can't give her granny panties. Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear? We'Ve got these lovely, Silky nighties. Or, How about a nice panty-and and-bra set. Look, Here's a nice satin push-up bra, And you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it.
Sure that's fine.
This is so awkward... What ones do I pick? What size is she?
Well, Do you want a thong, Some bikini briefs, Maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts?
Just pick something and get the hell out of here. Um, I'll go with these two. This is mortifying. I just want to get this over with. She better thank me for this...
Here you are, Sir. I'm sure she'll enjoy them.
Finally!
I'm sorry, Sir. I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag.
They arrested me for nothing.
What do you mean?
They weren't supposed to arrest me.
Didn't they let you go?
They didn't let me go until the next morning.
So they kept you at the station?
They sure did.
Did they tell you why they arrested you?
I matched the description of a robbery suspect.
I understand.
I want to take them to court.
I want to have a two-day trip around the city.
Would you please have a look at the table? I think this one fits you.
It's interesting. I think I will take the bus tour. By the way, What about the lodging?
We will lodge at the indigenes 'houses. It's interesting.
There are such shops living on selling parts. I don't like their service either. All they want is your money. But in the long run, They will be losing costumers. Anyway, Car service business is new in China. We all have to control what they are doing. Otherwise, They will not improve.
Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it's someone gets rip-off.
Yes, There is. Those organizations exist. You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help.
Ok, Here you are.
Well, Could I have coffee instead of orange juice?
Of course, You can. Wait a moment.
I'm here to ask about a loan.
We have many loans on offer. May I ask what the purpose of the loan is?
I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child. I'd like to buy a car for the family.
I see. What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans.
Could you tell me what the requirements are for that, Please?
Certainly. It's quite simple really. Do you hold a resident's permit?
Yes, I do. I was born and bred here.
That's great. We'll also need details of your occupation.
I have all of that with me. I've also banked here for a number of years.
First, You fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook.
Is there any minimum for the first deposit?
No, Even a dollar is all right. Here's your passbook, Sir, Just sign your name on it.
What is the annual interest rate?
It varies from time to time. At present it is 6 %.
By the way, Can I open a checking account too?
By all means. But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks.
Good for you. What items did you bid on?
A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams 'used tennis rackets!
Your idol! Wow! You're even better at finding stuff than me!
Yep. I placed a bid for the shirt. The minimum was ten so I bet fifty!
That's not how this game works.
Well, There was a sign that said “ Buy now for seventy. �.
How many bids had been placed before you?
You have hit the point. It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds.
But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one. Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes, Perhaps, A majority of them from the educated group. It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it.
To my mind, The success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue.
Not too bad, I suppose.
What did the woman ask you?
Oh, She asked me all sorts of questions. She asked if I smoked, And whether I played sports, She asked me where I went to school, And what subjects I took, And she asked me if I like to meeting people.
Did she ask you any questions about your family?
Well, She asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward.
Did she tell you whether you would get the job?
No, But she told me to telephone her next week.
I'm looking. Can you still remember what the conductor said?
She said that when we get off the bus, The Book Building is right by the bus stop.
But I don't see it.
Oh, Dad, Look at the sign, Please!
Oh, My god! We get off at the wrong stop. I'm so sorry, Honey.
Ok, Dad, It happens.
It's my fault. So what can we do now? Walk?
Come on, I'm too tired!
Ok, You promise don't tell your mother about it, We'll take a taxi.
Sure, I promise.
If you keep your promise, I will also let you watch Ultraman this evening.
I want to buy a cell phone for my daughter.
How old is she?
She is 17. It's for her birthday.
We have a new-fashioned cell phone especially designed for young girls. The brand name is Nokia.
Thanks, But I want to have a look at the Motorola's products.
Sure. This is the one I will not hesitate to recommend. Its color and style is so attractive and also the quality is really reliable.
Sounds perfect. I'll take the pink one. Can you pack it for me?
Sure. By the way, Here are some free adornments. Would you like one?
Why not? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well. I'd take this one.
Have a seat over there. I'll pack it up for you right away.
Thanks.
I guess not.
I hope you're not turning into asissy on me, Dave.
Look, I want to succeed just as much as you do. Well, Maybe not quite that much.
If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things, Invoking is going to fail.
What are you trying to say?
I'm saying this ship needs a new captain. Are you with me, Or aren't you?
Um, Sure. What are we having for dinner? Do I need to put out anything in particular?
Well, Make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers. I don't know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case.
Ok, Should I use the fancy silverware?
Yeah go ahead, Forks, Spoons and knives. I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.
I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner.
Honey? Have you seen our soup bowls?
They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes. Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there.
Oops!
I'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room.
Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art. How about these ones?
These are beautiful! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling?
Yes, Sir.
How fine the needlework is! What's the price?
Ninety dollars.
It's too expensive.
But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more.
You're right. Would you please show me some embroidery? I also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry.
Please wait a minute, Sir.
Yes. I want to make a remittance to New Delhi.
Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft?
I'd like a banker's draft please. It's not really urgent.
Just go to the end of the store. And it will be on your right. We have all the ice creams and frozen foods back there in the freezers.
This is my first time here.
Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling. That might help you.
I'm glad I asked you. So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables.
That's correct.
Yes, I reserved a table for six people.
Your name, Please?
Michaeldonsie.
I see. We had a table reserved for you. This way, Please.
Excellent. Come in please. The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs. It keeps breaking down.
When did it first break down?
About ten days ago. I'Ve tried to use it since then. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It's very frustrating.
Is it still under warranty. If it is and I can't fix it, It would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one.
Yes, It's still under warranty. Over the last few weeks, It's also been making a high-pitch noise when it's in use.
Ok. I'll start by looking at the motor. I'll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine... Oh, Yes. There's the problem. It's quite simple. I'll sort it out in a few minutes.
What's wrong with it?
Part of the motor is loose. I can put it back in place quite easily.
That's great. Thanks very much. Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?
Why? It's unfair. How about goingdutch?
You paid the last time, Because I didn't have any money, Remember?
Oh, Come on, I almost forgot. Don't worry about it. I didn't mind picking up the tab last time.
But you really should let me treat one time, I feel like I own you one if I didn't.
Ok, But it's only for this time.
What's the damage?
It's 12 dollars 80 cents all together. But don't forget the tip, It usually 15 %.
Check, Please.
Yes, It's the correct thing to do.
But we may not get another partner.
Even so, We can't do business with him. He's not reliable.
Hello, Lucy, This is Monica. I'm calling for the accountant position. I saw the information about the vacancy on your company's website. Is it still available?
Thank you for your interest. The position is still available. Have you already sent your CV to us?
No, Not yet. First, I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information.
It is quite urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon. If all these is not problem for you, I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly.
The notification period of my current job is not that long and I'm quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I'm good dealing with the people from other cultures. It makes the whole job even more interesting. I will send my resume to you still this week.
I would if I could.
Why can't you?
Because I have other obligations.
We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents.
I see. Could you make an exception and acceptD / A orD / P?
I'm afraid not. We insist on a letter of credit.
To tell you the truth, A letter of credit would increase the cost of my import. When I open a letter of credit with a bank, I have to pay a deposit. That'll tie up my money and increase my cost.
Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum.
Still, There will be bank charges in connection with the credit. It would help me greatly if you would acceptD / A orD / P. You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit. It makes no great difference to you, But it does to me.
Well, Mrs. Wang, You must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee. We always require L / C for our exports. And the other way round, We pay by L / C for our imports.
To meet you half way, What do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance byD / P?
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Wang. But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that. As I've said, We require payment by L / C.
It's a great honor to have you here, Mr. Brown.
I'd like to say goodbye to you.
I look forward to seeing you soon. Goodbye!
Yes, My house is far away from here. May I ask for an apartment?
No problem. We will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen...
That's great. Thank you so much.
I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions.
Homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution. Do you do anything to help them?
I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat. I figure that if they're homeless, They're probably hungry.
That's a good idea. Do they usually accept the food?
Almost always. However, Sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash.
It's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now.
The cost of living in London is just too high for most people.
It's true. The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment.
Did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage, Let alone pay for food and other living costs?
There just isn't enough affordable housing to go around. If only the housing cost would drop, Fewer people would be in financial trouble.
Added to that is the high unemployment rate right now.
Something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon.
Politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class. They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class.
I can only hope that one day they will change.
No, But the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked.
Do you have a history of high blood pressure?
No, I have never been told that I have high blood pressure.
High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms.
How do you check for high blood pressure?
We are going to use this cuff here, And it will give me a reading.
What do the numbers mean?
They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood.
Good. That will help me know how I am doing.
You can catch the 486.
That bus goes all the way to LA?
I believe so.
Is the bus ride long?
It only takes 45 minutes to an hour.
That's all?
It's a pretty short trip.
Is there always a lot of people on that bus?
It only gets crowded once it gets to LA.
Oh okay, Thank you.
No problem.
Oh, You know, Tomorrow is Vicky's birthday. I am thinking what gift to give her.
That's easy. A girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments. How about a hair pin?
It's a bad idea. Vicky has short hair.
Well, What about a brooch?
Only old women like that.
Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday.
Ok. That's what I can do.
This is Soft, May I speak to Lamely?
This is Lamely.
Hello, Lamley. Are you free tomorrow?
Yes.
Would you like to go to an activation with me?
I'd like to. See you tomorrow.
See you.
Certainly, Which color do you want to dye it?
I want the latest fashion, Can you make some suggestions?
Right now, Many girls are dyeing there hair blond.
I don't think that was suit me very well, Blond is kind of erratic.
What do you think about pink?
Oh, No. I think it's better to be a natural chinese, With natural chinese hair. Have you got good brand of hair dye?
Yes, We have several brands, Which one do you prefer?
I want the best one.
First, You need a shampoo, It makes it easier for your hair to be dyed. Let's down your hair in the water, You hair will be fairly clean that way.
After this dye job, It feels I look younger.
You hair is definitely fresh and shiner looking.
What do you want to speak to me about?
I want to talk about this year's election.
