 | Come on mom. I'm your A! Wait till the guys hear about this!
 | Can I see the paper when you're through, Sally?
 | Ok. I just want to read the comics.
 | Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age. It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier.
 | Fully agree. I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel. The latest office equipment is more type-functional. It combines fax machine, Copy machine and printer in one. It saves a lot of place, One machine instead of three.
 | Yes, This machine is even smaller than those before.
 | When will we get one of those?
 | Excuse me. What time does the next bus for Boston leave?
 | It leaves at 8: 30.
 | I see. Are there any seats available?
 | Just a moment, Please. Yes, You can have a seat.

 | A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob, He's been with the office for ages, So everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement.
 | Bob is retiring, Wow... That's news to me, I had no idea Bob was that old, Retirement's still sixty-five, Right?
 | Retirement age is still 65, But I think more and more people are retiring earlier, I think Bob's in upper fifties already, He just looks pretty young.
 | Wow... I thought he was early forty stops, Why would he want to retire so soon?
 | May I help you find something, Or are you just looking?
 | I'm just looking.
 | Then take your time, Please.
 | How do you like the food here?
 | I don't like it very much. But every-body likes their own food best.
 | There are many things I miss. You can't get the ingredients here.
 | Are you sure? All the big cities have specialty shops, Which sell all sorts of ethnic foods.
 | Where can I get a good novel?
 | What are in this folder?
 | They are reports of our company.

 | No, They are filed according to dates.

 | Will you bring our bill, Please?
 | Yes, Certainly. I'll be back in a minute. Here you are.
 | Thanks. Let me see. I think there's a mistake on the bill here. Would you mind checking, Please?
 | Of course, Not. Let me check. Oh, You seem bo be correct.
 | How about tax and service charge?
 | Only ten percent tax is included in the bill.
 | Then one hundred U.S. Dollars covers everything, Doesn't it?
 | What's going on here?
 | You mean, What's happening? Well, Constable, I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me.
 | Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door?
 | Well, You see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry. Come on, Fred, We're wasting time.
 | Just a minute you two. I don't think you're telling me the truth. This isn't poorhouse, Is it?
 | No, It's my brother's. I'm staying with him for a while.
 | Is he at home?
 | What's Ron Marston like, Pauline?
 | He's awful! He telephoned me four times yesterday, And three times the day before yesterday. He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon. My boss answered the telephone.
 | What did your boss say to him?
 | He said, Pauline is typing letters. She can't speak to you now! "Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening. He telephoned again. But I didn't answer the phone!
 | Did he telephone again last night?
 | Yes, He did. He telephoned at nine o'clock.
 | What did you say to him?
 | I said, This is Pauline's mother. Please don't telephone my daughter again!
 | Did he telephone again?
 | Does this bus really go to the mall?
 | It goes all the way there.
 | Are you sure?
 | I know it does. I catch this bus a lot.
 | How long does it take for the bus to get there?
 | The bus ride is only thirty minutes or so.
 | Where do we get off the bus?
 | Right behind Macy's is a bus stop.
 | The stop is really at the mall?
 | It's in the middle of the parking lot.
 | That's perfect.
 | I really need to find a bus that goes by PCC.
 | Where do you need to catch this bus at?
 | All the way up on Las Flores Drive and Fair Oaks.
 | I can tell you what bus to catch, But you have to walk a little bit.
 | Walking isn't a problem for me.
 | The 267 stops at Altadena Drive and Fair Oaks.
 | Which direction do I want?
 | Get on the bus heading west.
 | Do you know where I get off at?
 | Del Mar and Hill.
 | Thanks for letting me know, Home-girl.
 | Mr. Chandler will be our new partner, So his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future, Because it may decide whether Mr. Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not. Do you have some idea?
 | I suppose we can bring him to visit our company, As well as our display room. In this way, He can know more about our company and our potential power. In my opinion, Visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much.
 | En, You are right, And he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon. But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret. On one hand, Show his our best side ; on the other hand, Do not show too much to protect our own business secrets.
 | Well, I understand.
 | Are you making what I think you're making?
 | Nothing but the best, Cinnamon toast.
 | What a nostalgic food!
 | Why the drama? Have you been watching soap operas?
 | No. Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown...
 | This is a nice place, But you need to get some furniture.
 | I had planned to. I can bring some from my place. And there's some more at my parents '..
 | Do you have a bed?
 | Of course, I have. There is one in my old house. And I have another one from college at my parents 'house.
 | That's good. You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room.
 | Yeah, It is a good idea. You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to.
 | Yeah. By the way, Can I take a shower?
 | Sure, But I don't have hot water, Yet.
 | Really?
 | No, They're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on. My phone should be working then, Too.
 | Well, Do you want to go outside for dinner?
 | Yeah, I can't cook anything until tomorrow, Anyway. Let's go to the restaurant nearby. It's my treat.
 | Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out.
 | The exact time? Let me think. You know, It happened at night.
 | But we need the exact time. What time?
 | Where's the nearest bank?
 | Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend. You wanna go?
 | Don't feel like it. I'm broke.
 | Well, We can still do some window shopping, Can't we?
 | Just look around? Ah, That's boring.
 | Boris, Look at this sentence. "Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies, Staying unrealistically thin, Or depriving yourself of foods you love." It's interesting, Isn't it?
 | I'd rather say it's confusing. What are those "strict nutrition philosophies" about?
 | I believe they are careful calculations on proteins, Vitamins and calories.
 | Probably, Iris. That must be the job of nutritionists.
 | Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves. So we are free to have whatever foods we love. It is unbelievable.
 | Oh, Believe it or not, I came across an article the other day, Saying that pizza is a healthy food.
 | Seriously?
 | Yes, I felt exactly the same way as you did just now. Scientists must be crazy in saying so.
 | Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet.
 | Absolutely. I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great. As long as I have enough energy, It's fine.
 | Who wants to go first? Lily?
 | Oh... I mostly just like to listen. You're the groom. Why don't you go first?
 | Ok. Put on something by the Backstreet Boys!
 | How about As Long as You Love Me? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke!
 | John, You have done a good job. Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests. They intend to sign contracts with our company. You really did a good job.
 | Thank you. I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users.
 | Hah, As the sale department director of our team, You are the best.
 | I am flattered. But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it. She asked me to her office.
 | Why not? You've done so well for the company. She should give you a prize.
 | I feel nervous when I face her. She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time.
 | Come on! What are you nervous about?
 | It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation.
 | But the sale number is close to the predicted amount.
 | I'm still nervous. I don't know what to say to the manager. I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place.
 | Can I help you, Miss?
 | Yes. I have just got lost with my firiend. Can you page my friend for me?
 | Ok, Tell me your friend's name.
 | I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview.
 | Make sure that you understand the company. Do you understand what it is that they do?
 | No, I probably need to do some more research.
 | When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed. Does that make sense?
 | I think that their attitude is rather casual.
 | So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear. Do you have something to wear?
 | I have absolutely nothing so far.
 | You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it, But can we talk about other basics?
 | Yes, Where should we go from here?
 | What can I do for you, Madam?
 | I'd like to buy a toy car for my son.
 | How about this one?
 | It looks nice. How much is it?
 | They're three hundred dollars.
 | Oh, I'm afraid it's too expensive. Can you show me something cheaper?
 | Ok, This one is one hundred and twenty. It's the cheapest here.
 | Ok, I'll take it. Here's the money.
 | Good morning. Could I speak to Frans Smith please?
 | Frans Smith? I think you may have the wrong number.
 | Is this Taiwan 8234342 2,Ds engineering?
 | It is. But there is no Frans Smith here. Do you know which department he works in?
 | The accounts department, I think.
 | How did you get it?
 | I found it a garage sale once.
 | What a find! So, How much does it cost?
 | Well, Because I like you... Ninety bucks.
 | What can I do for you?
 | I'm looking for the cameras.
 | Hey, Jack, I'd better go now.
 | Is your boss coming by?
 | Right! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p.M.
 | Okay. Get back to your work, And call me back this evening.
 | Okay, No problem. Bye!
 | I think we have everything in the contract. Shall we sign it?
 | Wait a minute. I think we have missed an important point. We should include an arbitration clause in the contract.
 | I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation.
 | I hope so. Too. But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us.
 | All right. I agree with you. But where do we hold arbitration?
 | I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country.
 | It sounds reasonable. The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way. If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation, The disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties.
 | Here we are, Ryan! This is where we're going to celebrate!
 | It's a ETV palace! I'm glad I brought my platinum card.
 | You won't need it. Stanley, My best man, Is going to treat everybody!
 | Where is Stanley? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV, Wasn't it?
 | If it were up to Stanley, We'd have the wedding in the ETV! He loves to sing.
 | Then I bet he's really good!
 | How nice these sunglasses are!
 | Yes, They are the latest designs. Would you like to try them on?
 | I want to try on this pair.
 | The round shape pair?
 | That's right.
 | I think it suits you well.
 | I agree, How much?
 | 120 yuan.
 | I am Liu Yi, From China XYZ Company. I'd like to see Mr. Thomas, Please.
 | Do you have an appointment, Mr. Liu?
 | No, I am afraid not. I just arrive in town today.
 | Mr. Thomas is quite busy, I'm afraid he won't be able to see you today.
 | Would you please ask when he will be free?
 | Hi, Bob.
 | How did you do on your driving test?
 | Passed.
 | Freeze! Police! Put your hands over your head!
 | What did I do? I haven't done anything.
 | You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs.
 | What do you mean?
 | You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs. So we are taking you into custody.
 | I didn't do anything.
 | We've found some heroin at your house.
 | No, I didn't. I'm innocent. Those aren't mine. Whatever you found is someone else's stuff. You can't prove anything. I wasn't there when you went in, And you can't prove it's my stuff.
 | That may be, But you're still under arrest. And you'd better stop talking.
 | I don't need your help, Jerk.
 | I know that you are interested in our washers.
 | Yes, We are thinking of placing an order. However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms, Including mode of payment, Discount and possible date of delivery.
 | We supply washers of all types and sizes. We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers.
 | We have read about this in your sales literature. Could you give us some idea of your prices?
 | Our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in Europe or anywhere else. Here are our latest price lists. You will see that our prices are very attractive.
 | Do you take special orders? That is, Do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients?
 | Sure, We do.
 | How long does it usually take you to make delivery?
 | As a rule, We deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C. It takes longer, Of course, For special orders. In no case would it take longer than six months.
 | Good. One more thing, We'd like you to quote us on CIF basis.
 | How much is it?
 | 6 500 yuan. You will get it on the price tag.
 | Its a little overpriced. Is there any discount on this laptop?
 | Its already very cheap. Let's make it 6 000 yuan.
 | I'd buy this if it were cheaper. How about 5 000 yuan?
 | Hum... I say 5 500 yuan. That's as cheap as it can get.
 | Is it the final price?
 | I'm sorry, This is our rock bottom price.
 | Hi, Excuse me. I am sorry to bug you, But do you know where the Royal Hotel is?
 | Just a minute. I am as busy as a bee right now... Ok, I am done. What can I do for you?
 | Well, I seem to be a little bit lost here. I am worried that I'll never find my way. What's worse. I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now.
 | Well, Keep you chin up! I'll try to help you. Where are you going?
 | I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel. Do you know where that is?
 | Yes, No problem. You walk down this street. You turn left at the first intersection. Walk along that road, Turn right at the corner. After that, You make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light. The Royal Hotel is on your right side.
 | Great. Are there any landmarks nearby?
 | Yeah, I think so. I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office. It is as plain as the hump on a camel. You can't miss it.
 | Oh, That's good. I should be able to find it pretty easily then. Is that far from here?
 | Yeah, It's gonna take you a while if you go by foot. I'd say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk. You have to be as strong as a lion to make it.
 | Oh, That will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry. Can I take a bus there?
 | Well, You could take a bus there, But you would have to transfer buses twice. A taxi would probably be a lot quicker.
 | All right. I guess I'll take a taxi then. How long will it take by taxi?
 | Not too long. It should take about ten mins by taxi.
 | Cool, Thanks.
 | Are you ready to order, Sir?
 | Yes. Can you show me the menu, Please?
 | Of course. Here you are.
 | Then, What's special tonight?
 | Our seafood is fresh. I recommend shrimp with garlic.
 | Mr. Emory? I'd appreciate it if you would look over these letters before you leave today.
 | I'd be glad to. Just leave them on my desk. I didn't expect you to finish so soon.
 | Thank you, Sir. I'll leave them here. If there are no problems, I'll mail them out this afternoon.
 | Hang out the clothes.
 | We'd like to rent a flat near the university.
 | Are you looking for somewhere for two people?
 | Yes, We are. Obviously, We'd like something as cheap as possible. We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month.
 | Yes, There are several place available in that price range near the university. Do you have any other requirements?
 | Net really, No. We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street.
 | How many rooms do you need in the flat?
 | We'll need two bedrooms. The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined.
 | Ok. I've got a list of place that fit your requirements. Let's just go through them. The first on the list costs 80 pounds a month, But it's on a noisy street and it's a little far fromt.
 | How far away is it from the campus?
 | It's about two miles away. That might be a little far to walk. Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus. The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street, Just off a.
 | That sounds ideal. Can we go to have a look at it? We'd like to see it before making a final decision.
 | Of course. I'm not very busy at the moment. If you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes. I can take you there.
 | I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow, And I think I must go on a diet.
 | You are just a little bit chubby, Not paunchy.
 | You know, I'm a compulsive overeater. I got to watch what I eat.
 | More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down.
 | May I speak to Mr. Thomas?
 | Unfortunately, He has left for the day.
 | I hate to trouble of you. But it is urgent. Please leave this message into him.
 | Did you even bother to go to school today?
 | Yeah, I went. Did you go?
 | No, I didn't feel like it.
 | That's nice, Have you been to the movies lately?
 | No, But that was a random change of subject.
 | It may have been random, But have you?
 | I haven't lately.
 | I would love to catch a movie this weekend.
 | So then, Why don't you just go?
 | I don't want to see a movie by myself.
 | Okay, So are you going to school tomorrow?
 | The bartender just gave the last call. Let's order another round, Okay?
 | Sure, But let's get a pitcher this time. We should be able to down it before they close.
 | That sounds good. You order the beer while I go to the bathroom. Where is the can in this place?
 | It's all the way to the back. See that yellow door?
 | Yeah. I think I can find it.
 | You're back already. That sure was quick.
 | That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around. That bathroom is too gross for me.
 | Well, The bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer. Anyway. He said it was too close to closing time.
 | Let's leave then. I could take some fresh air, Anyway.
 | May I have the menu, Please?
 | Oh. I am sorry, Here you are. May I suggest our lunch special?
 | Could I have a few more minutes?
 | Oh great! This stupid computer froze again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, Can you come take a look at my PC? It's acting again. It must have a virus or something.
 | I ran a virus scan on your computer, And it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!
 | But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked a virus.
 | Well, You have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly. Yours wasn't up to date, That's probably what was causing your problems.
 | Ok. Anything else?
 | Yeah, Try not to kick or hit the computer!
 | I want to reserve a VIP room at 7:00 this evening.
 | Ok, Sir. How many people are there in your party?
 | 8. Is your VIP room big enough for 8 persons?
 | May, Look at this mess! You threw waste everywhere.
 | Do you have any experience working with a computer?
 | Yes. I have been a data entry operator for three years.
 | What kind of software can you use?
 | I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos. Actually, I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages.
 | Do you have any other computer qualifications?
 | Yes, I have an ACRE certificate, Bank 2.
 | Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information?
 | Can you believe her? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet.
 | Tell me about it. If I was as small as her, I wouldn't think about going on a diet.
 | Me too. But what are we going to do? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight.
 | That's because you don't exercise. If you were more active, You wouldn't have a dieting problem.
 | What do you know? You are over weight too.
 | I'm not on a diet though.
 | I know. But I don't have someone to diet with. If we help each other and motivate each other, Then I think we can lose some weight.
 | I like ice cream too much though.
 | C'mon. You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there.
 | It does sound appealing.
 | It's a great idea. I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier. Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed.
 | Okay. I'm in. Let's do it.
 | Great. I'll get our plan started right away.
 | Excuse me, Is this the right counter for express mail?

 | Yes.
 | Where will we call at?
 | Dalian.
 | Dalian is my hometown.
 | Really?
 | Can I get off the ship and walk around?
 | Jodi, I must get a hold of Jim today, But I forgot his address and phone number.
 | Don't worry about it. I have his pager number right here.
 | Really? You'Ve helped me a lot. Thank you.
 | Does this TV work well?
 | Yes, It is almost new here.
 | Is it a color TV or a black and white TV?
 | I came in response to your advertisement for a salesperson.
 | Ok, Please be seated. May I have your name, Please?
 | My name is Woody.
 | Ok, Woody. Why are you interested in this job?
 | Because I admire your company. Yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city.
 | Have you worked anywhere else before?
 | Yes, Five years ago. I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai. Two years ago, I came to Beijing, And worked in a department store as a salesman.
 | Ok, Your work experience is impressive, And I think you sound right for this position, But I do have 3 other people to interview, So you'll be hearing from us within a week.
 | You should save some money on parking here.
 | Yeah, I don't have to pay for a space on the street.
 | Really? How long did it take you to find a spot yesterday?
 | Well, Last night it took me half an hour to find a spot when I came home from work.
 | You get home late, Don't you?
 | Yeah, Around seven. Most of the street parking is gone by then.
 | Ah, Well. You can't have everything.
 | How about this opera given by the famous musician?
 | Foreign Currency Deposits Counter, Yes. What can I do for you?
 | You see, I have these Euros, And of course they are of no use to me at the moment. So I'd like to save them in my account, But I'm not sure how to go about it.
 | Ok. We offer 2 types of saving systems, Time Savings and Demand Savings. With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time, But with Demand Savings your money is 'on demand', You can withdraw at any time.
 | I see. What's the interest like on those?
 | There's quite a large difference. I mean, If you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0. 13 % interest, But for a time deposit, Of say, 1 year we would offer 0. 82 %.
 | Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening.
 | You're welcome.
 | It looks delicious.
 | We wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes.
 | We are interested in this field.
 | Good morning, Mr Wang.
 | Good morning. What time is it now?
 | It's just nine o'clock.
 | I'm on time today.
 | Yes, You're on time. Are you often late?
 | Yes, Quite often.
 | You must leave home earlier today.
 | No, I left home at 6:30 as usual.
 | Why are you so early today?
 | What can I do for you?
 | I need to make a deposit.
 | Are you depositing cash or a check?
 | I'm depositing a check.
 | Please sign the back of the check.
 | There you go.
 | Do you want cash back?
 | Yes, Please.
 | How much cash would you like?
 | I want $ 150.
 | Here's your $ 150.
 | When do you plan to deliver the goods?
 | This weekend.
 | Please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment.
 | May I ask you a few questions about insurance?
 | Yes.
 | Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates. What insurance rate do you suggest we should get?
 | Well. Obviously, You won't want All Risks cover.
 | Why not?
 | Because they aren't delicate goods and won't likely be damaged on the voyage. FPA will be good enough.
 | Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average.
 | That's right. On the other hand, A WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases.
 | Are there any other clauses in marine policies?
 | Oh, Lots of them. For instance, War Risks,TEND andSICC.
 | Well, Thank you very much for all that information. Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now?
 | Are you going to make an offer today?
 | Yes. My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates.
 | Ok, I'll get this rate right away.
 | Would you show me some table-cloths?
 | Certainly. ( Take a table-cloth to her )..
 | How much is it?
 | A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan.
 | That's reasonable.
 | If you take good care of it, It will last you quite a number of years.
 | I need help finding a gift for my daughter.
 | Would she like a laptop?
 | That sounds like a good idea.
 | A Mac is a very popular brand.
 | She mentioned a Mac. How much is it?
 | A 15 - inch Pro model is $ 2, 100 plus tax.
 | That sounds like a great price. I'll take one.
 | This is a gift she'll cherish for years. How do you want to pay?
 | I'll use my VISA.
 | We're almost through. Just sign here, Please.
 | Just take it home and plug it in?
 | She'll be online 20 minutes after she opens the box.
 | She's going to be so pleased with this.
 | Hi there! My name's Terry Graham. You're new around here, Huh?
 | Yes. My name's Mark Benson. I just started a couple of weeks ago.
 | Well, If there's anything I can do for you, Let me know.
 | Union Bank. How can I be of service?
 | I need to know how much money is in my account.
 | I'll need your name and account number.
 | You look upset. What's wrong?
 | Nothing. It's just one of those days. Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done.
 | Maybe you need a vacation or something, Or maybe a bonus.
 | I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right.
 | Why don't you talk to your boss about it? If you talk to him, He will surely understand.
 | What type do you have in your mind?
 | A compact please. What's the daily rate for that car?
 | Thirty dollars a day.
 | Does the rate include the cost of gas?
 | Doctor, I feel much better now. Will I be albe to go home some time this week?
 | That's good to hear. You've had an ideal recovery from your operation. We're going to send you home tomorrow.

 | You'd better have a good rest for a week. Be sure to have regular meals. Stay away from alcohol. Give up smoking at least a little while.
 | Should I take some medicine?

 | Would you like to Come to our barbecue?
 | Yes, That sounds wonderful.
 | Ok. See you then.
 | But wait, Wait, Will there be food that is not meat? You know. I'm a vegetarian.
 | Hey! I didn't know that! When did you become a vegetarian?
 | The other day, I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian. And you know what? I don't miss the taste of meat.
 | Relly? That's amazing.
 | Yes, It really is. After having vegetarian diet. I have much more energy, I need less sleep, I feel calmer. I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly.
 | Are you kidding? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet.
 | Yes, Maybe. But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian. Maybe you could also have a try.
 | Maybe I'll also have a try some day, But I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat.
 | Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet.
 | Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?
 | Just say the word, Sir.
 | Excellent! Now, As you know, The day has barely begun.
 | I agree. The dew is still on the grass.

 | Ok, We'll send someone up to check it.
 | I'm going out right now. But that's all right, You can come when I've gone.
 | May I help you?
 | Yes, I'm looking for Bob.
 | He's in a meeting with Phil.
 | Excuse me, Mr. Macmillan?
 | Yes, Ms. Ross? What do you need?
 | I was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation. I want to enter a Master's program in marketing. It's all on weekends and evenings.
 | Welcome to Galant. How can I help you?
 | Hi. I would like to get an internet plan for my house.
 | Of course. We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from. The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month. This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps.
 | I have no idea what kbps means. I just want to be able to get online, Play games and chat with my friends. Oh, And watch movies online as well.
 | Well, This connection might be a bit too slow for your needs. I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes. That way you can play games online without any lag. This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free!
 | Do I have to pay an installation fee?
 | Lucky for you, This month we aren't charging our normal installation fee. You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there! And we'll throw in this pen drive!
 | Mr. Crane's office. Sandy speaking. May I help you?
 | Hi, Sandy. It's Walter Knight. I need to book some time with Mr. Crane.
 | Certainly, Mr. Knight. When would you like to meet with him?
 | Tell me about yourself and your past experience.
 | For the past 3 years, I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited. I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths. I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member.
 | Why are you interested in this occupation?
 | It's always been my dream to be a stewardess. And I like travelling to different places.
 | What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess?
 | Well, A stewardess should be friendly, Courteous, Patient and treat passengers kindly and politely.
 | Do you get angry easily?
 | No, I know how to control my temper.
 | If a passenger had a accident, What would you do?
 | I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time.
 | If you are hired, When can you start work?
 | I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now.
 | What are your salary expectations?
 | I love your little Lulu dolls. How much for a batch of 6, 000?
 | For a batch of 6, 000 we would charge two dollars a doll. Your total cost would be $ 12, 000.
 | That's a little steep for our company. Do you offer any discounts?
 | Well, We'd like to work with you. If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little. Can you increase your order to 15, 000?
 | Hmmm. It wouldn't be easy, But if the discount makes it worthwhile, We can consider it. How much of a discount would that give us?
 | For order of 12, 000 or more we charge only $ 1. 5 a doll. Your total cost would be $ 18, 000.
 | So, For an additional 6, 000 dollars, We get twice as many dolls? That still might be a little hard. Couldn't you discount it further? We'Ve been pricing other suppliers, And this discount might.
 | We do value your business. I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 %?
 | I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank.
 | That's no problem at all, But could you fill in this and I'll need to see some ID.
 | Here you go. Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in?
 | Yes, There needs to be at least 1 RIB paid in to open a new account. Also, You will need to choose a secret identity code to ensure no one else can enter your account.
 | Ok, How long does it need to be? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers.
 | Hello, So how are we feeling today?
 | Things are going well for me, Dr. Smith.
 | Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical?
 | Yes, I am applying for new health insurance, And I need a physical examination to qualify.
 | Your basic physical exam will include lungs, Heart, Blood levels, And eyes, Ears, And nose.
 | I'Ve been having a little trouble breathing. Would you look into that, Please?
 | We can do an allergy test, And later I can send you for an asthma test.
 | I would appreciate it. When you give me a blood test, What are you looking for?
 | I am going to check your cholesterol, Blood sugar, And white blood cell count.
 | Is anybody here?
 | Coming. What do you want today?
 | Quite a lot. I need one pound of potatoes, Three pints of milk, A dozen eggs and one pound of tomatoes.
 | Our fruit is very fresh today. Do you want some?

 | Yes. Natural pearls or cultured pearls? We have both kinds.
 | I wonder which looks more lustrous.
 | Well, Natural pearls are of higher value, But the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful.
 | I hope we could offer the most favorable terms.
 | I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive. Here is our offer. All the prices on the list are firm. If your order is a sizeable one, We could reconsider our prices.

 | My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company.
 | It's great!
 | My aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now, And she wants me to give it a try.
 | This is a good opportunity.
 | One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview.
 | You can give it a try! May be you will succeed.
 | I know. Let me think it over.
 | If you have any good jobs, Keep an eye for me!
 | Daddy, I love this Happy Farmhouse. It's really fun.
 | Great. But no talking, Now. Don't forget that you are on a ladder. Take care!
 | But you are holding it for me. Nothing to worry about. I trust you. Oops, What's that?
 | Don't touch it with your stick. It's a bumble bees 'hive. Get down the ladder. Be quick.
 | What would happen if they started attacking you?
 | You can get killed. No kidding. Remember, Never stir up a hive.
 | I see. Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket?
 | It's for fun. And also, The apples here are Green Food.
 | Come on, Daddy. You can see that people only pick the red ones.
 | Silly boy. Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals, Fertilizers, And pesticides.
 | Oh, Then what would happen if there were pests?

 | Yeah, But sometimes Bingo wants to play with me, But I don't have time.
 | So who takes care of him then?
 | My little brother likes to play with him. He even gives him a bath every week.
 | I can't do that with my cat. She hates water.
 | Mm, They taste delicious. Let's settle the bill.
 | Yes. Let's go Dutch.

 | Great. How much is this going to cost?
 | Well, It depends. Do you want to send it via priority, Express or standard mail?

 | Well, What do you have in mind?
 | How about the Mongolian hot pot?
 | Oh, It's too spicy for me. Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb? It Was so spicy my eyes teared up!
 | Maybe we can try 'Yuanyang pot' this time. You can choose the non-spicy soup base.
 | Sounds great. Do they serve noodles? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well.
 | Yes. The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines.
 | Great. Let's go!
 | What kind of films do you like best?

 | Oh, I don't know... It's hard to find the right nanny. You have to consider her previous work experience, The responsibilities you give her, And how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, Though.
 | I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, And you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

 | Ok, Well, We're going to make a pan of lasagne, A salad, And some garlic bread. Here's the recipe. Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard?
 | Sure. We should probably pre-heat the oven right away, Too.
 | That's a good idea. Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius?
 | That's a bit high for lasagne. I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there.
 | Fine. I'll just get out the casserole dish, The saucepan, The salad bowl, And the baking sheet.
 | You know, I could do this myself. Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better?

 | Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year, Right?
 | But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec. 25.
 | Well. I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment. Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment.

 | Ok, So can I say, "This is Abby's voicemail. I will call you later, So leave me your name and number"..
 | That's more or less the idea, But try something that sounds more friendly.
 | Ok, So how about this, "This is Abby and I am really happy you called! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, So please leave me your name and number. Talk to you soon!"..
 | A little too friendly Abby. Just say this, "Hi, You have reached Abby. I am unable to answer your call right now, But if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks"..

 | I guess you're right. I've tried stopping, But I just can't seem to quit.
 | Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day? How many do you smoke each day now?
 | I smoke around 30 each day.
 | Ok. So for one month, Reduce the number you smoke by one a day. At the end of the month, You'll have quit. You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning. You don't need to jog far.
 | If I do a few exercises at home, Like crunches, I'll soon deal with this waistline.
 | Be careful when you go jogging. Don't put yourself under too much stress. You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition.
 | I'll join a fitness centre. I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice. There's one near my office, So I can go before and after work. I don't want to go jogging in the street, So I'll use a treadmill.

 | Excuse me, I want to know the price of your CPU.

 | It's rather too high. If you can make it cheaper, We will be able to place large orders continuously.
 | If you order a large amount, We can give you a discount.
 | Well, Can you explain it to me?
 | The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1, 000 Units.
 | Can you reduce more?
 | I'm sorry, But to be frank, Considering exploiting the market in your country, We have already supplied you at very low preferential price.
 | In that case, We have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made. Please reconsider.
 | It is so hard to deal with.
 | If you can give us a more reduction, We'd be able to give you an order on the spot.
 | Can I help you, Sir?
 | Yes, I want to buy some grapes.

 | Would you care much about your salary?
 | Salary is, Admittedly, Important, But I will care more about what I can learn from the job.
 | If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested, Would you take it or not?
 | I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it. What's worse, I just don't trust those vehicle maintenance shops. Sometimes, They overcharge or don't build those parts I have been paying for. Last week, They even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed. You know, My car is just half a year old and also good brand. I was just wondering about all these.
 | There are such shops living on selling parts. I don't like their service either. All they want is your money. But in the long run, They will be losing costumers. Anyway, Car service business is new in China. We all have to control what they are doing. Otherwise, They will not improve.

 | What are the side effects from taking that drug,
 | You need to stay hydrated on this drug, But most people experience little side effects.

 | For now I want you to take a second drug, Lisinopril, An ACE inhibitor.
 | Am I going to experience any complications with that drug?
 | Where are you going for lunch?
 | I have no idea. I have no appetite.
 | I know of a restaurant. I'm sure you'll like it.

 | How much is a round-trip ticket to London?
 | When did you plan to go, Sir?
 | In the second week of September.
 | The second week of September is still in the high-season, So the cheapest tickets are $ 650. The high season lasts until the 15th, So fares after that date are cheaper.

 | Our cheapest ticket is $ 550 on American Airlines.

 | This is your room. What do you think of it?
 | It's quiet and clean. I love the color scheme.
 | We have the room color designed for our guest.
 | Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background.
 | I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field. My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, Where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, And as a result, My writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used.
 | What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession?
 | Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, And it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, Explained my situation, And got their input.
 | Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description?
 | There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week. Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks, My boss and I stayed until 2 a.M. For two nights before the final wrap up. It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results. My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort.
 | Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome.
 | I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, Which she and I discussed and eventually resolved. My boss was impressed with the work I had done.
 | What are your strengths and weaknesses?
 | My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs. As far as weaknesses, I really enjoy my work, And sometimes I put in too much time. But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more.
 | Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss.
 | I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves. I asked her if I could talk with her one day, And we had a good discussion. It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure. I took the time to explain the procedures, And there haven't been any problems since that day.
 | When do you find a job satisfying?
 | My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job. When I first started as a paralegal, I had a lot to learn. But through hard work, Advice from some good mentors and continuing education, I have come a long way. I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner.
 | How would your coworkers describe you?
 | First, They'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. I really enjoy working with people. Secondly, They'll say I had great customer service skills. I put the customer first. And thirdly, They'll say that I know the law. I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously.
 | Do you have any questions?
 | Where do you want to go?
 | I am going to the Capital Hotel.
 | Get in. I will take you there.
 | About how much it will cost?
 | $ 50.
 | On the meter?
 | Ye, Of course.
 | I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college. I assume you haven't had any working experience. Is that right?
 | That's right. I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores.
 | Well, Experience is not important in this job. We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller. By the way, Do you like to work with figures?
 | Yes, I liked math in school.
 | We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures. Do you like meeting the public?
 | Yes, I enjoy working with people.
 | We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with. You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you. He would be responsible for training you. Have you studied English conversation?
 | Yes, I had an American tutor for two years. I had two lessons under her every week. Would I be using English every day is this job?
 | Yes, Many of our customers are Americans, So you would be speaking English with most of them. Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts?
 | No, I'm afraid I don't. I'd be glad to learn.
 | Would you mind doing something for me?
 | I would if I could.
 | Will you please explain the meaning of this word?
 | What games do you like?
 | I like word games.
 | How about a game of bridge?
 | I don't like it at all.
 | What about guessing games?
 | I'm not one for the games.
 | Let's play other game.
 | What about playing go?
 | Excuse me. Could you tell me where the post office is?
 | Sure. If you get on this road and turn left at the second intersection, You'll see it on your right-hand side.
 | Thank you so much for your assistance!
 | Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here, Too.
 | Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight?
 | No, I'm going to leave the office early today. My annual medical check-up is this afternoon.
 | How much longer will Mr. Schmidt be up in the mountains?
 | Can you work over tonight?
 | Sorry, I'm supposed to be with my son.
 | Okay, I'll ask Bob to cover it.
 | What do we need for the barbecue?
 | Well, I'Ve bought a lot of meat. I'Ve got pork chops, Small steaks, Chicken wings, And plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties.
 | I can't wait to start cooking! I'Ve bought the grill and charcoal. Do you have enough plates and utensils?
 | I think so. I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use. It will save on the washing up!
 | And if people drop them, They won't break. We'll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers.
 | They sell them at the shop around the corner. We can go and get some in a few minutes.
 | I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs. We'll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce.
 | I have the sauce, But remind me to get some ketchup at the shop.
 | How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue?
 | It only takes a few minutes. Some people like their meat well done. Others like it rare. The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked.
 | They can cook it themselves to make sure it's exactly how they like it.
 | How would you describe your ideal job?
 | I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained, And offer me opportunity for advancement.
 | Why do you think you might like to work for our company?
 | I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested. What's more, Your company is outstanding in this field.
 | What makes you think you would be a success in this position?
 | My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job. I am sure I will be successful.
 | How do you know about this company?
 | Why are you leaving your present job?
 | I'm not so satisfied with it.
 | Why do you plan to change your job?
 | I'm now a secretary in my present work unit. My work is not interesting. I have to type, Make copies, Book tickets and so on. Everyday I follow the routine. Furthermore, I have studied English for four years at university, But I can't use it there. They are the reasons I plan to change my job.
 | Why are you interested in working with this company?
 | Where are you from?
 | I'm from Germany.
 | So you speak German, Don't you?
 | Yeah, But I can speak English, Too.
 | Oh, I see. What other languages can you speak?
 | A little French.
 | Did I do well on my test?
 | Do you want to know the honest answer?
 | Why wouldn't I want to know?
 | You had pretty bad scores.
 | Exactly what do you mean by bad?
 | You failed.
 | How'd I fail it?
 | There are a couple of reasons why you didn't pass.
 | What did I do wrong?
 | To sum it all up, You really just don't know how to drive.
 | Thanks. Will I be able to take a retest?
 | Does it look like a good fit?

 | No problem.

 | I certainly did. Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend?
 | Sure.
 | How did the business trip go?
 | Well, To be honest, Nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss.
 | I understand. The last time I went on a business trip with the boss, I didn't even have enough to eat!
 | I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses. I spent half of the weekend on a train! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets!
 | Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes.
 | I see. Well, Then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip. It was reallytiring for me.
 | I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today.
 | Thank you. I can't imagine getting much done today. I'm just too exhausted!
 | No problem. Did you bring any gifts back for your department?
 | To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 707 to New York City?
 | Go to Gate 56, The plane is now boarding, You must hurry.
 | Show me the fastest way to get there.
 | Instead of walking you can take this shuttle to get you there faster.
 | Do you think the plane will leave without me?
 | No, I will call the attendants at the gate. I'll tell them you are on your way.
 | Thank you so much, I would really appreciate that.
 | Would you cash these travelers 'checks, Please?
 | How would you like them?

 | Okay, I'll do that, But my crown was just put on last year. Will my dental insurance cover the work?
 | Since you had that done here, We'll take care of it. There won't be a charge. And, Your insurance should cover the work on the cavity. Now, I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work.

 | Hello Mary. I haven't seen you for ages. Are you still seeing Paul?
 | No. We broke up last month. I'm taking a break from dating for a while.
 | Did you break up amicably? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up.
 | We just decided to stop seeing each other. It was all very amicable. Are you still going out withmike?
 | Yes, I am. We're thinking about getting engaged. We'Ve been dating for over a year now.
 | Good for you! Have you seen Kelly recently? Is she still dating nick?
 | I havn't seen her for a while. She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her. He was seeing a girl form his office. One day, She saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately.
 | She was right to do that. I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon.
 | Really? They'Ve been together for a long time. When are they getting married?
 | I think it's 26th September. I'll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night.
 | Thanks. Hey, Look at that guy over there. I think he fancies you.
 | We did a survey on your job performance.
 | How did I do?
 | Not so good. Lots of complains.
 | Really? I thought I was doing well.
 | Hi Mike. What have you been up to?
 | Not much. I started exercising.
 | Trying to get in shape?
 | Yeah, And I need to start improving my health.
 | Me too. What are you doing besides exercising?
 | That's about all.
 | I think if you eat better, It will help tremendously.
 | Sleep is good too. I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems.
 | Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy.
 | I am keen on a coat on www. Dingding. Com. But it requires having an online banking account. Is it necessary?
 | Indeed. Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping.
 | Do you know how to get the bank account?
 | Bring your ID card and fill out a form. That will be fine.

 | Is there a doctor here?
 | No.
 | Can you call an Ambulance?
 | Please forgive me for rushing into your room forgetting to knock at the door.
 | Never mind.
 | I'm so sorry to disturb you so early.

 | Oh, It's nothing.
 | I let you down. I'll make it up to you somehow.
 | Can you help me for a minute?
 | Sure, What I can do for you?
 | I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients, But I just don't know exactly what to say, I don't even know how to get started, I know I should write dear Mr. Mrs. Or Ms., But the problem is I don't know the name of contact person.
 | You can just put Dear Sir or Madam, Officialese not personal, You can write to whom may concerned.
 | Ok, So I first thanks them for their business, I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support, How is that?
 | Good! But also, Write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing, Give them more reference.
 | Like Regarding our new product line, We would like to announce a special price discount.
 | Right, Do you need them to respond?
 | Yes, The letter would have a survey inside, And they should complete it and return to our office. How should I write that?
 | What can I help you with?
 | I need to hire you.
 | What do you need me for?
 | I need you for my court date.
 | What kind of case do you have?

 | What is your price?
 | I charge $ 150 an hour.
 | I can't afford that.
 | That's my rate.
 | How much do you pay wholesale for your products?
 | We have a few different wholesale vendors, So our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year. But the difference is miniscule, A fluctuation of about 0. 2 %.
 | That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit, Doesn't it? After all, Your sticker price is pretty much set in stone. How much do they go for retail?
 | Retail price is 29. 95 per unit. We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price.
 | Is that including tax?
 | No, That's the price before tax. The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas, So it is difficult for us to figure in.
 | How much is your profit margin then?
 | Have you any idea of the prices of ruby and diamond?
 | I'm not very sure. But I know ruby is less valuable than diamond.
 | How do you know that?
 | Hoo, I'm getting tired, Jeanine, Been a long day.
 | I'm not quitting yet. You know my favourite slogan, Don't you?
 | Yeah, I know. Shop till you drop.

 | Sure does. Hey, Can I sponge a little cash of you?
 | Don't worry, Marian, I've got you covered.
 | Hey, What are you doing here?
 | I'm just shopping.
 | What are you shopping for?
 | Some new clothes. How about you?
 | Same here.
 | Have you found anything nice yet?
 | I found a few pairs of pants.
 | Where'd you get those?
 | I found them at Pennies.
 | Those are really cute.
 | Do you want me to show you where I found them?
 | Have you thought of moving at all Sarah?
 | We'Ve thought about it, But my husband and I can't afford it right now. The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums, Which is something I don't want to do.
 | Buying a house can be expensive, But there are ways to find cheaper houses.
 | Like what?
 | Well, Sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community. You'd have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day, But you would definitely save money doing it that way.
 | That's a good idea. Do you know anyone who has done that before?
 | Sure, My sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way. They're pretty satisfied with it.
 | Is the house pretty run-down.
 | Not at all. The woman, Who owned it,Took good care of it. But when she died, She had no family left and no will, So the government had to sell it for her.
 | Was it very old house?
 | It was about 75 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing, But it didn't take a lot of money or time.
 | Is it in a good location?
 | Welcome to Super Stereos. What can I do for you?
 | I'd like to look at your stereo systems. Do you have anything on sale?
 | Yes, This system over here is on sale for $ 1, 000. As you can see, All of the components are brand-name.
 | But it doesn't have a turntable. I have a fair number of vinyl records, So I need something to play them on.
 | I was wondering if I could collect unemployment benefits.
 | Did you get laid off?
 | I am still working for now, But I might get laid off.
 | You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off.
 | Does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment?
 | No, Some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment.
 | How can I find out if I can collect?
 | Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect.
 | How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment?
 | You look tired.
 | Yeah, I'Ve been working so much overtime lately.
 | Really? How come?
 | My boss gave me a big project. I had to have it finished it by this morning. It was so difficult!
 | You shouldn't work so hard.
 | I know. But hard work pays off, You know.
 | What do you mean?
 | Good afternoon, Mr. Anderson.
 | Good afternoon, Miss Li.
 | How nice to see you again!
 | Nice to see you, Too.
 | It's been a long time, Hasn't it? How are you?
 | Fine, Thank you. And you?
 | Very well too, Is there anything I can do for you?
 | Yes. Could you guide me to where I can change money?
 | Sure, Mr. Anderson, Please come along with me.
 | Thank you.
 | What kind of music do you like?
 | I like popular music best.
 | Me too.
 | Who is your favorite singer?
 | Qi In is.
 | Do you know this song?
 | Yes, I like it very much.
 | Let's sing it together, Shall we?
 | When would you like me to send those plans over to your office, Mr. Montgomery?
 | It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon, Ms. Barkley.
 | That shouldn't be a problem. What is the exact address, Again?
 | I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop.
 | Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, And a prompt will tell you the payment options.
 | Well, I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless service.
 | That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, If you want to hear them.
 | Yes, Please! Tell me about the alternatives.
 | We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor.
 | Very good. How much does that cost?
 | The service is free to hotel patrons. However, Printing costs ten cents per page.
 | I see. And the other alternatives?
 | Alternatively, We do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop down here.
 | Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?
 | Well, I'm glad you're finally back. I was wondering what happened.
 | I feel kind of stupid.
 | Why?
 | We got lost coming back. I guess I don't really know this town yet.
 | You got lost. You're kidding!
 | No. We took a wrong turn somewhere. And Joseph doesn't know the town at all. So I started giving him directions. But I didn't really know where we were. So we got seriously lost.
 | You could have called.
 | I know I could have. But finally we asked someone where we were.
 | You've been gone for two hours. How could you get lost for so long?
 | Guess where we ended up.
 | I don't know. Where?
 | When we finally decided to ask someone, They told us we were in Grangerfield.
 | Grangerfield! You were in Grangerfield? That's a completely different town! How could you drive to a completely different town?
 | I don't know. The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here.
 | Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here.
 | I know it is. I don't know how it happened.
 | Hmm, Maybe I do.
 | What?
 | Maybe I have an idea how it happened.
 | How?
 | You were too busy looking at Joseph, And you weren't paying attention to the road.
 | Oh, That's what you think, Huh?
 | Yes, That's what I think. Maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries, You'll get lost for even longer. Maybe six hours or so.
 | You know what, Trish?
 | What?
 | I hope so. I really hope so.
 | Hah, Hah! See? I guessed right. You weren't watching the road at all.
 | What do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom?
 | Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students 'initiative and creativeness, Instead of taking their rights away from speaking.
 | What did you do to put it into practice?
 | Why did your parents make you stay at home?
 | They wanted to go out, And so they made me look after my baby brother.
 | Didn't you mind doing it?
 | No, I didn't. My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework.
 | Didn't you even want to go to the cinema?
 | Not really. I watched television for an hour.
 | What was on television last night?
 | Boxing. It was excellent.
 | Oh. I enjoy watching boxing on television, Too. What a pity I missed it last night!
 | What did you do last night?
 | Hello sir, May I help you?
 | Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.
 | I see. Well, You have come to the right place. We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers.
 | Sounds good. I don't want it to be too expensive, Maybe something mid-range.
 | We have this new ETC smart phone. It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications. It also has a built-in camera,Mp3 player and touch screen. It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.
 | What about Wi-fi?
 | Of course! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.
 | Can you change American dollars into French francs?
 | Yes. How much do you want?
 | Fifty dollars. What is the exchange rate today?
 | One dollar to five francs. Is that all right?
 | Yes, Please. And you can cash my traveler's check, Can't you?
 | Of course, We can.
 | I want to be here tomorrow. What are your business hours?
 | 10 o'clock in the morning to 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
 | Thank you.
 | We like your product, And are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible.
 | Well, We can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays. Our factories will be closed for another week.
 | That's all right. We will send you a purchase order in one week. I hope you will be able to take care of it.
 | No problem. Once we get your purchase order, We will begin the execution of the order right away.
 | Thanks. We need the products in less than one month, Because we have a big deal with another company. By the way, Will payment against delivery be OK?
 | Hello. May I speak to David?
 | Who?
 | David Bush.
 | There's nobody here by that name.
 | What would you like to order, Sir?
 | I'd like to try some Chinese food.
 | We serve different styles of Chinese food here. But I'm not sure which one do you prefer.
 | I have no idea. Could you recommend some to me?
 | Well. Cantonese food is rather light, Beijing food is heavy, AndSichuan food is usually hot and spicy.
 | Oh, I see. I'd like to have hot food.
 | If so, I suggest you have a taste forSichuan food. MostSichuan dishes are spicy and hot, But they have different tastes.
 | Really? So do you have some specialties?
 | Yes. Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties.
 | Hi, Dave. You're early.
 | So you knew it was me?
 | I had an idea.
 | Look, Before we get into the secret admirer thing, I want to talk to you about WebTracker.
 | I'm sorry. I know you feel betrayed.
 | So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker?
 | Want to send out for some Chinese?
 | Some what?
 | Some Chinese food. I'm hungry, And there's a take-out restaurant near here. We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat.
 | No, I'd rather go out. The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home. Maybe we can try some other food today... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day, The one over in the shopping center?
 | Okay. I could go for that. It's called Al's Steakhouse. They also have great fried fish, And I love their salad bar. You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like.
 | Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat?
 | Yes, Their steaks are enormous. Sometimes I can't finish what I'Ve ordered.
 | What if that happens to me? I hate to let food go to waste.
 | We're leaving now.
 | Here's your bill.
 | Right. And would you please forward our mail to this address?
 | Certainly.
 | Thank you. Goodbye.
 | Good afternoon, Sir, Is there anything I can do for you?
 | Yes. I can't find my sweater. I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done. I find my swatter missing.
 | Well, It's our fault. We are sorry for that. Would you please fill out the form? We will pay for you.
 | What should I prepare for the recruitment fair?
 | You should wear a formal dress and be confident.
 | What application materials should I take?
 | Who finances the magazine?
 | I don't know exactly. I only hear it's financed by a famous film star.
 | Does it have a large circulation?
 | I'll have sole, Then.
 | All right. How about other guests?
 | The rest of us will have this today's special, Please.
 | Ok.
 | I'm sorry but I ordered sole, Not the same as the others. Will you change it?
 | I'm afraid we have no more sole.
 | Then, I'll have this pork cute instead.
 | You will never guess where my family is going for summer vacation.
 | Let me try. It has to be somewhere amazing, And far away... Egypt?
 | How in the world did you guess that? Did someone tell you already?
 | Yes. I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store.
 | I want to ride a camel and definitely see the pyramids!
 | I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours.
 | It helps that my dad is an archaeologist.
 | I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me.
 | No problem. What do you want me to get?
 | Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get.
 | Did you forget to put anything on the list?
 | I don't think I forgot anything.
 | Would you like me to go anywhere else for you?
 | If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription.
 | Has your prescription been filled yet?
 | Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready.
 | Sure, I'll go get it for you.
 | Thank you.
 | Hello. I would like to make a reservation at 8: 00.
 | Ok, Sir. How many are coming?
 | 4. By the way, What's your dress code?
 | We require a jacket and tie.
 | Let me ask some questions. Do you know what people need to get entry into China?
 | Yes. An passport and a visa are necessary for entry into China.
 | What materials do they need in order to apply the passport?
 | Do you think we should travel by bus or by train?
 | It's a difficult choice. The train is a litter faster, But much more expensive.
 | We could face delays if we travel by bus, Thanks to traffic jams.
 | Buses are more cramped and you can't walk around.
 | That's true, But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus.
 | Really? I think you see more traveling by train.
 | So, Which form of transport do you prefer to use?
 | I prefer going by train, Ever though it costs more.
 | Ok them. We'll go by train. I'm sure we'll have a good journey. Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets?
 | The train aren't usually full. We can get them on the day we travel. We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles.
 | From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position. What I want to know is why you think you're right for the job.
 | Well I'm impressed with what the company has done in the past and I think by hiring me the company's future can only be brighter. I find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation.
 | So you'Ve acquainted yourself with the company. It's refreshing to interview someone who's sure of what they want.
 | Yes, I believe that it's crucial for me to know if a company is right for me, Not just if I'm right for the company. I'Ve only been impressed by what I'Ve read and heard and I see myself having.
 | Commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here.
 | Can I ask for leave this afternoon?
 | What is the problem?
 | I had a headache this morning. I didn't pay attention to it. I thought probably it is because I didn't sleep well. But now it is getting worse and worse. I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive. Maybe it is the migrated.
 | It is ok. You look really pale and red eyes. I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest.
 | Did you see the woman that just left my office?
 | Yes.
 | She's another applicant, And a leading contender, But I didn't want to hire her. She's qualified, But she doesn't quite fit the profile. We're looking for an accountant, And part of the job requires interacting with clients. Well, Our clients want conservative people to handle their money. And green hair with ripped jeans doesn't exactly fill them with trust.
 | But it's the style now.
 | I realize that, But our business is serving clients and giving them what they want.
 | Of course.
 | Well, They don't want to deal with people who look like that. They want people who look more like yourself.
 | Why is that?
 | Well, They're older, And they don't understand today's fashions. When they see someone dressed like that, Warning bells go off. They don't like that style at all, And they don't like dealing with people who dress like that at work.
 | Oh, I see.
 | We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good, Very good. But, The clients reacted very negatively when they saw her. Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively.
 | What happened to her?
 | Well, She was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her, So her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her. She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends.
 | Excuse me? Do you have anything for a carsickness?
 | Yes, But you look fine.
 | Oh, It's for my brother. The little boy over there. He is getting a carsickness.
 | Poor boy! But don't worry. Here are two pills made in Germany. It's really effective. He will be just fine.
 | Thank you so much.
 | Take some with you next time, Just in case.
 | Sorry to interrupt, But my brother is still sleeping.
 | You mean the boy who felt carsick just now?
 | Yes. It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills.
 | Oh, Sorry, Maybe I gave you the wrong medicine.
 | What?
 | It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good. But don't worry. It has no undesirable side-effects.
 | Good evening. How many people of your party?
 | Three. Two adults and one kid.
