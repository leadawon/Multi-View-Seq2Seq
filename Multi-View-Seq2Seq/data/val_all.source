 | A: Hi Tom, are you busy tomorrow’s afternoon? | B: I’m pretty sure I am. What’s up? | A: Can you go with me to the animal shelter?. | B: What do you want to do? | A: I want to get a puppy for my son. | B: That will make him so happy. | A: Yeah, we’ve discussed it many times. I think he’s ready now. | B: That’s good. Raising a dog is a tough issue. Like having a baby ;-)  | A: I'll get him one of those little dogs. | B: One that won't grow up too big;-) | A: And eat too much;-)) | B: Do you know which one he would like? | A: Oh, yes, I took him there last Monday. He showed me one that he really liked. | B: I bet you had to drag him away. | A: He wanted to take it home right away ;-). | B: I wonder what he'll name it. | A: He said he’d name it after his dead hamster – Lemmy  - he's  a great Motorhead fan :-)))

 | Nancy: Howdy, how y'all doin'? | Tina: Is that a Texan drawl, girl? | Nancy: Yes ma'am! Loving it out here! | Tina: How's the job going? Kids behaving themselves? | Nancy: Mostly! They laugh at my accent though! | Tina: Well, they probably haven't met a Welsh person before! | Nancy: No shit! They ask me to repeat everything! Best one is "Water", course, it's mostly "Waarderr" here!  | Tina: LOL. I'd love to hear that, you picked up the accent yet? | Nancy: Nah, 21 years in Cardiff isn't easily removed!  | Tina: We're missing you here, the pub is quiet these days without your laugh! | Nancy: Miss you too!

I bet they had even more trouble being understood out there! See you after your trip!
