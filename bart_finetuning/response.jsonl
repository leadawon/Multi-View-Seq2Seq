Speaker 1: I guess you are right. But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.
Speaker 2: I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.
Speaker 2: Sounds great to me! If they are willing, We could ask them to go dancing with us. That is excellent exercise and fun, Too.
Speaker 1: Good. Let's go now.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah!
Speaker 2: It's easy. If you do exercise everyday, You can make it, Too.
Speaker 1: That's true, But then you have to buy a record player.
Speaker 1: Yeah, You're a pretty big guy. I play goalie, Myself.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah? Which team?
Speaker 1: The Rockets.
Speaker 2: Really? I think we play you guys next week. Well, I have to go to practice. See you later.
Speaker 1: All right, See you later.
Speaker 1: January 5th.
Speaker 2: Let's see... You're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, But you could see new, Exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting summers!
Speaker 1: That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, And my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.
Speaker 2: No, It's not, Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.
Speaker 1: Well, You certainly match those criteria, But they're so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?
Speaker 2: A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you!
Speaker 1: A girl he met on holiday in Spain, I think.
Speaker 2: Have they set a date for the wedding?
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses.
Speaker 2: And it's a bargaining. A house like this in river side costs double the price.
Speaker 1: Great, Is it a two bedroom house?
Speaker 2: No, It has three bedrooms and three beds, And has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. There's a two-car garage.
Speaker 1: That's a nice area too. It'll be a good investment for you.
Speaker 2: Yeas, When will you buy a house?
Speaker 1: Not untill the end of this year, You know, Just before my wedding.
Speaker 2: Right, Congratulations.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: Well, Last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, But if you listened to her, Then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her.
Speaker 1: No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen.
Speaker 2: It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids.
Speaker 1: My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, Then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, The schools we sent them too, And everything else under the sun.
Speaker 2: You said she used to? How did you stop her?
Speaker 1: We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing, And how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things. She understood, And now everything is a lot more peaceful.
Speaker 2: That sounds like a good idea. I'll have to try that.
Speaker 1: Good. After Stars. Com starts paying us, We won't need Vikam's cash anymore.
Speaker 2: And if we don't need them, We won't need Zina, Either.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful!
Speaker 2: And I love trying new recipes, Which I usually test with my friends. You can come, Too.
Speaker 1: Really? I hope I can have a chance to taste it. Don't forget to tell me.
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: You look like a cooking show host--only messier.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: I went sailing, Fishing, And horseback riding.
Speaker 1: I'm so jealous.
Speaker 2: The counselors were so nice too. It was the best summer ever. Except for all those mosquitoes!
Speaker 1: Walk?
Speaker 2: Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time.
Speaker 1: Oh no.
Speaker 2: Use the stairs, Never the elevator.
Speaker 1: Oh, Dear.
Speaker 2: And three times a week, You can either swim, Play racketball, Or hand ball.
Speaker 1: Oh no.
Speaker 2: Ok, You can stop now. It's time for the dance class.
Speaker 1: Dance class! I don't know how.
Speaker 2: You will.
Speaker 1: Oh...
Speaker 1: Well, It pays off for her. How old is she anyway?
Speaker 2: She will be 86 next month.
Speaker 1: That is truly amazing!
Speaker 1: Which days are these classes on?
Speaker 2: The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three.
Speaker 1: What about the other class?
Speaker 2: The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12.
Speaker 1: Are you sure there are no more open classes?
Speaker 2: I'm positive.
Speaker 1: Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll sign you up.
Speaker 1: Ok. Dad! I'm coming.
Speaker 1: True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.
Speaker 2: A crazy language? Why do you say that?
Speaker 1: One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.
Speaker 2: No wonder you say English is a crazy language.
Speaker 1: There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television.
Speaker 2: Thank you for you help.
Speaker 1: So Baltimore is winning?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is a really great place to watch a baseball game.
Speaker 2: Yeah, There isn't a bad seat in the place.
Speaker 1: The fans are great here, Too. Not like in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game.
Speaker 1: Yeah, It reminds you why they say baseball is America's favorite pastime.
Speaker 1: No, This is a focus-free camera. All you have to do is point and press the button.
Speaker 2: All right. Say cheese!
Speaker 1: I believe such things won't be realized, Just daydreaming.
Speaker 1: At school, In China. This is my first time to be out of my own country.
Speaker 2: It's amazing.
Speaker 1: What kind of music do you like?
Speaker 2: I like classical music. Do you?
Speaker 1: Not very much. Classical music sends me to sleep.
Speaker 2: I don't believe you.
Speaker 1: It's true.
Speaker 2: You are funny!
Speaker 1: So are you! How about another coffee?
Speaker 1: Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. I like playing basketball.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me why you like it?
Speaker 2: Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others.
Speaker 1: I just cann't believe my ears!
Speaker 1: There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television.
Speaker 2: Thank you for you help.
Speaker 1: Sounds nice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll probably just stay in and relax. Maybe watch a few movies.
Speaker 1: Can I stop by?
Speaker 2: Sure. Any time.
Speaker 1: I don't believe that.
Speaker 2: And in my opinion, Medicine is making us healthier.
Speaker 1: I agree with you in the sense. But we're all more miserable than ever, Aren't we?
Speaker 2: I don't agree with you. I maintain that we're healthier, Wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago.
Speaker 1: That's your opinion not mine.
Speaker 1: Is that all you would like to check out?
Speaker 2: That's all I need.
Speaker 1: Do you have your library card?
Speaker 2: Here it is.
Speaker 1: Make sure to take proper care of this video.
Speaker 2: That won't be a problem.
Speaker 1: If you damage the video, You will be fined.
Speaker 2: I won't damage it.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself.
Speaker 1: I... I... I miss my parents, Also they miss me.
Speaker 2: Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, And you didn't say anything about it.
Speaker 1: You mean I am groaned a few words?
Speaker 2: Totally not. Perhaps it's about our marriage.
Speaker 1: I agree, I had lunch there last week.
Speaker 2: Excellent! That sounds like a plan.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. Do you have a large extended family?
Speaker 2: I'Ve got 30 cousins on my mom's side and 10 cousins on my dad's side.
Speaker 1: Are you very close to your first-cousins?
Speaker 2: The ones that are my age are close relatives. Now that I'm older, I don't spend as much time with them as I used to, So I don't know my younger cousins as well as the older ones.
Speaker 1: I see. Who's the head of your household?
Speaker 2: It's definitely my mother. And, Her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. What does your grandfather think of your step-mother?
Speaker 2: At first, She was quite critical of her, But now that they'Ve been married for a few years, She's starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother.
Speaker 1: That's pretty much how you feel about your step-mother. Like grandmother, Like grandson.
Speaker 1: At the gate of the park.
Speaker 2: Great. I look forward to meeting you.
Speaker 1: See you then.
Speaker 2: See you.
Speaker 1: Could you move smoothly?
Speaker 2: Yes. My face even ached in the icy wind.
Speaker 1: What happened afterwards?
Speaker 2: I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop! You can just imagine how terrified I was.
Speaker 1: Poor girl!
Speaker 1: Well, I heard David has been fired.
Speaker 2: Oh, That is a shame. He is really hard working.
Speaker 1: I agree, But I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient.
Speaker 2: Cars might be convenient, But they're so bad for the environment.
Speaker 1: Do you have a car?
Speaker 2: No. I used to have one though. Once I started using my bicycle to get around, I found that I didn't really need it.
Speaker 1: Maybe if I sold my car now, I wouldn't be so tempted to use it.
Speaker 2: You could try. It would save you a lot of money.
Speaker 1: That's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, Insurance, And repairs.
Speaker 2: If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, You will get lots of exercise, Too!
Speaker 1: I could stand to lose a few pounds. Having a car has made me lazy. I never end up walking anywhere!
Speaker 2: Let's go to a car dealership. I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price.
Speaker 1: Sounds good! Let's go!
Speaker 1: Sounds hard.
Speaker 2: Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.
Speaker 1: Won't you get lonely?
Speaker 2: Hey, I am a pretty cool guy. I will make friends, And I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too. You know, Like fencing, Or theater or something.
Speaker 1: Good. So we don't have to work. How nice!
Speaker 2: But I don't think it's so nice.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain.
Speaker 1: I know, Our schedules are so weird. Sometimes, The little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that's open when we get home.
Speaker 2: Yeah, And the prices there are very high.
Speaker 1: I know. Three dollars for milk.
Speaker 1: You're right. He sure is.
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: That is a bank. The coffee shop is opposite the bank.
Speaker 1: Good. I will have hot chocolate.
Speaker 2: A stop! Wait for the lights to turn green.
Speaker 1: When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you.
Speaker 2: Sorry. How far is the museum?
Speaker 1: I am not sure. We will ask for directions in the coffee shop.
Speaker 2: Here we are. You find us a table and I'll get the drinks.
Speaker 1: Don't you think it's too bloody?
Speaker 2: On the contrary, Very exciting.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.
Speaker 2: I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, Find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, And that the place is hygienic.
Speaker 1: Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!
Speaker 1: Is there anything interesting?
Speaker 2: Yes, There are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education.
Speaker 1: I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV?
Speaker 2: Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs.
Speaker 1: That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well?
Speaker 2: Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals.
Speaker 1: I got it. Do you pay for the programs?
Speaker 2: Yes, 50 Yuan per month.
Speaker 1: It's awful, Isn't it?
Speaker 2: I can't bear to look at it. I'm rather disappointed.
Speaker 1: It can't be helped.
Speaker 1: That's really interesting.
Speaker 2: Sure. So what about you? Do you have any hobbies?
Speaker 1: Well, I like collecting matchbox! I'm not sure if that counts, Though.
Speaker 2: Of course it does. Everybody has his own hobby.
Speaker 1: Don't worry, You'll find a way.
Speaker 1: It's a very popular game in America.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?
Speaker 1: For me, It's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.
Speaker 2: Are you a football player?
Speaker 1: No, I just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We're too old to play tackle football.
Speaker 2: What is two hand touch and flag football?
Speaker 1: Instead of tackling somebody, You just have to touch them with two hands, Or if it is flag football, Grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing.
Speaker 2: I see. It's safer then right?
Speaker 1: Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, You're welcome to join us.
Speaker 2: I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together.
Speaker 1: Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, The latest type.
Speaker 2: You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea.
Speaker 1: No, There is an updated virgin, Three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, You can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes.
Speaker 2: I don't think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time.
Speaker 1: I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, So-called love at first sight.
Speaker 2: Anyway, I don't want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. There are many other options using the internet as dating methods. Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications. Of course, For these sites, You have to pay a membership fee. But all in all, It is more serious and professional. The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher.
Speaker 2: I don't want to post my personal information on the internet. I'm not knowing who is reading it.
Speaker 1: It starts at 8.
Speaker 2: Well, Who all is going to be there?
Speaker 1: Everyone from school.
Speaker 2: How do you know it's going to be so fun?
Speaker 1: This party is going to have a DJ, Food, And drinks.
Speaker 2: Wow, That does sound like it's going to be fun.
Speaker 1: So am I going to see you at the party?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I will be there.
Speaker 1: I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.
Speaker 2: I can see that you are trying, But where do you think you could improve?
Speaker 1: I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis.
Speaker 2: Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, Right?
Speaker 1: I'll try ; it's hard!
Speaker 2: Thanks for stopping by!
Speaker 1: There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick.
Speaker 2: And?
Speaker 1: So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.
Speaker 2: And it's a brick?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?
Speaker 1: I wanted to. But he said, No, The box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, Other people won't believe it's new.
Speaker 2: So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.
Speaker 1: Yes, It was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products. Look, It even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.
Speaker 2: But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?
Speaker 1: He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.
Speaker 2: Aha! Now I understand. You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk. So, What I think is, You deserve to get cheated!
Speaker 1: C'mon, Don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it. We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.
Speaker 2: That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.
Speaker 1: You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it. How could I fall for such a trick?
Speaker 1: It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?
Speaker 2: There's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, But when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends.
Speaker 1: Well, That's something I've never heard of. But if you ask me what I value most in a friend, I would say honesty.
Speaker 2: I agree. You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person. Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know. A friend in need is a friend indeed. I don't need fair-weather friends either.
Speaker 1: A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.
Speaker 2: It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.
Speaker 1: Turtles? Whatever... Look, All that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, That's what the math says.
Speaker 2: Math, Sheath. What's the evidence?
Speaker 1: There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, Thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, The Big Bang... DuH!
Speaker 2: Anyway, It's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that?
Speaker 1: Dude, Don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, Didn't you?
Speaker 1: Then the axiom - 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks' doesn't work any longer.
Speaker 2: You're right. Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts.
Speaker 1: Yes, I agree with you. When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active.
Speaker 2: Me too. To keep up with the changing world, One must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things.
Speaker 1: You know what? I've recently been teaching myself French.
Speaker 2: Really? That's great! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France.
Speaker 1: Yes, So I want to learn French to develop my career.
Speaker 1: Maybe. I'll have to ask my mother.
Speaker 1: Look, There are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, Or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before.
Speaker 2: I know, I know. I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?
Speaker 1: Fine! I want a divorce!
Speaker 1: I have no reason to distrust him. He's never caused any harm.
Speaker 2: Isn't there anything that sounds fishy?
Speaker 1: Nothing smells a rat. I told you that he's an all-right guy.
Speaker 2: All-right guy? All right. Let's talk about something else instead.
Speaker 1: I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.
Speaker 2: No, It will not be formal at all. It is a fun time. You will love the game show. Please dress casually. Usually there is an over abandon of drinks, So be careful with that.
Speaker 1: Don't worry, I can handle that. And I know if the boss is there, Even it is an informal evening, It does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him.
Speaker 1: Really? Are you going to introduce us?
Speaker 2: Well, He has already taken you know, That's his wife right there.
Speaker 1: And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?
Speaker 2: Forgive me darling. I'm very tired.
Speaker 1: And I bet you studied, Too.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I studied on Sunday evening. What about you?
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't clean the house and I didn't study. I stayed in bed and watched TV.
Speaker 2: That sounds like fun, But did you exercise?
Speaker 1: Sort of. I played golf on my computer!
Speaker 1: Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.
Speaker 2: Did she? That's great. However, If we have too many children, That will have a bad effect on the enviroment.
Speaker 1: How's your son these days?
Speaker 2: Oh, He's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays.
Speaker 1: He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child?
Speaker 2: I had mine when I was 24. That's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., Or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, But not just yet.
Speaker 2: Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country?
Speaker 1: Yes, There is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, Have fun, And explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, But they don't often succeed.
Speaker 2: Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.
Speaker 1: It's almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, Kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, They might go wild.
Speaker 1: Fantastic! I didn't want to come back.
Speaker 2: I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful.
Speaker 1: They are. And not only that the people are friendly, But also the food is delicious, Not to mention cheap.
Speaker 2: I do like Thai food. Did you see much of Bangkok?
Speaker 1: Not much. I've got enough city life in Beijing.
Speaker 2: I know what you mean. I could use a vacation myself.
Speaker 1: Hey, Wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime?
Speaker 2: Yeah, It sure would.
Speaker 1: 1808. The toilet doesn't work properly, The water doesn't run in the shower.
Speaker 2: I'm awfully sorry to hear that. I'll turn to it right away.
Speaker 1: Tell me! Tell me! What's your secret?!
Speaker 2: Ok, Ok. I'll whisper it to you, But you have to promise not to tell anyone!
Speaker 1: What?! You did that??!!!
Speaker 1: You know the phrase, The survival the fittest. We have no choices.
Speaker 2: That's right, I have to work hard.
Speaker 1: Yes I do. How about you?
Speaker 2: No, I'm a tourist. This place is amazing! It's much bigger than I imagined, And much more exciting! There's so much to see here.
Speaker 1: You can say that again! It's much more modern than people imagine. Where are you from?
Speaker 2: Um, Well let's see... I'm from Kansas originally. A much quieter and more peaceful place than here, That's for sure!
Speaker 1: Uh huh...
Speaker 1: Do people get married young?
Speaker 2: Not really. Very few people get married beforethe age of 20.
Speaker 1: Hmm. Do women usually work after they get married?
Speaker 2: No, A lot of women stay home and take care of their families. But some work.
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 1: Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.
Speaker 2: Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment.
Speaker 1: Yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country.
Speaker 1: You won't play online games full of violence, Will you?
Speaker 2: Once in a while.
Speaker 1: It's no good. And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time. You might as well do something healthy and meaningful.
Speaker 2: I hope I can practice self-control again.
Speaker 1: Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you?
Speaker 2: Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think.
Speaker 1: Did you do you own stunts in the movie?
Speaker 2: I wanted to, But my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, But I'll leave that to the experts in future.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for doing this interview.
Speaker 2: My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet?
Speaker 1: Yes. I have. I liked it very much. Like you, I was very impressed with Rachel's performance in the movie. She's going to be a star.
Speaker 1: Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter.
Speaker 2: Don't take too long. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather.
Speaker 1: I won't be long. No more than ten minutes. Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park?
Speaker 2: I Believe I will. Look for me near the lake.
Speaker 1: Just hold me... I'll always be here for you, No matter what. And together, We can tackle whatever life throws at us. I believe in us, Steven.
Speaker 2: I'm so happy to hear that! I knew we belong together. I love you so much.
Speaker 1: He said not to bother coming back. And I said, Fine, I won't.
Speaker 2: So what's the problem?
Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?
Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?
Speaker 2: He didn't say, But he said he would call me.
Speaker 1: Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!
Speaker 2: Oh, Steve. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call?
Speaker 1: Come on, Mary, You're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Steve. You're always so encouraging.
Speaker 1: That's what friends are for.
Speaker 1: Sounds quite fruitful, Why do you call it still a nightmare then?
Speaker 2: Well, The air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge. I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam. When I finally got home, I was totally exhausted. But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout.
Speaker 1: This is really a sad story. Did they trace back your luggage?
Speaker 2: I am still waiting for their call.
Speaker 1: Take it easy, All sufferings have their reward.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. Let's see if we can get more people in this plan. There isn't much business these days anyway, So I think many people will be interested.
Speaker 1: That's the style! You just wear boxers.
Speaker 2: What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug? What then?
Speaker 1: You're so old fashioned! Nobody is going to pull down your pants!
Speaker 2: If you ask me, It's a walking invitation!
Speaker 1: That's good. Do you live near here?
Speaker 2: No, We live in the suburbs. What about you?
Speaker 1: I live downtown, With my parents.
Speaker 2: Do you have a car?
Speaker 1: I don't need a car. I walk to work.
Speaker 2: You're lucky!
Speaker 1: That's good to know. Oh, Listen! The band's playing our song.
Speaker 2: I requested it. What do you say? Do you have your dancing shoes on?
Speaker 1: Always.
Speaker 1: I'll stand in with you if you like. I'Ve got nothing else to do.
Speaker 2: Oh, No. I couldn't possibly.
Speaker 1: Are your free this weekend?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have nothing to do.
Speaker 1: Great, Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend?
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: I'd like to call on you this weekend. I just want to a drop in for a chat.
Speaker 2: Really? Well, Ok, You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Is 5 PM. Saturday a good time for you?
Speaker 2: Hmm, How about seven? I can treat you to dinner.
Speaker 1: Sure, That would be great. I'll bring the wine.
Speaker 2: Ok. Then I'll be expecting you.
Speaker 1: I'll be there on time.
Speaker 1: How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one?
Speaker 2: At the beginning, It does not matter, But once someone gets one ball in, It is set.
Speaker 1: Can I get the black ball in?
Speaker 2: The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets.
Speaker 1: Let's go and try now!
Speaker 1: Then we'll have to put up with it.
Speaker 2: We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, They'll get drunk and fall asleep.
Speaker 1: That's without a doubt, The best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it!
Speaker 2: Run! They are thirsty for more!
Speaker 1: All right, I will explain it to you later on. Now scram.
Speaker 2: Ok. I will wait until you have had your fun, If that's what you want.
Speaker 1: That's exactly what I want, Thank you.
Speaker 1: I tell ya, When I got the invite, It really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.
Speaker 2: I know. But things have changed. I guess I've settled down.
Speaker 1: I guess so.
Speaker 1: What time is the right moment?
Speaker 2: Let the universe find us instead of forcing love. We prefer natural love. The most important thing is to be happy. Love will find us later. That is what we say.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark.
Speaker 2: It can't be that bad.
Speaker 1: I wish it wasn't, But there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here.
Speaker 2: Really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, Because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime.
Speaker 1: Do me a favor, And take a taxi. It'd make me feel a lot better.
Speaker 2: Ok, We will. How do you get around in the evenings?
Speaker 1: When I first moved in, I walked everywhere. But within a week, I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station! Now, I always take public transportation.
Speaker 2: Has anything else happened to you?
Speaker 1: Nothing else has happened to me, But I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close.
Speaker 2: Well, We'll be careful. Thanks for letting me know.
Speaker 1: I just cann't believe my ears!
Speaker 1: There is a wait right now to use the computers.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Would you please write your name on this list?
Speaker 2: Then what?
Speaker 1: I will call you when a computer is free.
Speaker 2: How do I log on to the computer?
Speaker 1: Use the number on the back of your library card.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I'll be sitting over there.
Speaker 1: Yes. You look very smart today.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah?
Speaker 2: Yes. Don't you think he should be pitied rather than accused?
Speaker 1: Oh yes. Men, Women, And children shake hands all the time.
Speaker 2: It's very simple. Men shake hands, Women and children don't.
Speaker 1: But some women do shake hands. And now a lot of children have such good manners, They shake hands too.
Speaker 2: Well, A good rule to follow is, For men you hold out your hand, For women and children, You wait and see what they do.
Speaker 1: That sounds easy enough.
Speaker 2: Sure. Once you get the hang of it, It's a piece of cake! It's nothing to worry about.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes, I know the one. How was the food?
Speaker 2: The food was excellent, But Jane ordered a birthday cake, Which they forgot about. So as you can see, You were not the only one.
Speaker 1: Oh, No.
Speaker 2: Yes, Jane was quite upset about it. The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert, But still...
Speaker 1: I would think this was the least they could do.
Speaker 2: In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while.
Speaker 1: Great. I have also been thinking of getting one. Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret? My birthday is not that far away.
Speaker 2: I can try, But knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately.
Speaker 1: I'm not. I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today. Why? Do you think I'm fat?
Speaker 2: No, Jess, Chill out!
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to this film. I read a good review of it in this morning's newspaper.
Speaker 2: Me, Too. It will be great to see something light and funny for a change. I'm tired of heavy drama.
Speaker 1: Are these seats okay?
Speaker 2: They're fine, But I can't watch a movie without popcorn.
Speaker 1: Do you have an online edition of that magazine?
Speaker 2: Yes, They do. But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription.
Speaker 1: Do you have a subscription?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month. Do you every buy magazines?
Speaker 1: I only buy them if they look particularly interesting. I don't buy any regularly.
Speaker 1: Barbara. But please, Just call me Barb.
Speaker 2: So Barb... What do you do?
Speaker 1: I'm studying medicine.
Speaker 2: Really? Where?
Speaker 1: At Harvard. What about you?
Speaker 2: I'm an engineer at IBM.
Speaker 1: Oh, Are you? That sounds interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I like it. Hey, It looks like the food is ready.
Speaker 1: Good. I'm starving.
Speaker 1: I've seen it so many times in books, But I never imagined I'd get to see it in person.
Speaker 2: There are tons of other paintings that I think are better.
Speaker 1: Maybe so, But do you have any idea how much this one is worth?
Speaker 2: No, How much is it worth?
Speaker 1: About 80 million dollars.
Speaker 2: Whoa.
Speaker 1: Cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar!
Speaker 2: Yeah, But I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, The manager would be pretty upset.
Speaker 1: That's true. I'm wondering did you learn anything from the job?
Speaker 2: Of course. There's always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world.
Speaker 1: You mean you got working experience, Right?
Speaker 2: Not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.
Speaker 1: It must be very demanding.
Speaker 2: Sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, It's easy to figure out.
Speaker 1: Really? It sounds interesting.
Speaker 2: Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I'll show you around.
Speaker 1: Great. I'm looking forward to it.
Speaker 1: At least more than 100 years old.
Speaker 2: Let's enter it!
Speaker 1: I can't open the door.
Speaker 2: It must be locked.
Speaker 1: Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.
Speaker 2: She can't answer you.
Speaker 1: She must be deaf.
Speaker 2: It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?
Speaker 1: Frightened? You must be joking.
Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more. That's an ideal place for a vacation.
Speaker 2: It sure is.
Speaker 1: I can't wait to go there myself.
Speaker 1: Check out your mom's closet. I'll bet she still has something.
Speaker 2: Good idea. Can I bring some music from that period too?
Speaker 1: That will be great! Do you have LPs or Cds?
Speaker 2: Don't tell me you have a record player!
Speaker 1: Yeah, You are right. I must stop complaining and stick to it every day.
Speaker 2: Yeah! Where there is a will, There is a way.
Speaker 1: Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.
Speaker 2: Well, Children usually resemble their parents.
Speaker 1: It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.
Speaker 2: You often like comparing children with their parents.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 2: You are doing the waltz wonderfully well.
Speaker 1: Thanks. I'm glad you say so. Oh, The music has stopped.
Speaker 1: It must be interesting to study English.
Speaker 2: Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good.
Speaker 1: Is English pronunciation easy or difficult?
Speaker 2: Sometimes it's difficult. Some words look different from the way one pronounces them.
Speaker 1: I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, But staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: I didn't do anything. Finally, He left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.
Speaker 2: Did he leave when you left?
Speaker 1: Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: He followed me all the way home!
Speaker 2: That's about five blocks. And around corners too. So he was definitely following you.
Speaker 1: Yes, He was. I'm not imagining it. Finally, Just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him. He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious. What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police?
Speaker 2: Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least. He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it. But if anything happens again, Then maybe you should call.
Speaker 1: Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!
Speaker 2: Of course you can call the police if you want. That's not what I mean. I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything.
Speaker 1: I suppose. What can they do? I don't even know who he is.
Speaker 2: Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much. Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out. If you see him a third time, And if he follows you again, Then I think we should go to the police. But for now, Just try not to worry.
Speaker 1: Alright. And I won't go to that cafe for awhile.
Speaker 1: Come on, HanMaimed, Don't make a fuss. A lot of Americans, Including many scientists, Believe in religion.
Speaker 2: But I'm really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, Are they?
Speaker 1: Yes, They are compatible. Actually, The U.S. Is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.
Speaker 2: I've heard about it a little bit before, But I don't understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist?
Speaker 1: That's a little complicated. You'll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U.S. History later on. Religion was and is a part of American people's life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, Which is a highly academic institution, Is in a sense the product of religion.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.
Speaker 2: Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?
Speaker 1: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.
Speaker 2: How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?
Speaker 1: That's because in the 16th and 17th century, There was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.
Speaker 2: So, You mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?
Speaker 1: Yes, That's why Puritans moved to the New World, Where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, It was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.
Speaker 2: Why did they want to found a college?
Speaker 1: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Actually Harvard was first named 'New College', Without a formal name.
Speaker 2: When did it begin to be called Harvard University?
Speaker 1: In 1639, It was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.
Speaker 2: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.
Speaker 1: Therefore, It's not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, There would note Harvard.
Speaker 2: Wow, I didn't know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history.
Speaker 1: Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U.S.
Speaker 2: I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.
Speaker 1: Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U.S. History and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.
Speaker 2: That's right. I have a lot to learn from you.
Speaker 1: You can ask me any question at any time.
Speaker 1: Ok, Sounds good. But I think it's your trick.
Speaker 1: Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.
Speaker 2: I think most people do. I like wearing nice, Colorful clothes in summer-you know, A nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter.
Speaker 1: Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze!
Speaker 2: Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year?
Speaker 1: Thanks to global warming, It could be hotter than ever!
Speaker 1: Oh, I forget. Sorry.
Speaker 2: I went to Harvard University.
Speaker 1: Did you? And what course did you take there?
Speaker 2: God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?
Speaker 1: I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.
Speaker 2: I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?
Speaker 1: Terrific! B. A., Again and again-B. A.
Speaker 1: Just about. There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone.
Speaker 2: How Ay days will the reunion be?
Speaker 1: Usually it's at least five days and four nights.
Speaker 2: This is going to be a major production for you!
Speaker 1: True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.
Speaker 2: A crazy language? Why do you say that?
Speaker 1: One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.
Speaker 2: No wonder you say English is a crazy language.
Speaker 1: Not really. I thought it was disappointing.
Speaker 2: It's a nice cinema, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Do you think so? I don't like it very much. I found it rather uncomfortable.
Speaker 1: A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.
Speaker 2: It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.
Speaker 1: Turtles? Whatever... Look, All that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, That's what the math says.
Speaker 2: Math, Sheath. What's the evidence?
Speaker 1: There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, Thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, The Big Bang... DuH!
Speaker 2: Anyway, It's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that?
Speaker 1: Dude, Don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, Didn't you?
Speaker 1: No, I'm not hungry.
Speaker 2: Well, Let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, But it's fun.
Speaker 1: Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like?
Speaker 2: Well, He's thin and tall. He has brown hair, A holt nose, Green eyes and wearing glasses.
Speaker 1: Mm. I've seen him a couple of times, I think.
Speaker 1: Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.
Speaker 2: I guess so, But I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, Especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.
Speaker 1: Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.
Speaker 2: I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.
Speaker 1: Well, There is that, Yes.
Speaker 1: I feel much better now.
Speaker 2: Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday?
Speaker 1: I'Ve already got it. Thanks.
Speaker 2: I will explain it in detail in the next class. Could you preview it?
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 1: Spring is a lively season.
Speaker 2: Yes. How about you?
Speaker 1: I admire plum blossoms very much. It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter.
Speaker 2: You have a perfect taste!
Speaker 1: It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow. I admire the bravery of plum blossoms.
Speaker 2: But it used to be ignored by many people.
Speaker 1: The bright people will remember it forever.
Speaker 2: Well, It's snowing. Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing.
Speaker 1: It seems 10 degree below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather, But do hate when it get slippery.
Speaker 2: The ice is soon be thick for skating. I'm so fine to want a sport.
Speaker 1: That's fine. Let's go skating together tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.
Speaker 2: Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.
Speaker 1: Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.
Speaker 2: I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power.
Speaker 1: You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, But dance might make you livelier and happier.
Speaker 1: That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.
Speaker 1: What kind of things would you like to see on the menu?
Speaker 2: Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least.
Speaker 1: That shouldn't be too difficult. Since this is a small neighborhood, Maybe they will take this suggestion.
Speaker 2: Let's try it!
Speaker 1: In fact, They're both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, Since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.
Speaker 2: Oh, Right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It's hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?
Speaker 1: It's still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.
Speaker 2: Oh! You mean she doesn't have to work now? It's hard for young parents not to overreact, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Very few, Unfortunately.
Speaker 2: How was your game today?
Speaker 1: Extremely good. I shot a 78, Including 5 birdies!
Speaker 2: Congratulations! What's your normal handicap?
Speaker 1: Ten. How did your game go?
Speaker 2: My drives were terrible today. I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps.
Speaker 1: Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again.
Speaker 1: Uh, I'd like to, But I have to work late.
Speaker 2: Oh, That's OK. Let's just meet at the theater before the show, Around 7:30.
Speaker 1: That sounds fine.
Speaker 1: Sorry to hear that. What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, She told me things just weren't working out and we weren't right together. But I thought things were just great. Why did she say this? It's completely out of the blue.
Speaker 1: Hey, That's not the girl with pink hair, Is it? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday.
Speaker 2: What? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy. Oh, No, I feel like such a loser.
Speaker 1: Hey, She is not worth it. Forget her.
Speaker 2: But she lied to me.
Speaker 1: Hey, She is not worth it. Anyway, There are plenty more fish in the sea. Listen, Let's go for a drink in the town. How about that?
Speaker 2: Ok, Then.
Speaker 1: But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face.
Speaker 2: What face?
Speaker 1: The one where you look like your dog just died. You have to get over her and the sooner the better.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know. You are right.
Speaker 1: Hey, Just watch out for cops or you're gonna end up in the slammer. You know you tend to go fast?
Speaker 2: Yes, I know it. I went through my last set of tires fast. I even had three flat tires in two weeks.
Speaker 1: Now watch... Some guys probably run a light and hit your car.
Speaker 2: Cut out, Would you?
Speaker 1: Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt?
Speaker 2: That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, But not all.
Speaker 1: Do you believe that Mormons have all of it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why do you really go to church?
Speaker 2: We gather together to encourage each other, Because we have common beliefs. We come together and call it church.
Speaker 1: There must have been some good news in the newspaper. I can't believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited.
Speaker 2: Well, There was one good piece of news. You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease?
Speaker 1: Yes. Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states.
Speaker 2: Well, They'Ve got the money and she's going tomorrow for treatment.
Speaker 1: I'm so happy for the family! They must be very relieved and excited about that.
Speaker 2: I'm sure they are. Oh, And a local man won the lottery. I'm so jealous! I wish it were me! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I'm amazed that I haven't even won a small prize yet. It's so unfair!
Speaker 1: Don't be moody! I hope you're not tired, Because we'Ve been invited to a party this evening. I know how excited you get about parties.
Speaker 1: What about the expression goodbye? Is that an idiom?
Speaker 2: That is just a natural, Grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.
Speaker 1: This is interesting, Ms. Parker.
Speaker 1: Where can I find it?
Speaker 2: Go to the western side of the campus, And you'll find it there.
Speaker 1: Is it full?
Speaker 2: When I went up there, It wasn't full at all.
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: Sometime this morning.
Speaker 1: Would it be full now?
Speaker 2: I am really not sure.
Speaker 1: Hackers are smart, And they want people to know about it.
Speaker 2: So they create viruses to tell people they are smart? That's really sick.
Speaker 1: That's too bad. How are things now?
Speaker 2: His life is hanging by a thread, And he is under an emergency treatment.
Speaker 1: What kind of volunteer work?
Speaker 2: I help out at the children's hospital. I help plan activities.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah?
Speaker 2: Yes, It's exciting. This month we are doing crossword puzzles.
Speaker 1: Really? And Chris? She was a very pretty little girl.
Speaker 2: Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris. She's married to a French photographer.
Speaker 1: Oh, How interesting. And what about Larry and Rocky?
Speaker 2: Larry drives a truck. He drives all over the country. We hardly ever seen him.
Speaker 1: Really? Where does he live now?
Speaker 2: Colorado.
Speaker 1: And does Rocky drive a truck, Too?
Speaker 2: Oh, No. Rocky is a pilot.
Speaker 1: Really? Where does he fly? Does he fly to other countries?
Speaker 2: Yes. Mostly to England and France.
Speaker 1: You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people.
Speaker 2: Honey, It's not so serious. It's just an animal.
Speaker 1: Just an animal? But it has life too. If you want a tattoo, Get one. It's your choice because you want it. But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one?
Speaker 2: Ok, I understand, But what else could we do?
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. How old is she?
Speaker 2: She's ten.
Speaker 1: I suppose they're playing games.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Ellie was playing games all day yesterday. By the way, Alice, When's your birthday?
Speaker 1: Today.
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, Imagine that! How old are you?
Speaker 1: Eighteen. Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight. Do you want to come?
Speaker 2: Very much. What time?
Speaker 1: About 6:00.
Speaker 2: I'll be at your house at about 5:30. Happy birthday.
Speaker 1: And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress.
Speaker 2: And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, And he lifts weights every day.
Speaker 1: The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president. He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation. Products are selling like hotcakes.
Speaker 2: I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution, And partly because of our new marketing strategy. Because of the new advertising campaign, We have become the top sellers in the field.
Speaker 1: Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts. I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good.
Speaker 2: Let's hope it is!
Speaker 1: Am I? Um... My face gets red when I walk too fast.
Speaker 2: You're embarrassed, Aren't you? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy. The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her...
Speaker 1: I have confidence in them.
Speaker 1: We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers, And I'm making potato salad.
Speaker 2: I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Congratulations! Susan. I'm so happy for you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Really going to miss you.
Speaker 1: Me too. I'll write to you once I get settled. But I have so much to do. You might have to wait a while. But I really will write to you. I love to write letters. I think it's more meaning than the emails even than the phone call.
Speaker 2: Ok. Take care. Have a nice journey.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Look after yourself. Bye.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, But we can find out. I bought some crosswords to keep him busy.
Speaker 2: Great, Then let's go visit him. I want to give him some flowers, Too, To say sorry.
Speaker 1: Ha, Yes, Brilliant!
Speaker 1: Yeah, Especially since she got a promotion recently.
Speaker 2: I don't know. Maybe it's some kind of personal problem.
Speaker 1: Thank you, They're beautiful. You can hang your coat over there. Try this new couch, It is so comfortable. You will love it. Want something to drink, Tea, Coffee, Juice or Cola?
Speaker 2: Don't bother. I will help myself.
Speaker 1: Make yourself at home.
Speaker 2: It is such a nice place.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments. Look, They are making photos now of my designed kitchen.
Speaker 1: Oh, What a pity!
Speaker 2: I just don't want to play table tennis any more.
Speaker 1: Is it that bad? It's nothing more than a game.
Speaker 2: My opponent bowled me with the very first ball. I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis.
Speaker 1: Oh, Come on! Failure is the mother of success. Don't lose heart. I'm sure you'll succeed.
Speaker 2: Perhaps you are right. But I still need some time to recover from the failure.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.
Speaker 2: You're dancing so well.
Speaker 1: You dance beautifully too.
Speaker 2: When did you learn to dance?
Speaker 1: In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz.
Speaker 1: How about tango?
Speaker 2: Oh, I like it. It's such a beautiful dance, But I can't do it well. What about you?
Speaker 1: Tango is my favorite. Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot. ( the music has stopped ).
Speaker 2: Thank you for the dance.
Speaker 1: My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: I think you're right. There needs to be an international response to this problem?
Speaker 1: Then my son drove into a tree.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 1: The dog bit the delivery boy.
Speaker 2: What a pity!
Speaker 1: And a storm blew our roof away.
Speaker 2: Ho, No!
Speaker 1: Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.
Speaker 2: Well, Children usually resemble their parents.
Speaker 1: It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.
Speaker 2: You often like comparing children with their parents.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 1: Well, I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon.
Speaker 2: When are getting married?
Speaker 1: Some time next year. We haven't set the date yet.
Speaker 2: Congratulations! I had no idea.
Speaker 1: Thank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time?
Speaker 2: Do you like amusement parks?
Speaker 1: For the most part, Yes. Some of the rides are bit too scary for me, Though.
Speaker 2: If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can, You'll have a good time.
Speaker 1: Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark?
Speaker 2: Even those. It'll be very romantic, I think. You'll have loads of fun.
Speaker 1: Thanks for the advice. I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight.
Speaker 2: I'm sure he'll love the idea. Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it!
Speaker 1: About 40 percent, If he speaks slowly. When he speaks fast, I can only catch a word here and there. But Mr. Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher. With his help, My Chinese is getting better and better e.
Speaker 1: You should be. You worked really hard last night preparing for it.
Speaker 2: Thanks for helping me with it. If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best, I wouldn't have ever been able to pass.
Speaker 1: You don't have to thank me. It's just a part of my job as your counsellor.
Speaker 2: Did you always do well at school?
Speaker 1: No, In fact, I was terrible at taking exams.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Sure, But my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot. When are your final exams?
Speaker 2: I'll get my finals in two months.
Speaker 1: When do you plan on studying for those exams?
Speaker 2: Most students just cram the night forehead.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's a good idea?
Speaker 2: No, I think I should study a little bit at a time, Starting a few weeks before the exam.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a good idea. What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying?
Speaker 2: I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant.
Speaker 1: It sounds like you've learned something useful this year!
Speaker 1: That sounds fair. That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us.
Speaker 2: Not as fun though. A live band is way more exciting!
Speaker 1: Our class doesn't have enough money. We already checked into it.
Speaker 2: Let me know with your next dance. I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity.
Speaker 1: The water there looks so dirty.
Speaker 2: I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica.
Speaker 1: I like the pier too, Because it's beautiful at night.
Speaker 2: Is Malibu beach nice?
Speaker 1: It's a lot nicer, And I really like it better.
Speaker 2: So you want to go to Malibu?
Speaker 1: If that's okay with you.
Speaker 2: Sure, Let's go to Malibu.
Speaker 1: In other parts of the world, Especially in Africa, There is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow enough food.
Speaker 2: It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains. Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment.
Speaker 2: I think I'd like to do that. I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies.
Speaker 1: When did you change your mind?
Speaker 2: After I tried French food. Before that, I used to cook really boring things for my family.
Speaker 1: I still can't believe it! So, Did you go to cooking school or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I went to California to study.
Speaker 1: Really? How long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: I was there between 88 and 90.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: Then I came back here. I worked for about three years to get some experience.
Speaker 1: Well, We have always dreamed of owning our own home, But real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive.
Speaker 2: I understand. That's why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town, Far from the city.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea if you can find employment nearby.
Speaker 2: I agree. That's why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine, Or Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Have you checked the computer?
Speaker 2: I have already.
Speaker 1: What did it say?
Speaker 2: It says the book is on the shelf, But I didn't find it there.
Speaker 1: I can always borrow the book from another library.
Speaker 2: You can do that?
Speaker 1: I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in.
Speaker 2: That's fantastic. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen, Pinto andDatsun, And twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth.
Speaker 2: How about mileage and gas?
Speaker 1: There is no charge for mileage. And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll try a Pinto. I want to rent a car for one week.
Speaker 1: All right, Sir. May I have your driver's license?
Speaker 2: Here you are.
Speaker 1: No, I'm not hungry.
Speaker 2: Well, Let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, But it's fun.
Speaker 1: Do you eat any special food for the festival?
Speaker 2: Yes,Dumpling is a must. There is also other food. For example, People eat chicken for good luck.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful, Isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, It's really wonderful!
Speaker 1: Oh, Great! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll have a good time.
Speaker 1: Yes, For the most part. It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments, Anyway.
Speaker 2: How about your tongue? Does it still hurt?
Speaker 1: No, The burn ointment seemed to take effect right away. I think it's already healed.
Speaker 2: How did you get that burn again?
Speaker 1: I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago.
Speaker 2: You haven't had much luck lately, Have you?
Speaker 1: No, But I'm sure I'll get better soon.
Speaker 2: When's the last time you took your tablets?
Speaker 1: I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch.
Speaker 2: I think it's time you took another does of each. What would you like to drink with them?
Speaker 1: Just some water, Please. Do you have any ointment for my nose? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much.
Speaker 2: Sure, I'll just go and get it now. What would you like to eat? Some soup?
Speaker 1: That sounds good.
Speaker 2: Soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick. I hope it makes you feel better, Too.
Speaker 1: Thanks for reminding me. She's the right person to help me.
Speaker 1: All these memories of prom night came back to me. I had to be alone. You remember that night?
Speaker 2: I remember someone spiked my punch. You sat with me in the girl's bathroom...
Speaker 1: A good suggestion for you. You need a holiday.
Speaker 2: It wasn't always like this, You know.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean. We always do the same thing. There's no variety in our lives.
Speaker 1: You need a holiday. That's what's the matter.
Speaker 2: Certainly, Perhaps.
Speaker 1: My pleasure Miss. Actually, Could you recommend what to eat here? I've never been here before.
Speaker 2: Sure. Well, The avocado sandwich is delicious, And it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also, The milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town!
Speaker 1: Well, Thanks for the suggestions.
Speaker 2: Oh, Don't mention it.
Speaker 1: So, Can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present?
Speaker 2: Sure, A promise is a promise.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up. He'll understand you.
Speaker 1: He's outgoing and honest, But sometimes he's a bit conservative.
Speaker 1: No, They're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in...
Speaker 2: Hawaii? My dream honeymoon destination?
Speaker 1: You got it! We'll fly there directly from Texas.
Speaker 2: Oh, Jack! That's wonderful!
Speaker 1: I don't like such a family.
Speaker 2: What kind of family are you like?
Speaker 1: I like a family composed of many people. It includes grandparents, Parents, Aunts and uncles, And children.
Speaker 2: It's a traditional family. It may be too large to live well.
Speaker 1: We can live well, I think.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes. And we're proud of you, Loans.
Speaker 2: It's nice of you to say so.
Speaker 1: I think I ‘d say norway. It has many picturesque fjords, Waterfalls, And mountains.
Speaker 2: Isn't it really cold there?
Speaker 1: Well, The north of Norway is almost always cold, But further south it can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, So there's snow almost everywhere in winter.
Speaker 2: I'Ve been to other Scandinavian countries, But not to Norway. Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there.
Speaker 1: That sounds ridiculous. Why?
Speaker 2: Well, I am gaining weight these days, And I have to watch my calories.
Speaker 1: Wow, A remote car model and my favorite brand. I really like it. That is so nice of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car. It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself.
Speaker 1: Typical you, Always wanting to keep the best things for yourself. The more I appreciate the gift now.
Speaker 1: Right. The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents.
Speaker 1: No way! They want publicity for themselves, So that they get invited to make more films, Go to lots of cocktail parties, And even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party.
Speaker 2: Show biz stars have plenty of expenses. That's why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, Seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and at-shirt, But they can't because their managers force them to wear clothes they don't like.
Speaker 1: I don't understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They're overpaid, Over-ambitious, And over-adored.
Speaker 2: I think you should give them some credit. They're very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves.
Speaker 1: Come on! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves。.
Speaker 1: I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, How can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?
Speaker 2: You'Ve got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?
Speaker 1: Look, We have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, It's probably not a good idea to keep it up I'm willing to forgive and forget and if you are.
Speaker 2: Fine. Let's call a truce. I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll try to do the same. So, I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night?
Speaker 1: Autumn is also very nice in Washington.
Speaker 2: Is it very cold in winter there?
Speaker 1: No, It isn't. But sometimes it snows a lot in winter.
Speaker 2: Does it rain a lot in summer there?
Speaker 1: Oh yes! Sometimes it rains very heavily. How about here in Beijing?
Speaker 2: There's a lot of rain in summer, But it seldom rains in autumn.
Speaker 1: I feel it's rather dry here.
Speaker 2: That's true. Many people from the south don't like the weather here.
Speaker 1: Are you from the south?
Speaker 2: No, I'm from the north. I was born in Beijing, Actually.
Speaker 1: I see. So this is your hometown?
Speaker 1: Cool! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer, Free sketch or claborate-style painting?
Speaker 2: I prefer free sketch, Especially the landscape paintings. I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings.
Speaker 1: That's true. Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature, Which is an important part of China's traditional culture.
Speaker 2: I love this art exhibition!
Speaker 1: So do I. Let's go to other areas to see what they have got, Shall we?
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: Do you know what the temperature is today?
Speaker 2: I missed today's weather forecast over the TV.
Speaker 1: It feels like ten degrees below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery.
Speaker 2: The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I am so fond of winter sports.
Speaker 1: That's great. Let's go skating together tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I'm sure and I remembered your phone number. I'll call you.
Speaker 2: Ok, They begin to register.
Speaker 1: It's time I left.
Speaker 2: Have a nice journey! Do give my regards to your parents.
Speaker 1: Mine aren't fixed. Sometimes I do the day shift, Sometimes the night shift.
Speaker 1: Would you mind telling me how old you are?
Speaker 2: I'm twenty-seven.
Speaker 1: And could you tell me what other jobs you have had?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have worked in a bank for the last years.
Speaker 1: And what was your salary at the bank?
Speaker 2: I got $ 500 a week.
Speaker 1: Sounds cool! But that is not what a lady should do. People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk.
Speaker 1: I'm a bus driver.
Speaker 2: Oh, Do you enjoy it?
Speaker 1: No, I don't really like it. It's boring.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: Now let's have one together.
Speaker 1: Do you know how to set the timer?
Speaker 2: Let me see... Set the timer first and push the button, Oh, Come here.
Speaker 1: Ok, Let's have a try.
Speaker 2: Cheese...
Speaker 1: Did it come out?
Speaker 2: Yes, But it's blurred and a little dark.
Speaker 1: Never mind. Let's go to the falls and try again.
Speaker 2: Ok, Let's go.
Speaker 1: What a pity. It was quite exciting. Both teams played very well.
Speaker 2: How did it finish?
Speaker 1: It finished in a draw. What was the film like?
Speaker 2: It was quite good. But. I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first.
Speaker 1: Did your wife enjoy it?
Speaker 2: No, She didn't. After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book.
Speaker 2: Of course, I am sure.
Speaker 1: You shall go easy on her. She is new here.
Speaker 2: Just how am I supposed to do that?
Speaker 1: You shall just take it in surprise.
Speaker 2: I've tried, But she keeps pushing my buttons.
Speaker 1: Try to pull it together, Vernassa. I am sure things will turn note, Ok?
Speaker 2: I am not. She is no picnic.
Speaker 1: Well. If you think I can help, Let me know.
Speaker 2: Thanks, Serena.
Speaker 1: We have a guy who plays guitar, And another who plays bass. Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm a singer.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house.
Speaker 2: Great! Wait here? You don't have enough room for the amplifiers, Microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice?
Speaker 1: What airline and what flight?
Speaker 2: Pan American Airlines. Flight 282.
Speaker 1: I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P.M.
Speaker 2: Ok. See you tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I didn't say that either. I was hoping we could discuss the matter together. I want your advice but I don't want you to tell me what to do. I'Ve got to make decisions for myself, Dad.
Speaker 1: What time?
Speaker 2: Eight o'clock tonight, Would you please set us in a private room?
Speaker 1: So sorry, We're fully booked in that room. Would you like to make reservation some other time?
Speaker 2: Maybe not, Thank you all the same then.
Speaker 1: Fair enough. Keep up the good work.
Speaker 1: Mother Nature is quite an artist.
Speaker 2: Look behind us at the mountains! They're reflecting pink!
Speaker 1: Amazing. The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere!
Speaker 2: Where is our camera? Let's see if we can catch this on film!
Speaker 1: You know you didn't.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm telling you now.
Speaker 1: Yes, But you might have told me before.
Speaker 2: I didn't think you'd be interested.
Speaker 1: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?
Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.
Speaker 1: Oh, You men! You're all the same.
Speaker 1: Bummer, I'm sorry to hear that, Is he better now?
Speaker 2: Yes, Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP.
Speaker 1: Tell him I was asking about him.
Speaker 2: I will.
Speaker 1: Do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think they're provided by the school for that special day.
Speaker 1: No. Those you have to provide for yourself.
Speaker 2: What do most of the students do?
Speaker 1: Well, Most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service, But some of the education majors have had them made, Because they will be faculty members, And they'll need them f.
Speaker 2: Then, I might as well have them made.
Speaker 1: Mary, Don't move. Stand right there. It's a good shot. The background is very pretty.
Speaker 2: Hold it a second. I want to fix my hairpin.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter. Say'cheese '.
Speaker 2: Here's Lisa. May I take a picture with her?
Speaker 1: Certainly. Ok, Got you.
Speaker 1: It's a good idea to have a radio, Isn't it?
Speaker 2: Sure. It's like understanding on the telephone — — you can't see the speaker! It's great for improving listening comprehension.
Speaker 1: It takes a long time to learn a language, Doesn't it?
Speaker 2: It certainly does. But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress.
Speaker 1: I am heading for the library. I've got a research project to do. How about you?
Speaker 2: I'm going to the English class. It'll start in five minutes, I've got to run.
Speaker 1: See you later, Alligator.
Speaker 2: After a while, Crocodile.
Speaker 1: I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.
Speaker 2: Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, My country is more agricultural and has much less industry.
Speaker 1: We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, But cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced.
Speaker 2: The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.
Speaker 1: I think you're right. There needs to be an international response to this problem.
Speaker 1: It might work. I'll have to hear it. Show me what you'Ve done.
Speaker 2: It was horrible! I played play it much better at home!
Speaker 1: It's just nerves. Just play the right hand for now. One two three four five six, Ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, Good. Don't forget the accidentals! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b.
Speaker 2: Is that better?
Speaker 1: Yes, Much better. Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal. What was that?
Speaker 2: Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.
Speaker 1: That's ok, Keep going, You're moving ahead by leaps and bounds. Watch your dynamics! Keep your elbows lifted. Remember to stroke the keys, Don't pound. That's better! Remember that as a pianist or any.
Speaker 1: Come on. Dating is a part of young people's social life. Besides, You're sixteen already.
Speaker 2: I'm glad that you see it that way.
Speaker 1: Do you want to borrow my coat? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, Lisa!
Speaker 1: I didn't hear anything about a delay. I thought everything was running on time. What happened?
Speaker 2: We boarded the plane on time, But then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem.
Speaker 1: Then what? Your plane was three hours late!
Speaker 2: We finally took off, But about 30 minutes later, The captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight.
Speaker 1: Turbulence is pretty normal, Isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, But this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life! Everyone started getting sick. The flight attendants had to stay in their seats. The captain decided to land early.
Speaker 1: So where did you land?
Speaker 2: We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a nightmare!
Speaker 2: It wasn't too bad. At lease I'm alive.
Speaker 1: Have you had anything to eat?
Speaker 2: I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant. How about you?
Speaker 1: I had a few coffees while I was waiting. Let's get out of here!
Speaker 1: No, Thank you.
Speaker 2: That's the most important thing.
Speaker 1: It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid.
Speaker 2: Forget about it.
Speaker 1: When you lent me the bike, It looked brand new, Almost anyway.
Speaker 2: Maybe, But really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.
Speaker 1: I appreciate that, Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yes. Would you like to come here later to have a coffee? Bring all your family.
Speaker 2: We'd like to. Can you tell me when we go?
Speaker 1: About 4.
Speaker 2: Ok. Do you want us to bring something?
Speaker 1: No, Just come here.
Speaker 2: Ok, See you later.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good.
Speaker 2: You said it.
Speaker 1: Why not? What this article says makes good sense to me. If you read it, I'm sure you'll agree with me.
Speaker 2: I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old. But perhaps you can keep the article for a while, I may read it later.
Speaker 1: Thanks. Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion.
Speaker 2: I still like the olive one best. There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you.
Speaker 1: The question is, Can he have it done before Friday?
Speaker 2: These guys are professional. I think they can have it done tomorrow. Let's ask.
Speaker 2: Not particularly. I like a girl to be good.
Speaker 1: I will! I could use some good luck!
Speaker 1: In my book, All a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up.
Speaker 2: Enough! If we don't finish the game, There won't be time for any movies tonight!
Speaker 1: We'll meet again in a few days.
Speaker 1: Where did you transfer from?
Speaker 2: I was at PCC before.
Speaker 1: Why did you transfer?
Speaker 2: I was going to go here first, But my grades weren't good enough.
Speaker 1: Did you like it at PCC?
Speaker 2: PCC is an incredible school.
Speaker 1: Well, I wish you luck here.
Speaker 2: I'm sure I'll like it here.
Speaker 2: Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach, Do you?
Speaker 1: That's right. You're going away next week.
Speaker 2: I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account. There was a problem last week.
Speaker 1: I have to pay my credit bill too. If I don't pay it soon, The credit card company will charge me interest.
Speaker 2: Their interest rates are usually quite high. It's a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest.
Speaker 1: Well, I hate the noise in the city, But I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don't go together.
Speaker 2: I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, But I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities.
Speaker 1: People can't have it both ways. If you live in the country, It is often less convenient. If you live in a city, It is noisy, But there's more to do.
Speaker 2: I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They're so much better to look at than concrete, Rows of parked cars and tall buildings.
Speaker 1: I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, You get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.
Speaker 2: The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There's so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.
Speaker 1: Just remember that in that village there's nothing to do. There's not even a pub or restaurant. There's just one small shop with a poor selection of goods.
Speaker 2: You're right. I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends. I would hate living in the country!
Speaker 1: That sucks. He must feel depressed.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days.
Speaker 1: Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him.
Speaker 2: That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else.
Speaker 1: Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done.
Speaker 2: Sounds good.
Speaker 1: That's very good. It's said that marriage is the Ab of love. But the words may not be right.
Speaker 2: The situation differs in person.
Speaker 1: What?! Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights! If you are putting in so many hours, They should give you some kind of compensation.
Speaker 2: They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers, But frankly, It's not much of an incentive. They give us a bonus of ten dollars.
Speaker 1: That's just wrong! Why don't you just quit?
Speaker 2: I would, But I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job. I don't have very many job marketable skills, There aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for.
Speaker 1: It sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now!
Speaker 1: My surname is Gao.
Speaker 2: How do you spell it, Sir?
Speaker 1: Come on, Baby. It's time now.
Speaker 2: Mam, Another minute, Could I?
Speaker 1: Hurry up, Little boy.
Speaker 1: Why? It's unfair. You can learn a lot from it.
Speaker 2: She says a part-time job is cursed blessing. It takes so much time and energy that I won't be able to focus on my studys.
Speaker 1: That may be true. But I'm sure you're able to find a balance between them. Why not try it?
Speaker 2: I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake. But I'm a senior now, I don't want to miss the chance this time.
Speaker 1: I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind.
Speaker 2: I'll try, But what if she insists?
Speaker 1: Just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding. And more importantly, You can manage both your study and the job.
Speaker 2: Do you think it will work?
Speaker 1: Sure. Every cloud has its silver lining. Just try.
Speaker 2: Ok, I'll do that. Thank you, Iris.
Speaker 1: Sure. Good luck, Maria!
Speaker 1: I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.
Speaker 2: What is very difficult to gather team player together.
Speaker 1: I usually play with my school-mates.
Speaker 2: Do you like watching football matches?
Speaker 1: Yes. I went toTinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday.
Speaker 1: And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress.
Speaker 2: And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, And he lifts weights every day.
Speaker 1: I see. What's it like there?
Speaker 2: Well, The life style is much more relaxed than here in the city. And the seafood is tastier!
Speaker 1: Well, Have a great time!
Speaker 1: Hey, Daniel, What's your favorite weather? Snowy or sunny?
Speaker 2: Me? Er, I like hot weather, Just like today.
Speaker 1: What? Are you crazy?
Speaker 2: I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out.
Speaker 1: Ew, Danny, Gross!
Speaker 2: By the way, What's your favorite weather?
Speaker 1: I love snowy, Because it is very very romantic.
Speaker 2: Look, Is that Tom?
Speaker 1: Well, What's your excuse then?
Speaker 2: My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes?
Speaker 2: It's true, Sir.
Speaker 1: Of course not. You know, There are many foreign customers like you here. And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English.
Speaker 2: Oh, Are you an English student? Or you just study English for interest's sake?
Speaker 1: No, I'm not an English student. But I do like English. I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language. So I try to improve my English.
Speaker 2: Very nice. Thank you for your time.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Sir. But I'm not allowed to accept any tips.
Speaker 2: Ok then. I don't want to put you in trouble.
Speaker 1: Well, Would you like something else? The new-made cafe parfait is really good. Want some?
Speaker 2: Ok. But I'd like some cookies.
Speaker 1: Sure. If you want more coffee, Please go over there. There is self-help coffee maker.
Speaker 2: I surely know that. Don't forget that I am a regular customer here.
Speaker 1: Oops. Well, Wait for a while. We'll get it done quickly.
Speaker 2: It's OK. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Good idea. Thanks a billion.
Speaker 1: Oh, I forget. Sorry.
Speaker 2: I went to Harvard University.
Speaker 1: Did you? And what course did you take there?
Speaker 2: God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?
Speaker 1: I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.
Speaker 2: I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?
Speaker 1: Terrific! B. A., Again and again-B. A.
Speaker 1: How come?
Speaker 2: It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected.
Speaker 1: Oh. It's awful, But it can't be helped.
Speaker 2: I'll just have to put up with it.
Speaker 1: Would you like to have lunch with me?
Speaker 2: Yes. When?
Speaker 1: Is 11:30 AM OK?
Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't hear you. Can you say that again please?
Speaker 1: I said, 11:30 AM.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm busy then. Can we meet a little later?
Speaker 1: Ok, How about 12:30 PM?
Speaker 2: Ok. Where?
Speaker 1: How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant?
Speaker 2: Oh, Where is that?
Speaker 1: It's on 7th Street.
Speaker 2: Ok, I'll meet you there.
Speaker 1: Now, The effort pays off. You have accomplished something.
Speaker 2: Come on, Don't flatter me anymore. I took the job because I love being challenged. But I can't get this turned around without the support from you people.
Speaker 1: See you on Moday. Have a great weekend.
Speaker 2: You too. Thanks for dropping in.
Speaker 1: That's stupid.
Speaker 1: What do you think of the ending?
Speaker 2: The ending is a bit weak. It's so abrupt, Like those of most other detective stories.
Speaker 1: That's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth?
Speaker 2: Yes, But I don't really use it often. Have you ever used it?
Speaker 1: No, But I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go.
Speaker 2: Yes, I guess I should try to use it.
Speaker 1: Yes, If that's all right for you.
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure I'll be all right. In fact, I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you. What time are you planning to start?
Speaker 1: Oh, Good. If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock, That would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner.
Speaker 2: That sounds fine. I'll be there around seven.
Speaker 1: Oh! That's much hetter than I did.
Speaker 2: Can you tell me how to improve myself?
Speaker 1: There's no secret at all. The only thing for you to do is to practice more. You will succeed.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your encouragement.
Speaker 1: It's a pleasure. Come on. I'm on your side.
Speaker 1: Thank you, I will. Hope to see you again next year.
Speaker 1: Why? You make me confused.
Speaker 2: He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines, Read the political sections and return them later.
Speaker 1: Why does he have such a privilege?
Speaker 2: He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him.
Speaker 1: I see. Does he live by himself?
Speaker 2: Yes, He has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle.
Speaker 1: He must be lonely?
Speaker 2: I bet. But he is always busy telling the children stories.
Speaker 1: How respectable!
Speaker 1: You're going to have to wait for a computer.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: Please put your name on this list.
Speaker 2: Then what do I need to do?
Speaker 1: When there is a computer available, I will call you.
Speaker 2: What do I do to log on to the computer?
Speaker 1: Just type in the number on the back of your library card.
Speaker 2: Okay. Thanks for your help.
Speaker 1: Mrs. White.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding. You know her father passed away several years ago.
Speaker 1: Maybe her uncle will.
Speaker 2: I think so. The wedding will be held at her church, Right?
Speaker 1: Right. Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding.
Speaker 2: Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon?
Speaker 1: Yes, Jane says they will go to China.
Speaker 1: Oh, So it was my fault, Was it? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse.
Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do to help you?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to, So that I can relieve my stress.
Speaker 1: Anytime after six will be fine.
Speaker 2: All right, It's a date.
Speaker 1: Dark blue.
Speaker 1: Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.
Speaker 2: Did she? That's great. However, If we have too many children, That will have a bad effect on the enviroment.
Speaker 1: How's your son these days?
Speaker 2: Oh, He's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays.
Speaker 1: He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you think it is a good age to have a child?
Speaker 2: I had mine when I was 24. That's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., Or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, But not just yet.
Speaker 2: Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country?
Speaker 1: Yes, There is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, Have fun, And explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, But they don't often succeed.
Speaker 2: Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.
Speaker 1: It's almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, Kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, They might go wild.
Speaker 1: Did you register yet?
Speaker 2: Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss.
Speaker 1: What classes do you think are still open?
Speaker 2: Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, So there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology.
Speaker 1: That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.
Speaker 2: I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, So if you go to his office, You can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.
Speaker 1: He does that?
Speaker 2: I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class.
Speaker 1: That makes sense. I think I'll do that. Thanks for all the help.
Speaker 2: No problem, Man.
Speaker 1: And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition. I want to get the burden off my family.
Speaker 2: You always worry too much about everything. Take it easy, Honey. You are good enough. You can go to the ideal college.
Speaker 1: Ok, Ok. I'm so sorry. By the way, For you, Is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work?
Speaker 2: In a perfect world, I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much, And make lots of money!
Speaker 1: Ok, Honey, Stop dreaming. You should face the reality.
Speaker 2: That's only a joke. To be honest, I have to improve my English, Because my English is not good enough. I still get confused about some simple grammars. Since you are quite good at it, Do you have any suggestions?
Speaker 1: En, First you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class. Second, I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center.
Speaker 2: Is the training center helpful?
Speaker 1: I think so. Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation.
Speaker 1: Yes, We have a big tree this year. I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday. Do you want to come and see it?
Speaker 2: I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother.
Speaker 1: When can you come?
Speaker 2: I don't know when I can come. I'll let you know later.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought of just cutting down? You could do it gradually.
Speaker 2: Yes, Maybe I should have another try.
Speaker 1: A lot of young people have to do that.
Speaker 2: Yes. But the husband had to work overtime three times a week, So he was always tired.
Speaker 1: Lt sounds like the story of my life.
Speaker 2: Yes, It does, Doesn't it? But this man was always over-tired, And he couldn't sleep. So he used to take two sleeping pill every night.
Speaker 1: I take sleeping pills sometimes.
Speaker 2: Yes, But not two every night. Anyway, The strain was too much for him. He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital.
Speaker 1: It sounds a very depressing film.
Speaker 2: Not really. His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter, Because she could speak French and German fluently. After a few months 'work, She had a better job than her husband. So in the end,
Speaker 1: I don't know. My wife used to speak French. I must tell her to brush it up.
Speaker 1: It's a fifteen-minute intermission.
Speaker 2: The seats are excellent. We're right in the center.
Speaker 1: It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great.
Speaker 2: I can't agree more.
Speaker 1: Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert?
Speaker 2: In the United States, Yes. But back in China, I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents.
Speaker 1: Do you have large concert halls in your city?
Speaker 2: We have two. One is like this one. The other is a little smaller.
Speaker 1: That's great. Well, We'd better get back to our seats. It's about to start.
Speaker 1: No, Not every day.
Speaker 2: Will the library be open on Saturday?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: What are your hours on Saturday?
Speaker 1: Saturday's hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night.
Speaker 2: All right. Thank you.
Speaker 1: What else can I help you with?
Speaker 2: That's it. Thank you.
Speaker 1: It isn't Elvin.
Speaker 2: Dave then? Dave is a spy for WebTracker? You can't be serious.
Speaker 1: Loan me that tape recorder you have. And don't say anything to anyone until I come back.
Speaker 1: Pretty good, Thanks. I'm going to see my uncle.
Speaker 2: Good bye then, And keep in touch.
Speaker 1: Good bye.
Speaker 1: We should come here more often.
Speaker 2: You are absolutely right.
Speaker 1: I'd like to come back next weekend.
Speaker 2: That's exactly the way I feel.
Speaker 1: What about your beautiful bathing suit? We shopped all day. Don't you want to show it off?
Speaker 2: Everybody who walks past me sees it. Besides, It's a good sunbathing suit.
Speaker 1: All right. Suit yourself. I am going swimming.
Speaker 2: Jim!
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair? I am really tired of lying in thousand.
Speaker 1: I've got a better idea. Why don't we hire a boat and go for a ride? What do you think?
Speaker 2: Are you serious? That will be wonderful!
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That is the library. And it has more than 1, 000, 000 books.
Speaker 1: What's the building to the south of the library?
Speaker 2: You know, Our school is divided into two parts, The junior high school and the senior high school. That is the new classroom building for our senior high school.
Speaker 1: Is there a swimming pool in your school?
Speaker 2: Yes. There is a large swimming pool, But it is only available in summer.
Speaker 1: I do envy you. And I hope I can enter your school one day.
Speaker 2: I believe that you can make your dream come true.
Speaker 1: Aha, But how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get... Get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things... Best programmes that... That undoubtedly are on television?
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose one of the problems is... Will depend on what a person's life style is, And that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television, He will then, You know, Hmm. Be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things.
Speaker 1: Do you think though that... That in... In a sense television skilled people's own er... Sort of, Creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that is a danger, And I think that.. In fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their... Their main... Um field of amusement and... Because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be, You know, Particularly interested in talking to them, You Know the television will be the main thing in the room.
Speaker 1: Yes, I've got that part covered.
Speaker 2: When, Exactly do you need to leave?
Speaker 1: I don't need to leave until the very end of class.
Speaker 2: Fine, But next time try and not have to miss class again.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Professor. See you later!
Speaker 2: See you later! Drive carefully.
Speaker 1: I want to try something exciting.
Speaker 2: It's an easy way to get hurt, Let me tell you.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you all about it next Monday.
Speaker 2: Well, Take care of yourself, And don't say I didn't warn you.
Speaker 1: I'm from Shanghai. And you?
Speaker 2: I'm from Chicago.
Speaker 1: I was in a comfortable place, So really, It's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long?
Speaker 2: Yes. When I came out of the subway, It was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up.
Speaker 1: I totally understand.
Speaker 1: We have decided to go to the park this Sunday. Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet?
Speaker 2: What did the whetherman say?
Speaker 1: He's predicting clear skies.
Speaker 2: Well, I will think it over.
Speaker 1: Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.
Speaker 2: I know, But the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field.
Speaker 1: Well, If you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.
Speaker 2: Oh, Thanks, Professor Donald. This is really very nice of you.
Speaker 1: Alright... I get your point.
Speaker 1: I'm happy to hear that, But publishing is more than just talking to writers. It involves a lot of work, Patience and responsibility. Most of the work is boring.
Speaker 2: I don't feel bored at all. I'm getting along with my colleagues. I will enjoy working with them. People are great in this industry.
Speaker 1: Do you have any complaints?
Speaker 2: No, I have no complaints. I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company. Is that true?
Speaker 1: Yes, You have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well.
Speaker 2: That's perfect. I will definitely do well.
Speaker 1: Mr. Smith often talked about you.
Speaker 2: Really? I am glad to meet you.
Speaker 1: I'm honored to know you.
Speaker 1: May I turn on the radio then?
Speaker 2: Turn on the radio? What for?
Speaker 1: So that we can sit down together and listen to some music.
Speaker 2: Listen to some music? And who'll cook dinner? Will you?
Speaker 1: Ok, I will. But let's go to a disco after dinner.
Speaker 2: To a disco? Oh, No. You know I hate pop.
Speaker 1: I don't think she would do such a thing.
Speaker 2: But she did and it made me disappointed.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up! A girlfriend is not everything.
Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.
Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.
Speaker 2: Oh, I just can't forget it.
Speaker 1: We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon.
Speaker 2: Ok. Let's go.
Speaker 1: Thanks for the invitation. I will!
Speaker 1: Oh, What kind of music do you listen to?
Speaker 2: Classic. Something that could calm your mind.
Speaker 1: I think that might work for me as well.
Speaker 2: Working out is another good way to relieve anger.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Jogging, Yoga, Or even just taking a walk.
Speaker 1: We're just worried about you, Taylor.
Speaker 2: Whatever. I wish people would just leave me alone!
Speaker 1: As the city grew, It must have absorbed many village nearby.
Speaker 2: Yes, It did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city.
Speaker 1: I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive. Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs. There was a castle near one village, So our city has a castle too.
Speaker 1: Really? So your city does have some old history after all.
Speaker 1: Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often?
Speaker 2: When I talk to Chinese, I always want to speak Chinese.
Speaker 1: You should always keep in mind, The more you practice, The better English you can speak.
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to do that.
Speaker 2: I don't understand.
Speaker 1: It's our policy.
Speaker 2: What can I check out?
Speaker 1: Only books or videos.
Speaker 2: I need this magazine.
Speaker 1: You will have to read it here.
Speaker 2: That's weird.
Speaker 1: Why can't we?
Speaker 2: It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, Then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, And I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon.
Speaker 2: But we can't have thirteen for dinner!
Speaker 1: I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's only a superstition. It really doesn't mean anything.
Speaker 2: Absolutely not! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!
Speaker 1: Ok, Ok. I'll ask my sister to come. That way we'll have fourteen for dinner.
Speaker 2: That's better.
Speaker 1: Hold on for a moment please. I'm fetching my textbook.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: Oh, The homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense.
Speaker 2: Explain the economic law? An essay question again?
Speaker 1: Yes. You can use your textbook for your reference.
Speaker 2: Are there any clear answers in the book to this question?
Speaker 1: I don't think so, Maria, But I think you can look for information on the Internet.
Speaker 2: Ok, Thank you, Shirley. You are very helpful. I have another question. When does the Economic Law of China come into effect?
Speaker 1: Oh, There isn't such a code called economic law. The Economic Law of China is a general concept for several laws.
Speaker 2: There isn't such a code?
Speaker 1: Yes, It's a general name for several laws related to economics, Like Commercial Law, And Law of Central Bank.
Speaker 2: Got it. Thank you, Shirley.
Speaker 1: Thank you, I will. Hope to see you again next year.
Speaker 1: Oh, Tell me about it. Anything interesting?
Speaker 2: Hmm... Oh, This one, 'The Drunken Beauty'. This is a real classic.
Speaker 1: ' The Drunken Beauty '? It's funny that we have' Sleeping Beauty 'in my country. Anyway, What's it about? Is the beauty a drunkard?
Speaker 2: Of course not. She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen. They play was famous for its singing and dancing.
Speaker 1: Sure, People do that when they are drunk. What about the actress?
Speaker 2: She is an opera star in China. Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang.
Speaker 1: Oh, I've heard about him before. He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking.
Speaker 2: You are such an expert on it. I don't know that.
Speaker 1: You know, Interest is the best teacher.
Speaker 2: So, Want me to book the tickets again?
Speaker 1: Please do that. I can't wait to come back again. The performance must be really amazing.
Speaker 2: We can do that if you like. Maybe next weekend.
Speaker 1: That will be great.
Speaker 1: Well, Whatever it does, I feel transformed!
Speaker 1: What does it say?
Speaker 2: I didn't get accepted.
Speaker 1: You can't be serious!
Speaker 2: I'm serious.
Speaker 1: Are you all right?
Speaker 2: NyU was my first choice.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry that you didn't get in.
Speaker 2: I'll just have to wait for UCLA.
Speaker 1: Sounds hard.
Speaker 2: Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.
Speaker 1: Won't you get lonely?
Speaker 2: Hey, I am a pretty cool guy. I will make friends, And I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too. You know, Like fencing, Or theater or something.
Speaker 1: We really have some miserable weather sometime. I wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round.
Speaker 2: If it was sunning all year round there would be drought. You probably would not like it either.
Speaker 1: I guess you are right. Maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable.
Speaker 2: The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like. Our weather is so changeable.
Speaker 1: Very nice.
Speaker 2: Yes, It is. But I'Ve got a lot of work too.
Speaker 1: Well, That's life, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Did you have a good journey?
Speaker 2: Yes, I enjoyed it very much.
Speaker 1: Where have you been on this trip?
Speaker 2: Let me see. Ah, Yes, I've been to England, France, Germany, Italy and now I've been in Spain.
Speaker 1: Really? How long will your holiday last?
Speaker 2: Two weeks.
Speaker 1: All these countries in two weeks?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I will. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Really? What happened?
Speaker 2: It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, And we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, Said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip. I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all.
Speaker 1: That's pretty harsh.
Speaker 2: I know, But I was so upset. I mean, Come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says?
Speaker 1: You know she probably feels just as bad.
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often.
Speaker 1: Well, In that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll call later to patch things up.
Speaker 1: No. You are just burning yourself out these days. Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again.
Speaker 2: One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year. He filled the school column with his name, And his score was relinquished.
Speaker 1: How could he make such a silly mistake?
Speaker 2: He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years, And couldn't get used to it immediately. He was extremely nervous then.
Speaker 1: He lost a very good chance to go to college, Didn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah. The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam. Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam. And there are fewer subjects.
Speaker 1: That's a very good lesson. We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, We can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.
Speaker 1: What else can we do to protect the environment?
Speaker 2: If you do have to drive, You should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, Your home should use sources of renewable energy.
Speaker 1: How about recycling? Does that actually help?
Speaker 2: Yes. You should take your glass, Paper, Plastic, Cardboard, And tin cans to a recycling center.
Speaker 1: What do you think the biggest worry for our future is?
Speaker 2: I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone.
Speaker 1: I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before!
Speaker 2: To be honest, In order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place, We're all going to have to become more interested in the environment.
Speaker 1: I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party. Would you like to come?
Speaker 2: I'd love to. But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now. See you later.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: Hey, That's enough about my hair.
Speaker 2: I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too.
Speaker 1: I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute.
Speaker 2: Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too?
Speaker 1: Oh, Good. That's nice to hear. Well, I am going to a football match. I need to go.
Speaker 2: Say hi to your family for me.
Speaker 1: Thanks, I will, Byebye!
Speaker 1: It's Lin. It's spelled L-I-N.
Speaker 2: R-I-N?
Speaker 1: My pronunciation is not very good. It's L-I-N, Lin.
Speaker 2: I got it. Mary Lin.
Speaker 1: Lin is a common Chinese last name.
Speaker 1: You're not nervous?
Speaker 2: Of course I'm nervous.
Speaker 1: What are you most nervous about?
Speaker 2: I won't know anybody at that school.
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be nervous about that.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Meeting new people is a good thing.
Speaker 2: That's a good way to think about it.
Speaker 1: Hug! And this sweater from my aunt? Isn't it hideous?
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: Are you even listening? I'm trying to have a conversation with you.
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to watch the game, But you're yapping on about your new clothes!
Speaker 1: Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon!
Speaker 2: Well could you do me the favor of making this quick? It's the third quarter and you'Ve been blabbering on since the first!
Speaker 1: Oh, Your precious game. You watch the same game every year, And each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals!
Speaker 2: Oh no you didn't. You didn't just insult theSals-bury Seals, Did you? Why don't you just. Just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?
Speaker 1: I might just! Enjoy your stupid game!
Speaker 2: And Merry Christmas!
Speaker 1: Merry Christmas!
Speaker 1: You can say that.
Speaker 2: But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them?
Speaker 1: They must have mixed hackers with crackers.
Speaker 2: What is crackers then?
Speaker 1: There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, But they aren't. They break into computers and break the phone system. Real hackers call these people crackers, And want nothing to do with them.
Speaker 2: So they are two totally different concepts.
Speaker 1: Well, The real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, Irresponsible and not very bright, And feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, Many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers. This irritates real hackers to no end.
Speaker 2: I see. Then the basic different is, Hackers build things, Crackers break them.
Speaker 1: You got it.
Speaker 2: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: You are welcome.
Speaker 1: Yes, I probably could.
Speaker 2: You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups?
Speaker 1: Next class meeting.
Speaker 2: That will be soon enough, But make sure you get next week's assignment in as well, All right?
Speaker 1: That would work for me.
Speaker 2: Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student.
Speaker 1: In the future, That could be possible.
Speaker 2: In this article, Scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person, There's no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original!
Speaker 1: Really? What else have you discovered?
Speaker 2: I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines. For example, An animal be immune to disease that affects human. So, Scientists find out why it's immune.
Speaker 1: That's great, Because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves. I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones.
Speaker 1: I'm so humiliated! What's that man saying? Everyone's laughing!
Speaker 2: He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies.
Speaker 1: Well. John had promised to be my date, But he stood me up. I waited for a full hour in the cold wind.
Speaker 2: So how long did you stay?
Speaker 1: I left after the opening dance. I couldn't wait to get out of there.
Speaker 1: There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality. Is it going to be some future project that never happens?
Speaker 2: I believe it's certainly for real. It without question has suffered a lot of delays. But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December. It is a reality. It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission. It seemed to fizzle out. Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner?
Speaker 2: I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair, That it doesre-ignite people's interest to push on. But only time will tell.
Speaker 1: You had gone to the moon twice, Orbited space around the Earth lots of times, And of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have. How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness? I just can't wait.
Speaker 2: If I were the man making the decisions, You could get in line tomorrow. I strongly support ordinary people going into space. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be in the near future.
Speaker 1: I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.
Speaker 2: But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together.
Speaker 1: I usually play with my schoolmates.
Speaker 2: Do you like watching football matches?
Speaker 1: Yes, I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday.
Speaker 2: Oh, I watched it on television. It was an exciting match.
Speaker 1: And don't ever forget it.
Speaker 1: What kind of scholarship is it?
Speaker 2: It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association. I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American.
Speaker 1: Fine. I know about that scholarship. You have to be a student in your junior year, And you have to have a grade point average of 3. 7 or higher.
Speaker 2: I'm a junior now, And my GPA is 3. 92.
Speaker 1: Excellent. So you'll have a good chance of getting it.
Speaker 2: Well, I hope so. The competition is probably pretty heavy. And they want a writing sample too.
Speaker 1: Do you have an essay you want to send them?
Speaker 2: No, They want a special essay. I must write an essay on a particular question they pose.
Speaker 1: What is the question?
Speaker 2: They give applicants a topic. The topic is, The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society. My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty short essay.
Speaker 2: Yes, But I need to write it by next week.
Speaker 1: Good luck. I'm sure you will do a good job.
Speaker 2: I came here today to talk to you because... Well, I need to ask two favors.
Speaker 1: Sure. What are they?
Speaker 2: First, I need a letter of recommendation.
Speaker 1: I'd be happy to write one for you.
Speaker 2: And second... Well, I'm not sure if it's normal.
Speaker 1: What is it? Do you want me to read your essay?
Speaker 2: Yes, If you could. I mean, If you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes. Or maybe you'd have some suggestions.
Speaker 1: Of course I could read it. That's no problem. But you need to get it to me soon.
Speaker 2: I will. I want to write the first draft tonight. So I could bring it tomorrow morning.
Speaker 1: Alright. If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning, I can talk with you after class on Friday. So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend.
Speaker 2: That would really help me a lot. I'm very grateful.
Speaker 1: Don't mention it. I'm always willing to help good students.
Speaker 1: Don't you have a garage?
Speaker 2: Not in the new apartment. We have to leave the car in the parking lot.
Speaker 1: How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then? You must have to keep it well below zero.
Speaker 2: I do. Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero.
Speaker 1: Does it ever get that cold on here?
Speaker 2: Not really. It sometimes gets to 20 below.
Speaker 1: Speaking of cold, How about going for a cup of coffee to warm up.
Speaker 1: You are absolutely right. They are too brief. They don't tell you anything.
Speaker 1: I'm going to London on business next week. But I know nothing about it.
Speaker 2: I get it. You want to find a guide, Don't you?
Speaker 1: Yes, Steven. You always know what I want.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. I will call Hanson, And ask him to help you.
Speaker 1: Thank you!
Speaker 1: A piece of cake. You'll be successful.
Speaker 1: Oh, Did you know Hugh Young? He was a music student.
Speaker 2: Hugh Young? Didn't he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time?
Speaker 1: Yes. And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university.
Speaker 2: I remember Hugh. Most people thought he was a little... Uh... Peculiar. Do you know what he's doing now?
Speaker 1: Yes, He's a millionaire in Houston now.
Speaker 2: A millionaire? As a jazz musician?
Speaker 1: Oh, No. He's an executive for a large computer company. I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday. They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers.
Speaker 2: Well! I guess people don't find him so peculiar anymore.
Speaker 1: By the way, Would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening? Tomorrow is my birthday.
Speaker 2: Good, Happy birthday to you!
Speaker 1: Not so soon. It's not my birthday today. Well, You'll come, Won't you?
Speaker 2: Sure, I will. Thank you for inviting me.
Speaker 1: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: Pretty good. There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad. The worst thing was the guy behind me. He snored all through the night!
Speaker 2: Really? But you were in first class! Nobody woke that guy up?
Speaker 1: The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason.
Speaker 2: That's terrible! So you didn't get any sleep?
Speaker 1: Not much... But that's ok... I'm a night owl anyway.
Speaker 2: So, Aside from visiting our factory and offices, Are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China?
Speaker 1: I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall.
Speaker 2: That's not a problem. We can have a company car take you there. It's only about a two hour drive.
Speaker 1: Have you ever worked?
Speaker 2: No, But I can learn. What are you going to do this summer?
Speaker 1: I'm going to camp. I've gone to camp for four summers.
Speaker 2: I've never gone to camp. What do you do there?
Speaker 1: We do many things. In the morning, We go swimming and boating. In the afternoon, We play basketball or tennis. We sit around a camp fire at night. We sing or tell stories.
Speaker 2: That sounds wonderful.
Speaker 1: It is wonderful. What's John going to do this summer?
Speaker 2: I think he's going to the mountains with his parents.
Speaker 1: Well, So long, Mary. Have fun.
Speaker 2: You too, Peter. Give my regards to John. I'll see you in September.
Speaker 1: Hard to say. Now the score is in our favor.
Speaker 2: Yes. Our guest team is really tough.
Speaker 1: They're still fighting hard. Let's wait and see.
Speaker 1: It's not worth it. Besides, I have to save up to pay for some bills.
Speaker 2: Bummer. I guess we're both out of luck.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well, I'll see you this weekend.
Speaker 1: Let's find out what time it starts.
Speaker 2: Let's look at the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Here it is. It starts at 8 o'clock.
Speaker 2: Wonderful. I'm so excited.
Speaker 1: I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up.
Speaker 1: Absolutely. To be frank, I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas. I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days.
Speaker 2: Maybe you should let me know about your plan. I want to take my kids there some day. Too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh my god! It's still there. We have our first date right on there.
Speaker 2: Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight.
Speaker 1: You were dull at that time.
Speaker 2: But you agreed to go out with me at last.
Speaker 1: I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married.
Speaker 1: What do you plan on doing after you retire?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think I will do something new. I'Ve always wanted to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: I admire your energy, Ruth. You are young at heart.
Speaker 1: Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock?
Speaker 2: Please wait for us even if we're a little late.
Speaker 1: Never mind. I'll be waiting for you.
Speaker 2: See you then.
Speaker 1: Ok. Bye!
Speaker 1: I... Er... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks.
Speaker 2: Lend you a few bucks? No way! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time?
Speaker 1: Yeah. But I...
Speaker 1: Do you like this place?
Speaker 2: I don't think it's very nice. And my father doesn't like it. But my mother likes it very much. So we often come here.
Speaker 1: How often?
Speaker 2: Well, We come here almost every month.
Speaker 1: Who's that?
Speaker 2: It's my mother. She's fond of swimming. And the man beside her is my father.
Speaker 1: Do you like swimming?
Speaker 2: No, I hate swimming. I prefer playing tennis.
Speaker 1: What's the average income?
Speaker 2: That's the really hard to say. I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month, If you convert the money from our currency into dollars.
Speaker 1: So your country is fairly rich.
Speaker 2: I think we are richer than most countries, But not as rich as countries in western Europe. Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment, Which is roughly 8 %. It has doubled over the last four years.
Speaker 1: Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that.
Speaker 1: Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food.
Speaker 2: I'm glad. We have only about twenty things here, And I'm in a hurry to get home.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: It kept me awake.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: It kept me awake a couple of hours.
Speaker 1: I'm so sorry, I .. I didn't realize it was that loud.
Speaker 2: It was that loud, And it was pretty late, And check with Mary if you don't believe me.
Speaker 1: It's true. It was a bit loud.
Speaker 2: I'm very sorry. I didn't realize it. I promise I'll keep it down in the future.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's no problem. It's OK. You know, It only happened once.
Speaker 2: I am glad we've straightened everything out.
Speaker 1: That sounds so interesting. I wish I learned a hobby.
Speaker 2: Hobbies are never too late to learn. They offer a variety of classes at the local community college. You should look into it.
Speaker 1: I think I will. Thanks for the info.
Speaker 1: You're so lucky. I hope to get married to a guy like that.
Speaker 2: I'm so happy. Even though we are both working, We get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Do you guys do anything special?
Speaker 2: In the evening, We just sit and talk over dinner. But on the weekend, We try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant, Or go to a nice cafe.
Speaker 1: Sound like everything is great.
Speaker 1: I don't think she would do such a thing.
Speaker 2: But she did and it made me disappointed.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up! A girlfriend is not everything.
Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.
Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.
Speaker 2: Oh, I just can't forget it.
Speaker 1: Life is like a box of chocolates, You never know what you're gonna get.
Speaker 2: That's my favorite.
Speaker 1: You know, It also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995. Unbelievable!
Speaker 2: It deserves. That film can give us a lot of inspiration.
Speaker 1: Yes, The Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble.
Speaker 2: All in all, It will never lose its appeal.
Speaker 1: Gucci, I have an idea. Do you want to see this movie together?
Speaker 2: Sure. Now you are talking.
Speaker 1: Okay, Pollyanna, What's so good about this weather?
Speaker 2: Well, For one, We have an excuse to stay home.
Speaker 1: We 'get' to stay home? Do you know something that I don't?
Speaker 2: I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us.
Speaker 1: No, It's a Monday.
Speaker 2: So you are leaving two weeks from now?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 1: We're going to the bookshop. Would you like to join us?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would. I need to buy a textbook for my course and, As you know, I love browsing through the latest paperbacks.
Speaker 1: Me too. I need something to read on the flight to new york. I can never sleep on planes. Sarah wants to pick up some children's books for her daughter.
Speaker 2: I want to look at nelson Mandela's autobiography.
Speaker 1: This is sure to be a worthwhile read.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, But what's it used for?
Speaker 2: A lot of things!
Speaker 1: Tell me in details.
Speaker 2: Okay. BBS, An online service, Offers a wide variety of online games, Files, One-on-one chat, Message areas, Private mail, And participate forums.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's great. I want to try later.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, But they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, The manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me.
Speaker 2: That's strange. But probably, It is the new interview technique they call it 'Getting to know you more personally'. What about your answers?
Speaker 1: Just did my best.
Speaker 1: You're going to need to pay for the damage.
Speaker 2: How much are you talking?
Speaker 1: It's going to be $ 5.
Speaker 2: That's not bad at all.
Speaker 1: It really isn't.
Speaker 2: Here you go.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome. Have a nice day.
Speaker 1: I will think about it.
Speaker 1: In the case, Maybe facial charm should be his leading card. After all, The majority of his fans are girls.
Speaker 2: Yes, His face looks are manly, With a straight nose and infinite eyes. As a man of medium height in the West, He keeps a powerful but elegant figure, Looking neither lanky nor stout.
Speaker 1: And he is English! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent.
Speaker 1: Shall I say around ten o'clock?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00.
Speaker 1: You know our boss always trying to save the last penny. We have to use up the equipment first.
Speaker 1: I watched the race with my children. We saw you run to the finish line. We all screamed with excitement.
Speaker 2: It was really an exciting moment.
Speaker 1: Sure. I'm learning Chinese through songs.
Speaker 2: So you're learning Chinese songs?
Speaker 1: You can say that. I can actually sing some of them now.
Speaker 2: That's a real achievement. How did you do that?
Speaker 1: I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer.
Speaker 2: It makes sense.
Speaker 1: It does. I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way. They are clearly presented and easy to follow.
Speaker 2: Can Join you, Katherine? I do want to have a try.
Speaker 1: Why not? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day. We can learn it together now.
Speaker 2: Great. Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary?
Speaker 1: Yes, Just in case we run into me new characters.
Speaker 2: Ok. I will bring it with me.
Speaker 1: Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, If you don't mind me saying so.
Speaker 2: It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, Visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.
Speaker 1: Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, How old are you?
Speaker 2: Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!
Speaker 2: Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, And what about yourself?
Speaker 1: I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S of A, Although I have some Colombian heritage.
Speaker 2: Really? That's great! Do you speak some Spanish?
Speaker 1: Uh... Yeah .. of course!
Speaker 2: Que bien! Sentences poems habeas en espanol!
Speaker 1: Well, Sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community. You'd have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day, But you would definitely save money doing it that way.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Do you know anyone who has done that before?
Speaker 1: Sure, My sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way. They're pretty satisfied with it.
Speaker 2: Is the house pretty run-down.
Speaker 1: Not at all. The woman, Who owned it, Took good care of it. But when she died, She had no family left and no will, So the government had to sell it for her.
Speaker 2: Was it a very old house?
Speaker 1: It was about 75 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing, But it didn't take a lot of money or time.
Speaker 2: Is it in a good location?
Speaker 1: The area can be a bit rough in the evenings, But the neighbors watch out for each other, So it's ok.
Speaker 1: Does Jim need to make more money?
Speaker 2: Afraid so. The more the better.
Speaker 1: What do they need all that money for?
Speaker 2: Well, They spend it pretty quick. New clothes, New computers and new cars every year. And they'Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress, She likes to spend a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Do they have any children?
Speaker 2: No. They want children but no luck yet.
Speaker 1: What does Jim like to do?
Speaker 2: Jim likes to travel around the world. That's expensive! So he tries to make a lot of money.
Speaker 1: What does Mona like to do?
Speaker 2: Oh, She enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses, And she has quite a bit of jewelry.
Speaker 1: Wow... She sounds like a high maintenance wife.
Speaker 2: I guess so. She is also interested in politics. She knows everyone in city government.
Speaker 1: Politics can be an expensive hobby.
Speaker 2: She is pretty serious about it. Her uncle is a mayor. She wants to follow in his footsteps.
Speaker 1: Politics is a hard game to play.
Speaker 2: She might do well. Everyone seems to like her.
Speaker 1: In that case, You should go home and get plenty of rest.
Speaker 2: What if this small fever turns into a big fever?
Speaker 1: Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you.
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you learn?
Speaker 2: She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do.
Speaker 1: Anything? Do you really believe that we can do anything?
Speaker 2: If you really want to do something and you work hard at it, I believe you can do it.
Speaker 1: You said she was strict. Did she have a lot of rules?
Speaker 2: She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable. For example, The students had to treat each other with respect, Or they would be disciplined.
Speaker 1: I see. She sounds like she really cared about her students.
Speaker 2: Yes. She treated us all fairly. She don't have any teacher's pets.
Speaker 1: Really? Doesn't every teacher have a teacher's pet?
Speaker 2: Well. To be honest, I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades. However, Miss Baymler didn't treat me any differently. She really didn't have any teacher's pets.
Speaker 1: Do you know what she is doing now?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I do. After she taught our class, She got married and moved to another city. Then, She started writing children's book.
Speaker 1: Have you ever read one of the books?
Speaker 2: Of course! Both children and adults enjoy her books.
Speaker 1: Why don't you recommend one to me?
Speaker 2: Ok! I'll bring one to you next time.
Speaker 1: Of course, Tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game.
Speaker 2: Who plays who?
Speaker 1: Rockets vs Lakers. Yao Ming, My idol, Will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience.
Speaker 2: It's amazing. And when did he begin to play in the NBA?
Speaker 1: In 2002. And since then he has attracted more attention than ever.
Speaker 2: I can't consider you as a little kid any more. I know he is very tall.
Speaker 1: Oh, You know something. He is 2. 26 meters tall. But he is also nimble and skillful.
Speaker 2: I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game.
Speaker 1: Yes, What's worse is he can't take any further part in the game.
Speaker 2: That's really terrible. Oh, God, We forgot to cheer for Daddy.
Speaker 1: Never mind. After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming, Right?
Speaker 2: You are always so naughty.
Speaker 1: No, I'm serious.
Speaker 1: How time flies! He's a big boy now.
Speaker 2: And don't forget Mary, Tom's twin sister. It's her birthday, Too.
Speaker 1: Ok. Let's invite all their little friends to come and celebrate.
Speaker 1: She passed out in class. Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days.
Speaker 2: Why on earth would she do that? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days? That's crazy!
Speaker 1: Yeah, But that's what she did.
Speaker 2: I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies. And all for a certain look.
Speaker 1: Well, It's not just the girl's fault. It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying, It's in to be thin. It's hard for them not to listen.
Speaker 2: True, But there are limits. Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another. No one forces them to do this.
Speaker 1: You haven't had any experience in either of those fields.
Speaker 2: I know. But I'd like to try. Look, Here are some advertisements that I've cut out.
Speaker 1: Very well. And my favorite subject is Chinese.
Speaker 2: I prefer to learn English. In my opinion, English is easier than Chinese.
Speaker 1: I guess English has fewer characters.
Speaker 2: You are right.
Speaker 1: I'm a doctor.
Speaker 2: Oh. Where do you work?
Speaker 1: New York University hospital in New York City. What do you do?
Speaker 2: I'm a teacher.
Speaker 1: What do you teach?
Speaker 2: I teach English.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: At a high school in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: That's nice. How old are you?
Speaker 2: I'm 32.
Speaker 1: Was she really? So you're telling me there's a chance?
Speaker 2: Can't hurt to try. Carpe diem. Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not?
Speaker 1: What do you think is the real danger man faced in space?
Speaker 2: The main one is radiation. There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space. The first is radiation from the sun, And this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface. The second, Less harmful, Comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts.
Speaker 1: Yeah. The final is next week. You have to watch it.
Speaker 1: I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, It's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, Polled air on the road?
Speaker 2: Well, Such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing. I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological. Bicycling home after work can help release your stress. Life in the offices is miserable. You just sit there in adaze, Gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents. Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work? Enjoy the speed on the road. Just think, You are flashing past the poles with your own energy. How great!
Speaker 1: What about your sister?
Speaker 2: She's not quite twenty-five.
Speaker 1: Do you miss your family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you often go home?
Speaker 2: No. But I often send e-mail to them. And make a call to my parents regularly.
Speaker 1: How often do you call to them?
Speaker 2: Once a week.
Speaker 1: You sound like the TV! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids, Are you?
Speaker 1: Ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?
Speaker 2: I've fallen in love with my boss.
Speaker 1: Really? Is he married?
Speaker 2: Bo, Of course not. He is still single.
Speaker 1: Then what's your problem?
Speaker 2: I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip.
Speaker 2: Worse still, He is trying to avoid me these days.
Speaker 1: Office romance is very tricky.
Speaker 2: It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.
Speaker 1: Cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine.
Speaker 1: Anything else?
Speaker 2: That's everything.
Speaker 1: I need your library card.
Speaker 2: I have it. Here you go.
Speaker 1: Do you need anything else?
Speaker 2: That's everything.
Speaker 1: Your books are due back two weeks from today.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Good night.
Speaker 1: I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries.
Speaker 2: So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary?
Speaker 1: It says that traditionally, Give something made of paper.
Speaker 2: I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money.
Speaker 1: You know how much I want to be on the team, And now there is an opening for me. If I don't go to practise today. They'll get someone else and I'll miss my chance.
Speaker 2: I don't care about baseball. You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday, And I did.
Speaker 1: I know, And I will.
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: After baseball practice.
Speaker 2: And then, It'll be dinner time, Then homework, And then your Show is on. You are going to break your promise.
Speaker 1: No, I won't. I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you.
Speaker 2: Well, I'd rather do it the way we set up. But if you promise to give me your best game, It's ok with me.
Speaker 1: No problem, I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks.
Speaker 1: You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents.
Speaker 2: Your parents are not like that?
Speaker 1: Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, They never expected much.
Speaker 2: You're lucky.
Speaker 1: What do you do to deal with the stress?
Speaker 2: Not much I can do. It's always there. I sometimes go out with some friends and drink, But that's only a temporary solution. The stress always returns in the morning.
Speaker 1: That sucks. You wanna go grab a beer?
Speaker 2: Sure. Sounds great. Let's go.
Speaker 1: Why do you say that?
Speaker 2: The sky is gray.
Speaker 1: Is it raining right now?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: How do you know?
Speaker 2: The street isn't wet.
Speaker 1: I have to go shopping today.
Speaker 2: You'd better take an umbrella.
Speaker 1: It's ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper body, Mainly your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio.
Speaker 1: In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be enough. Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.
Speaker 2: Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting? My goodness that's a lot of weight!
Speaker 1: It's not that much. Just watch... I'm ok...
Speaker 1: Friday then. How about it?
Speaker 2: Friday is great.
Speaker 1: It's settled then.
Speaker 1: How on earth can you miss several buses?
Speaker 2: I, Ah..., I got have late.
Speaker 1: Oh, Come on, Gordon, It's the afternoon now. Why were you late really?
Speaker 2: Well, I... I lost my wallet, And I...
Speaker 1: Have you got it now?
Speaker 2: Yes, I found it again.
Speaker 1: When?
Speaker 2: This morning. I mean...
Speaker 1: I am not convinced by your explanation.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah, And I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week. But you liked that movie, Didn't you?
Speaker 2: Oh, Sure, It was great. I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap.
Speaker 1: It wasn't that bad, And you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner. We went to an excellent restaurant.
Speaker 2: That place doesn't have a single meat dish. Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much.
Speaker 1: And I don't like meat that much. The only meat I eat is chicken.
Speaker 2: But when I pick the restaurant, We go to a place that has both chicken and fish. I always respect your food preferences.
Speaker 1: Well, I suppose that, To be fair, You should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat.
Speaker 2: Now you're talking, We can see that love story next time.
Speaker 1: Would you rather have her or your old boss back?
Speaker 2: She's far better than my old boss. He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down.
Speaker 1: How about your new co-workers?
Speaker 2: They are all pretty easy-going. It's a very friendly place to work.
Speaker 1: Do you miss your old co-workers?
Speaker 2: Of course. I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well. They were like family to me.
Speaker 1: Do people in different departments get along with each other?
Speaker 2: Sure. Since we work together in teams, We have to get along with each other.
Speaker 1: Do you like working in teams with people from different departments?
Speaker 2: Yes, It helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives.
Speaker 1: Do you like working in teams?
Speaker 2: I prefer it to working independently. I think most people do.
Speaker 1: It's May 1st.
Speaker 2: What day is that?
Speaker 1: It's Saturday. Could you make the time?
Speaker 2: Yes, Sure. What time will the wedding begin?
Speaker 1: At nine sharp.
Speaker 2: Very good! I'm looking forward to it. Please give my best regards to John. And I wish you best luck!
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 1: Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late?
Speaker 2: I'll call you if I'm delayed.
Speaker 1: It looks great, But you need something to go with it. It's too plain on its own.
Speaker 2: How about this blue sweater?
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. When did you buy it? Is it a name brand?
Speaker 2: Yes, But I bought it when it was on sale, 50 % off the original price. Ok, What do you think?
Speaker 1: That looks lovely. Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings.
Speaker 2: I've got a pair of pearl earrings. Here it is.
Speaker 1: Perfect!
Speaker 2: You have good fashion sense, Karen.
Speaker 1: Thanks. We should be ourselves. There are so many fashion victims out there.
Speaker 2: Yes, But with our sense we'll always look good.
Speaker 1: BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV.
Speaker 2: That's cool. I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable.
Speaker 1: No, It's great being a father, Seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you.
Speaker 2: Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day.
Speaker 1: Well have a good time. Get me some autographs if you can.
Speaker 2: Ok, I'll try my best.
Speaker 1: I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.
Speaker 2: But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together.
Speaker 1: I usually play with my schoolmates.
Speaker 2: Do you like watching football matches?
Speaker 1: Yes, I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday.
Speaker 1: It's a chilly day folks, So don't forget your coats! What about tomorrow Kenny? Do you have good news for us?
Speaker 2: Well, It'll be a rainy day for Northern Utah. We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning. Winds will be coming in from the North East, With gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour. Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening. Things are looking a bit better for the South. We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers. Later in the day, We can expect partlycloudy skies, With a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees.
Speaker 1: You heard it folks! It's gonna be a cold one!
Speaker 2: That's right Bill. We will have more later on today on the six o' clock news. That's the weather forecast for this morning.
Speaker 1: But I don't know what else I can do. I am willing to work hard. Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy.
Speaker 2: Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from.
Speaker 1: Tell that to my boss.
Speaker 2: Do you know Abraham Lincoln?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling, But he went on to become the President of United States.
Speaker 1: He was also assassinated because of his views.
Speaker 2: He is known as American's greatest president. Do you know why? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything. He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit.
Speaker 1: Well, If he can become president, Then I can at least get a promotion.
Speaker 2: That's the spirit. Never give up on your dream.
Speaker 1: Yes, I did. Have you lived here long?
Speaker 2: Me? I guess so. I've lived here for about six years now. Have you lived in America very long?
Speaker 1: No, Not really. When I left Vietnam, I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years. Where do you work, Alice?
Speaker 2: I teach mathematics at a college. What do you do?
Speaker 1: I am an accountant at a company.
Speaker 2: Well, Tom. It's good to meet you. I have to go now. I am teaching a class this evening, And I need to get to the college.
Speaker 1: It's nice meeting you too, Alice.
Speaker 2: See you around!
Speaker 1: Goodbye, Alice.
Speaker 1: Here's my license and form.
Speaker 2: You seem to have filled the form out all right. Are you familiar with our rules and fines?
Speaker 1: Yes, I know what to do.
Speaker 2: The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout.
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 2: Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you.
Speaker 1: So, Why did you apply for such a demanding job?
Speaker 2: Well, The government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance, Too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, That's the best part. All of my children can get free medical care.
Speaker 1: That's a great employment benefit!
Speaker 2: Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office!
Speaker 1: Wish him to be healthy soon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, That makes sense.
Speaker 1: I feel confused about the grammars.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best.
Speaker 1: And my writing is not good. I feel so frustrated.
Speaker 2: Be confident, And never give up.
Speaker 1: I know that, Mom. But sometimes I'm just sad.
Speaker 2: Keep your chin up. Remember? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.
Speaker 1: Yes, Mom. You are right. Nothing is impossible to a willing heart. I will keep going.
Speaker 1: Do you know where the visa office is?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's just near the Dong Si ShiTiao subway stop.
Speaker 2: That's not too far away. Do you think I'll get a visa?
Speaker 1: Have you ever gone abroad before?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've been to Tailband, Egypt, And Japan.
Speaker 1: Have you ever been denied a visa before?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: That's good. Are you planning on immigrating to another country?
Speaker 2: No, I want to come back to China after I graduate.
Speaker 1: That's exactly what the visa officers want to hear. Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board?
Speaker 2: I've received a full scholarship, So I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying.
Speaker 1: I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa. I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want.
Speaker 2: That's be great. The more prepared I am, The better.
Speaker 1: I'm from Long Island, New York. What about yourself?
Speaker 2: I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Wow. I really like California... The weather there is much better than the East Coast.
Speaker 2: Have you been to California?
Speaker 1: Just once. Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation. They had a blast.
Speaker 2: How many kids do you have?
Speaker 1: Two, A boy and a girl. They're already grown now.
Speaker 2: Well, California's changed over the last little while. You should come back out sometime.
Speaker 1: These books are two weeks late.
Speaker 2: I didn't have time to return them.
Speaker 1: You're going to have to pay late fees.
Speaker 2: How much?
Speaker 1: 25 cents a day.
Speaker 2: 25 cents a day?
Speaker 1: That means 25 cents for each late book.
Speaker 2: That's expensive.
Speaker 1: I haven't decided yet, But I think the OlympicMascots are a must.
Speaker 2: I agree. They're very lovely, Especially Huanhuan.
Speaker 1: Is that the red one? That is my favorite, Too. Do you know how much they are?
Speaker 2: The five dolls are sold together as a set, And they're priced according to the size. The bigger they are the more expensive.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. If I buy more than a set, Can I get any discount?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now.
Speaker 1: Any other ideas?
Speaker 2: There are lots of things, Such as postcards, Key chains, Posters and various arts and crafts.
Speaker 1: It all sounds great. We can go there after the match. I can't wait to see what they have.
Speaker 1: I just got off the subway. I'm almost there. Sorry I'm late.
Speaker 2: That's no problem. I just wanted to tell you I'm inside.
Speaker 1: Where are you?
Speaker 2: On the second floor.
Speaker 1: Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor?
Speaker 2: Come upstairs.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: Oh, Can you hear me OK? I said, Come to the second floor.
Speaker 1: Oh, Ok. What are you doing there?
Speaker 2: Just looking at some books on how to learn English.
Speaker 1: Do you want to get something to eat later?
Speaker 2: No, I'm still full from dinner.
Speaker 1: What do you want to do?
Speaker 2: I don't know for sure. When you get here we'll talk about it.
Speaker 1: Ok, See you soon.
Speaker 2: Bye.
Speaker 1: How do you think they could be ended?
Speaker 2: I don't think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that.
Speaker 1: So, If the cause is poverty, There should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, Share them.
Speaker 2: It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, It's harder to make peace between countries.
Speaker 1: Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive.
Speaker 2: The problem is that many poor people might suffer.
Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.
Speaker 2: You know, I often have to work til late at night. I need something to keep me awake.
Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your advice! I'll try it.
Speaker 1: Don't complain about it. She is concerned about your safety.
Speaker 2: You're right. Mother's love is the greatest love in the world.
Speaker 1: It's horrible.
Speaker 2: Yeah, We have to do something to help the people in the stricken area.
Speaker 1: Yes. How about donating some money?
Speaker 2: It's a good idea. But where can we donate money?
Speaker 1: Just find the answer through Internet.
Speaker 2: Yes, Let's do it now.
Speaker 1: What does she teach?
Speaker 2: English, Of course.
Speaker 1: Is she your teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes. She teaches our class three times a week.
Speaker 1: Can she speak Chinese to her students?
Speaker 2: Not very much.
Speaker 1: It's a good thing you can speak English!
Speaker 1: Really? I'm surprised.
Speaker 2: Me too.
Speaker 1: Oh, I am sorry. Maybe you were just emotional at that moment. Do you think you guys can get back together?
Speaker 2: I don't know. There's plenty of fish out there in the sea!
Speaker 1: Oh, You are such a dog!
Speaker 1: My birthday comes next month. I want to hold a birthday party, Too.
Speaker 2: I hope I can go to your party.
Speaker 1: Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening?
Speaker 2: No, Why?
Speaker 1: My friend, Who had the mishap, Wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her.
Speaker 2: She doesn't need to do that, I didn't do anything.
Speaker 1: She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that. Come on, Let's indulge her.
Speaker 1: It's so hot at lunchtime ; I'd rather run in the morning.
Speaker 2: Well, Why don't you come tomorrow? I'll stop by your house on my way out.
Speaker 1: I could try, But I can't say for sure if I'll get up in time. What time do you want to go?
Speaker 2: I'll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty.
Speaker 1: O. K., Maybe if I have someone to go with, I'll be able to get up in time for a jog.
Speaker 2: Great, I'll see you then.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: But I heard it might rain.
Speaker 1: No. I recorded these from your Cds.
Speaker 2: Well, Thanks for asking for my permission... Now hand it over and let me record!
Speaker 1: I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy...
Speaker 1: How about languages?
Speaker 2: Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does.
Speaker 1: Um. That doesn't really matter. Because we have more French visitors than German.
Speaker 1: Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii.
Speaker 2: How was it?
Speaker 1: I had a good time. You seem to be in a hurry. Don't let me hold you up.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I've got a meeting in half an hour.
Speaker 1: Ok, I won't keep you then.
Speaker 2: Great! It's good to see you. Goodbye!
Speaker 1: Yes, Stay in touch. Bye!
Speaker 2: Give me your email, Would you?
Speaker 1: Sure! It'stxyb@gmail. Com.
Speaker 1: Yeah but, He is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, He always shuts down and brushes me off.
Speaker 2: Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, Anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.
Speaker 1: I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know...
Speaker 2: Talk to him, Try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!
Speaker 1: You are something else you know that?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm from Chicago. There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors.
Speaker 2: So, Tell me, Karl, Why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live?
Speaker 1: We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space. Another reason is, We can afford to buy a home here, But we can't in Chicago!
Speaker 1: Please yourself.
Speaker 1: I can't believe it! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure.
Speaker 2: What were the odds?
Speaker 1: 20 to 1, In favour of the Cougars!
Speaker 2: Too bad.
Speaker 1: What about tonight? Do you have plans tonight?
Speaker 2: No, Do you want to go and do something?
Speaker 1: Yes, Yes, I want to take you to dinner.
Speaker 2: Oh, That sounds great. How about 6 o 'clock?
Speaker 1: Yes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.
Speaker 2: Sure. That's not a problem. Do you have the list of courses you want totaketh semester?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Here's my list. I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.
Speaker 2: Yeah, That's perfect. What about the subjects for your minor?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah! Almost forgot! I need to take fundamental linguistics, Consumer psychology and neuroanatomy.
Speaker 2: Wow, You are going to be busy this semester! Okay, Here you go. You are registered now. You'll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.
Speaker 1: As the city grew, It must have absorbed many village nearby.
Speaker 2: Yes, It did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city.
Speaker 1: I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive. Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs. There was a castle near one village, So our city has a castle too.
Speaker 1: Really? So your city does have some old history after all.
Speaker 1: And how about your Spanish?
Speaker 2: Well, It's not as good as my French. I can speak it reasonably well, But my written Spanish isn't very good.
Speaker 1: I see. Well, We have a lot of Spanish customers, But you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here.
Speaker 2: In that case, I'm fit for the position I think.
Speaker 1: All information is filled in and now I can design my zone.
Speaker 2: You can choose one type to make it as your background, And then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it, So your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone.
Speaker 1: Now everything is OK. I can write my blog, Right?
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: ( Half an hour, Janice begins shouting excitedly. ) What's the matter with you?
Speaker 2: Look! David gives his following-comment on my first blog. He is my first visitor.
Speaker 1: But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department. It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday.
Speaker 2: That is the down side of an office romance. I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress. The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case.
Speaker 1: Well, Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work, Easier set them done. But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup.
Speaker 1: Well, It pays off for her. How old is she anyway?
Speaker 2: She will be 86 next month.
Speaker 1: That is truly amazing!
Speaker 1: Yes. I graduated last year and got a job in a press.
Speaker 1: Yes, My customers have started to complain too!
Speaker 2: Oh look! Here it comes now!
Speaker 1: No, Thank you.
Speaker 2: That's the most important thing.
Speaker 1: It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid.
Speaker 2: Forget about it.
Speaker 1: When you lent me the bike, It looked brand new, Almost anyway.
Speaker 2: Maybe, But really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.
Speaker 1: I appreciate that, Thank you.
Speaker 1: I like collecting antiques. It's expensive, But it's a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: Really? How many collections do you have?
Speaker 1: So far I have more than 500 collections.
Speaker 2: Among those collections, Which is the most expensive?
Speaker 1: A set of ancient china. It is really invaluable.
Speaker 1: What about the quality?
Speaker 2: Superb! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear.
Speaker 1: Well, You've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then.
Speaker 2: Oh, We'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by. How does it sound, David?
Speaker 1: It sounds good. You can do a lot of sightseeing, Too.
Speaker 2: Yes, We'll take our time. And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street.
Speaker 1: So, You're going to have a really nice vacation.
Speaker 2: You can say that again.
Speaker 1: For how many guests, Please?
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: How much would you like to spend?
Speaker 2: We don't care about money. We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties.
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 2: How many courses are there altogether, Please?
Speaker 1: Eight.
Speaker 2: Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner?
Speaker 1: Sure. The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: If so, We may live there someday.
Speaker 2: I hope so. Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month?
Speaker 1: Sure. I heard about this on the TV. On January 3rd, 2004, Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater. And three weeks later, Spirit's twin explorer, Opportunity, Landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists.
Speaker 2: Yes. Both have sent back pictures of the planet. And the latter did a better job.
Speaker 1: I can see that. But I didn't know you had experience in that line of work.
Speaker 2: I didn't, But I applied for an apprenticeship, And since I studied math, And I have a good attitude, My application was accepted.
Speaker 1: Congratulations! You do have the right attitude.
Speaker 1: It just happened to be the highest grade in the class.
Speaker 2: You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did. Admit it.
Speaker 1: I worked hard too. But she always gives me a lower grade.
Speaker 2: If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it.
Speaker 1: Two of my classes occur at the same time.
Speaker 2: Well, I can see that's a problem.
Speaker 1: Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?
Speaker 1: I want to keep both of them, If that's possible.
Speaker 2: Well, Let me find you one of these classes on a different day.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: It's the tradition. But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri.
Speaker 2: In any case, I like baby showers, Because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world.
Speaker 1: So you will come, Won't you?
Speaker 2: Of course. I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: The World Cup! The first match is today! It's Mexico vs. South Africa! It's going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, And all.
Speaker 1: I have no idea what you're talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.
Speaker 2: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, Man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, Each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals.
Speaker 1: Sounds interesting, But soccer doesn't really appeal to me.
Speaker 2: Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It's a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, Hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they're really good!
Speaker 1: All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down, Trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like asissy sport to me!
Speaker 2: Whatever dude, I'm going to go watch the opening match.
Speaker 1: Tell me what it says!
Speaker 2: I didn't get in.
Speaker 1: You're lying.
Speaker 2: I'm not lying.
Speaker 1: Are you upset?
Speaker 2: I had high hopes for NYU.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry you didn't get accepted.
Speaker 2: Hopefully, I'll get accepted to UCLA.
Speaker 1: According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.
Speaker 2: I am sure I can get a 95 this time.
Speaker 1: I have been looking forward to this performance all month.
Speaker 2: I'm really sorry I let you down. I'll make it up to you somehow.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know the details, But...
Speaker 1: Geez! Now that I think about it, Maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, And I didn't become addicted or anything like that.
Speaker 2: You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize!
Speaker 1: But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money.
Speaker 2: Mmm, You may be right.
Speaker 1: Do you think we'll need our overcoats?
Speaker 2: No. We couldn't possibly.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: It will be summer. So it will be hot.
Speaker 1: Is that very likely in England?
Speaker 2: Yes. It could happen.
Speaker 1: I know what you mean.
Speaker 2: I want to give a gift that is really meaningful.
Speaker 1: Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them.
Speaker 2: Or what only we are able to give them.
Speaker 1: So maybe we shouldn't go out after all.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Let's just lounge around!
Speaker 1: Oh right... Present company excluded, Of course!
Speaker 1: Does five thirty work for you?
Speaker 2: That will be fine. What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time.
Speaker 1: Is it the plans for my new house?
Speaker 2: Yes. I just need to double check a few details with you.
Speaker 1: I agree, I had lunch there last week.
Speaker 2: Excellent! That sounds like a plan.
Speaker 1: Hear me out. We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it!
Speaker 2: But you may have some trouble convincing the kids.
Speaker 1: Actual 1y, It was their idea first.
Speaker 2: Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas.
Speaker 1: Yes, I really need someone who is really good.
Speaker 2: I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you do that?
Speaker 1: Maybe, But I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Man, This guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, Don't you?
Speaker 1: No, That stuff isn't important to me.
Speaker 2: Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?
Speaker 1: I don't care about any of that.
Speaker 2: We all are looking for different things in an instructor. I hope I've helped you.
Speaker 1: Football of course!
Speaker 2: Oh... Football. Football is cool. I usually try to catch the World Cup finals.
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about American football. The World Cup is soccer.
Speaker 2: Oh, I understand. I can't say I'm a big fan. I'm from China, And football doesn't have a really big following over there.
Speaker 1: So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut. When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?
Speaker 1: Oh, Certainly. I wouldn't miss a game for the world. My girlfriend says I have an addiction. And actually, If I had to choose between her and my games... I'd probably pick football.
Speaker 2: It seems Americans are very passionate about sports. Is this just a part of your culture?
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young. Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together.
Speaker 1: Yes. I have to drive to WashingtonD. C.
Speaker 2: What bad luck!
Speaker 1: Yeah! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct. Maybe tomorrow is a clear day. Who knows?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Maybe you are right!
Speaker 1: You're right. The invitation said two to seven. I was there at two o'clock, But most people didn't arrive until three or four. They didn't start cooking until five o 'clock.
Speaker 2: Cookouts often start slowly. A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two.
Speaker 1: Thanks for telling me this.
Speaker 2: I was late getting back from the mall, But I'm hurrying.
Speaker 1: Why are you in such a hurry? They said, Dinner at eight, And it's only seven-fifteen. I don't want to be the first one there again.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. We won't be the first.
Speaker 1: Why haven't I thought of this skill?
Speaker 2: I use short messages quite a lot. If it's not too complicated I will send a short message, Which can save much phone charge.
Speaker 1: I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call, And only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year, Didn't it?
Speaker 2: I almost can't live without messages, From which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy yourself?
Speaker 2: Very much. New York is such a nice place. Shall I show you some photographs?
Speaker 1: Thanks, I like looking at photographs. How nice! Oh, I'm afraid I must be going now. I've got an appointment. Have a good day.
Speaker 2: You too. I hope to see you soon. Goodbye.
Speaker 1: Goodbye.
Speaker 1: A little bird whispered to me. Keep that to yourself.
Speaker 1: It's really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed early.
Speaker 2: What's the temperature?
Speaker 1: It's 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning.
Speaker 2: Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?
Speaker 1: I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow.
Speaker 2: I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.
Speaker 1: Me too. How's the weather where you are?
Speaker 2: It's not too bad, But it's pretty cold here too. It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon. I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii.
Speaker 2: How was it?
Speaker 1: I had a good time. You seem to be in a hurry. Don't let me hold you up.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I've got a meeting in half an hour.
Speaker 1: Ok, I won't keep you then.
Speaker 2: Great! It's good to see you. Goodbye!
Speaker 1: Yes, Stay in touch. Bye!
Speaker 2: Give me your email, Would you?
Speaker 1: Sure! It'stxyb@gmail. Com.
Speaker 1: You did a good job. I'm extremely proud of you.
Speaker 2: Thanks for the compliment.
Speaker 1: You certainly deserve it. Let's celebrate!
Speaker 1: Yeah, It can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, But then I started going out, Keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.
Speaker 2: I see what you mean, But I'm still bummed out.
Speaker 1: Ok. How does this sound, Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there!
Speaker 2: You know, I could really go for that. You don't mind being my wingman for tonight?
Speaker 1: Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys 'night out... Well kinda...
Speaker 2: Great! I must warn you though, Whatever happens, Don't let me go on a drinking binge. Trust me, It's not a pretty picture!
Speaker 1: Well, All the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. Your sister lives there. She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go. It's true there are some dangerous places in big American cities. But if your sister lives there, She must know the city pretty well already.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm not really scared. Maybe only a little.
Speaker 1: Don't believe what you see on TV. You will have a good time in New York. What things do you want to see?
Speaker 2: I want to see the museums, And I want to shop a lot.
Speaker 1: The museums are excellent. And the shopping! Well! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there.
Speaker 2: Hmm. I hope not.
Speaker 1: Is a shop there?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, You know I'm not familiar with the city, Too.
Speaker 1: Oh, I forget. Sorry.
Speaker 2: I went to Harvard University.
Speaker 1: Did you? And what course did you take there?
Speaker 2: God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?
Speaker 1: I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.
Speaker 2: I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?
Speaker 1: Terrific! B. A., Again and again-B. A.
Speaker 1: Ahh. And how about on Sunday? Did you watch the football?
Speaker 2: No I didn't. I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband.
Speaker 1: I wasn't feeling well.
Speaker 2: Here they are.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes?
Speaker 2: Oh, No, This is the rest.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: It's no problem at all.
Speaker 1: How Ay clients do you have already?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients.
Speaker 1: Wow. Too bad I don't have a clue about housework.
Speaker 2: If you ever need a job, Let me know. I can always train you.
Speaker 1: Yes. In fact, One of the categories is on foreign language films.
Speaker 1: Can I help you in anyway?
Speaker 2: You can take me to the bank if you want to.
Speaker 1: Sure. Let's go.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 2: We can't put up with it any more.
Speaker 1: We'll play the CD loud, Is that all right?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: What should we do?
Speaker 2: Why don't we call them?
Speaker 1: Good idea.
Speaker 1: A piece of cake?
Speaker 2: Yes. It's easy and convenient to use a computer. But it takes a long time to really master it.
Speaker 1: No, I was good at the long jump. I liked the sprints best.
Speaker 2: Did you ever win any competitions?
Speaker 1: I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters. I usually did well in thedong jump competitions, But I couldn't compete with kids from other schools in the javelin. How about you?
Speaker 2: I came second and third a few times in the regional championships, But I never won. Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events?
Speaker 1: Yes, I did, But I didn't do very well. I made the final in both events, But came last. At least I made the final. I was very pleased with that.
Speaker 1: Ok, I am going to the hotel to pick you up. See you tomorrow night.
Speaker 1: So it is no wonder people cannot keep faith with it.
Speaker 1: No. But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there.
Speaker 2: That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me.
Speaker 1: Come on. You're great at teaching and I know you will love him. He's adorable!
Speaker 2: Oh, All right. Have him come over here for dinner. But you get to make dinner!
Speaker 1: Not bad. You know I'm an air traffic controller now.
Speaker 2: Now that's an exciting job!!!
Speaker 1: Yes, But it's very stressful.
Speaker 1: How moving love is.
Speaker 1: You are crazy. Gambling is against my principles.
Speaker 1: They're not all right. They're uncomfortable and they look terrible.
Speaker 2: All right. All right.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, We can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.
Speaker 1: What else can we do to protect the environment?
Speaker 2: If you do have to drive, You should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, Your home should use sources of renewable energy.
Speaker 1: How about recycling? Does that actually help?
Speaker 2: Yes. You should take your glass, Paper, Plastic, Cardboard, And tin cans to a recycling center.
Speaker 1: What do you think is the biggest worry for our future?
Speaker 2: I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone.
Speaker 1: I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before!
Speaker 2: To be honest, In order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place, We're all going to have to become more interested in the environment.
Speaker 1: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: Thanks so much. I owe you one.
Speaker 1: So I take it you're pretty bored too.
Speaker 2: Just killing time until I find something to do. What are you going to do?
Speaker 1: It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing. What's wrong with us?
Speaker 2: You wanna shoot some hoops?
Speaker 1: I already tried to call up some of the guys, But they are all busy.
Speaker 2: Where's your girlfriend? I thought you were going out with her today.
Speaker 1: She's out shopping with her friends.
Speaker 2: Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then.
Speaker 1: Aright. Do you have any cigarettes?
Speaker 2: I only have a couple left. Why don't you pick some up on the way.
Speaker 1: Ok. See you there in about 30 minutes.
Speaker 2: Aright. See you there.
Speaker 1: I see. You simply can't blame the server for this.
Speaker 2: Yes, I know. Fast food is so popular in this district.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: Anyway, How was your such, Catherine?
Speaker 1: It was good. I brough lunch from home today.
Speaker 2: You did? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America.
Speaker 1: Well, I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy.
Speaker 2: I guess you're right. More often than not, People go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, But generally speaking, They are high in calories, Salt and fat.
Speaker 1: Yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle, Don't you?
Speaker 2: You bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America.
Speaker 1: Well, Actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places.
Speaker 2: Seriously?
Speaker 1: Yeah, It's hard to believe but true.
Speaker 1: I understand that. But I think maybe it's not a date. You are taking the matter too much to heart.
Speaker 2: Maybe. But it still gets on my nerves.
Speaker 1: Yes. He was released from hospital yesterday evening. The other man could be there for weeks.
Speaker 2: I understand that he's connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus. His condition can't be very good.
Speaker 1: The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable. What does that mean?
Speaker 2: It means he's really badly injured, But he will almost certainly survive.
Speaker 1: His family will be pleased to hear that. They must have been so worried.
Speaker 1: How happy you are! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam.
Speaker 1: No, You don't! It's still beeping! Come on, Hand it over and I'll turn it off for you.
Speaker 1: Hmm, That's all right. Shall we meet at the bar near the beach?
Speaker 2: All right. See you then.
Speaker 1: No, No. I am okay. It's the weather. It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining.
Speaker 2: Really, John. I still think you should go to a doctor. You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning. Why don't you take this afternoon off? If you don't want to see a doctor, At least you can go home and have a good rest.
Speaker 1: I can't. I am already behind the schedule. Besides, You know Mr. White. He would think that I was putting him on.
Speaker 2: You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning, And you can't do anything this afternoon like this. Gee! You've got a fever.
Speaker 1: Do I? Oh, No.
Speaker 2: Listen to me. You go home now. I will call my doctor and have him go over. Ok?
Speaker 1: What about Mr. White?
Speaker 2: I'll handle him. Now go home. I'll call you after work.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot, Eve. Goodbye.
Speaker 1: That'd be great! Thank you.
Speaker 1: Because of the low salaries.
Speaker 2: But your company is huge. Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages?
Speaker 1: I don't know why.
Speaker 2: Why don't you give them a suggestion?
Speaker 1: May be I can have a try. But I'm on vacation now.
Speaker 1: Well, I hope you'll feel better soon.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your concern.
Speaker 1: True, But I still have to watch my baseball. The season's in full swing now.
Speaker 2: I mean, I know spring training's over, But I'm just not into all that.
Speaker 1: Hello? Is the real Taylor in there?
Speaker 1: I want a rematch. Let's play again.
Speaker 2: Sorry, Not tonight!
Speaker 1: I swear, The overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller!
Speaker 2: That's so true. Thanks for your help. Are you in the aisle seat in this row?
Speaker 1: Yes. What about you?
Speaker 2: I'm in the middle seat.
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess I'll let you through then.
Speaker 2: Thanks. Sorry for making you get out of your seat again.
Speaker 1: That's alright. I notice you have a few newspapers there. Would you mind lending me one?
Speaker 2: No, Not at all. Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian?
Speaker 1: I prefer the British paper, But I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away.
Speaker 2: I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off, So the Guardian is all yours.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot. That's really nice of you. Would you like a piece of gum?
Speaker 2: That would be great. Thanks.
Speaker 1: Just what I thought!
Speaker 1: I know. I know!
Speaker 2: Let's think this through. First of all, You cannot leave Amy at the altar. Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, But she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this? Second of all, You are just getting cold feet. You know deep down inside that you want to marry her, So cut the crap and do it!
Speaker 1: You're right. I'm being crazy! Ok, I'm ready, Let's do this!
Speaker 2: Great! Phew! That was a close one! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you.
Speaker 1: I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's so nice of you to comfort me.
Speaker 1: What does she teach?
Speaker 2: English, Of course.
Speaker 1: Is she your teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes. She teaches our class three times a week.
Speaker 1: Can she speak Chinese to her students?
Speaker 2: Not very much.
Speaker 1: It's a good thing you can speak English!
Speaker 1: I know. I was watching are-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored.
Speaker 2: Me too. Let's get together and do something.
Speaker 1: I'd like to, But I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow?
Speaker 2: I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny.
Speaker 1: That's great. We can do something outdoors then.
Speaker 2: Are there any special events going on tomorrow?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out.
Speaker 1: Do you know what time it starts?
Speaker 2: It starts at one PM.
Speaker 1: Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards, We can head over there.
Speaker 2: Perfect. I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty.
Speaker 1: So what are you interested in?
Speaker 2: Magazines about fashions, Such as Cosmo Polian.
Speaker 1: I know that magazine. It's very popular.
Speaker 2: Yes. I can lend you some.
Speaker 1: Thank you. But I'm not interested.
Speaker 1: Good. Shall we say seven o'clock?
Speaker 2: I'll be there. You're still a fabulous cook, Aren't you?
Speaker 1: That'll be for you to decide. I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you.
Speaker 2: I'm ready. I'll look forward to it all Friday!
Speaker 1: Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, They are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It's difficult and boring.
Speaker 1: It's true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. Once a week.
Speaker 2: But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don't students want to have a good memory?
Speaker 1: Of course. I didn't know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?
Speaker 2: Well, Do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, Doing aerobics, Going bicycling, And playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know. Thank you.
Speaker 1: What kind of sport do you like to participate in?
Speaker 2: I am good at tennis and skiing. What about you?
Speaker 1: I prefer the indoor sports, Such as bowling, Badminton and squash.
Speaker 2: Moderate exercise is really important for health. 'Life lies in movement.'.
Speaker 1: How about playing tennis with me?
Speaker 2: Good idea. I will take the racket.
Speaker 1: Nice to meet you.
Speaker 2: Do you have any experience using weights?
Speaker 1: No, I don't. So I need some help.
Speaker 2: Well, First it is important to go through a good stretch. You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room. So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines.
Speaker 2: Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you.
Speaker 1: What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one.
Speaker 2: No. Not that. I mean a training card. The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine. Here, Let me show you.
Speaker 1: I'm ready.
Speaker 2: Now, You can see that on this card there are all the machines listed. So, When you go through the series of twelve machines, You enter in the number of repetitions you do. And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine.
Speaker 1: I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress.
Speaker 2: Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine. Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them. And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you.
Speaker 1: Alright. Great.
Speaker 2: So you write your name and member number at the top of the card. And then, After you exercise each time, You file the card here.
Speaker 1: Great. Why don't we start on the machines?
Speaker 2: Are you alright? Can you do more?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted.
Speaker 2: That's okay. Don't worry. It's important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning.
Speaker 1: What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines.
Speaker 2: We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really. The most important thing is to know your limits. So if you feel burned out now, It is good to stop. Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, Then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right?
Speaker 1: Yes. I suppose it's best to stop.
Speaker 1: I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at!
Speaker 2: Doesn't everyone? Which games are those?
Speaker 1: Well, I like to play darts. Whenever I go to a bar, I usually play for a few hours.
Speaker 2: Did you play a lot of games when you were little?
Speaker 1: My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes. We used to have family tournaments every weekend.
Speaker 2: Do you still like playing those games?
Speaker 1: Not at all. I never really did, To be honest. What about you? Did your family used to play games together?
Speaker 2: Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games.
Speaker 1: Some of my friends play cards on the internet. Have you ever tried that?
Speaker 2: No, I prefer to play with people I know.
Speaker 1: How about mah-jong?
Speaker 2: It's a popular game with some people, But I've never played it.
Speaker 1: I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong!
Speaker 2: I hate to disappoint you, But unlike what most people think, We aren't all exactly the same!
Speaker 1: He's a postman.
Speaker 2: I thought she would marry a fortune.
Speaker 1: Yes, It's beautiful, But it's also very hot.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's the weather like in your country?
Speaker 2: Mm... It's quite warm now.
Speaker 1: Where do you live?
Speaker 2: In London. Where do you live?
Speaker 1: Here. Near this school.
Speaker 1: We should come here more often.
Speaker 2: You are absolutely right.
Speaker 1: I'd like to come back next weekend.
Speaker 2: That's exactly the way I feel.
Speaker 1: Oh, That would be very useful.
Speaker 1: Someone calledDrexler. CarlDrexler. He's been with the company onlytwo years. I've been here longer. And I know more about the job, Too.
Speaker 2: Hmm. Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you?
Speaker 1: Because I'm the wrong sex, Of course!
Speaker 2: You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman?
Speaker 1: Yes, That was probably it! It isn't fair.
Speaker 2: What sort of clothes does he wear?
Speaker 1: A dark suit. White shirt. A tie. Why?
Speaker 2: Perhaps that had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater?
Speaker 2: It's possible, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Do you really think I should wear different clothes?
Speaker 2: Well... Perhaps you should think about it.
Speaker 1: Why should I wear a skirt? Or a dress?
Speaker 2: I'm not saying you should. I'm saying you should think about it. That's all!
Speaker 1: Why should I do that? I'm good at my job! That's the only important thing!
Speaker 2: Hmm. Perhaps it should be the only important thing. But it isn't. Not in this company.
Speaker 1: No, I'm a Britisher. Where do you come from?
Speaker 2: I come from America. Are you a freshman?
Speaker 1: Yes. What about you?
Speaker 2: Me, Too.
Speaker 1: Great. Maybe we can study and play games together. I think we can be good friends.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Anytime.
Speaker 1: The problem is you are too nervous. You want to have a strike so much, So you deliver the ball too hard. And when it comes to the I second roll, There's no pressure. That's why you could bowl all those spares.
Speaker 2: Really? I will try again.
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 1: No. I'm busy then too. I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road. Are you free on Thursday afternoon?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think I am. Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant.
Speaker 1: Good idea! Is two o'clock okay?
Speaker 2: That's fine. See you there!
Speaker 1: The best thing to do is study as much as you can. I'm sure you'll do alright.
Speaker 2: I hope so. I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days. That's what it'll take.
Speaker 1: I have to study for an exam too. Why don't we study together. We can encourage each other.
Speaker 2: That will be great.
Speaker 1: First, The visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information. They can sign up for a free monthly drawing. Once we've got their info, It goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting. Also, There are clear links to descriptions of our products and services, So as to give confidence to new customers. We also added a specific area for on-line customer service... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback...
Speaker 2: Great!
Speaker 1: Well, Not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people fromSichuan and Guizhou provinces can. Back where I come from, People don't eat a lot of papers and chilies.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed inSichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while though, I got used to the taste, And now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, You can increase you tolerance for spicy food, But so far, I haven't had the need or the opportunity. Every time I try spicy food, It is a total disaster for my nose and eyes.
Speaker 2: I completely understand. I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either, But when you have no other choices, You've got to adapt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's a typical example of 'when in Rome, Do as the Romans do.'.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work. Supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, And they also take the blame, That's what happened to my old boss...
Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.
Speaker 2: You know, I often have to work till late at night. I need something to keep me awake.
Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your advice! I'll try it.
Speaker 1: Wow! Isn't that dangerous?
Speaker 2: A little, But the rush was worth it.
Speaker 1: Tell me about it.
Speaker 2: We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us.
Speaker 1: 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It was scary, But exhilarating.
Speaker 1: What's the temperature?
Speaker 2: It's 20 degrees below zero now. It was even colder this morning.
Speaker 1: Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?
Speaker 2: I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.
Speaker 2: Me too. How's the weather where you are?
Speaker 1: It's not too bad, But it's pretty cold here too. I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I really did! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago.
Speaker 2: Well, It was definitely worth all the time.
Speaker 1: Let's just hope my teacher agrees.
Speaker 1: Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'd forgotten about it.
Speaker 1: Forgotten about it? How could you?
Speaker 2: Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Speaker 2: It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian.
Speaker 1: I guess so. So what do you do around this time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll celebrate Hanukah soon, But that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you. Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break.
Speaker 1: Well, Would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house?
Speaker 2: Not at all. A party is a party. I'll be happy to come.
Speaker 1: Sure. Wait a moment. ( Several minutes later ) Here you are.
Speaker 2: I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool.
Speaker 1: I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight. Maybe I will suck their blood.
Speaker 2: Haha. Wish you good luck.
Speaker 1: So, What did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, Obviously.
Speaker 2: I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't get through a whole game before I had to sit down.
Speaker 1: Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming?
Speaker 2: I wanted to, But the water is too cold, And I just wetted in up to my knees.
Speaker 1: It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that.
Speaker 2: It looks like you could use it. Don't tell me you spent the weekend in the library again.
Speaker 1: Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, Using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins. Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive! Now what about the organs that help us digest food?
Speaker 2: The stomach and intestines!
Speaker 1: Very good! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste. Are we forgetting anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah! Our kidneys, Liver and bladder!
Speaker 1: Oh yes, You are right. Very important organs indeed.
Speaker 2: So what do these organs do, Teacher?
Speaker 1: Well,Mumm, They... Time for a break! We can talk about it when you get back.
Speaker 1: Good for you! What are you doing?
Speaker 2: I'm a professional party planner here in the city. I do catering and all that.
Speaker 1: I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun!
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know about the profit part yet. But I am really having fun!
Speaker 1: Did you buy new cupboards too?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't. I gave them a really good clean, So they just look new. The worktop was in poor condition, So I had a new one added.
Speaker 1: I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils.
Speaker 2: Yes, I have. I need them to help me with these new dished I'm trying to make. I need a little more practice before I invite guests over.
Speaker 1: Looking at the spice rack, I'd say you'Ve been learning how to make asian food.
Speaker 2: Yes. I'Ve always likes Indian and thai food, So I'Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries. I'm pretty good at making curries now, But I still need practice at making thai food.
Speaker 1: Both kinds of food are becoming popular. Nowadays, It's very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket.
Speaker 2: I hope you can stay for dinner. I need a guinea pig!
Speaker 1: I see. Do you ski often?
Speaker 2: Every chance I get. On weekends I ski all day long. Sometimes I even ski at night.
Speaker 1: That sounds great.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. The ski slopes are well lit. It's really nice to ski at night. Why don't you learn to ski?
Speaker 1: Not on your life! I know I'd break my leg.
Speaker 2: Don't be so frightened. It's just a skill.
Speaker 1: The one that said, You're a creep. From me you won't hear another peep. I hope you wreck your jeep.
Speaker 2: Right. That one. Did it work?
Speaker 1: Ok, We will let you know as early as possible. By the way, Will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation?
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: That's all right. I hope we can help you at some other time. Good-bye.
Speaker 1: Good-bye.
Speaker 1: Oh my, No internet access is killing me.
Speaker 2: Can't you wait till you get home? Then you can surf the internet using the broadband, Wireless connection or whatever you like.
Speaker 1: No, I'm not feeling myself. I just want to check my emails, Visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends.
Speaker 2: Now I see, You must be suffering from discomgoogolation.
Speaker 1: What does that mean? There's nothing wrong with me.
Speaker 2: Well, The term 'discomgoogolation' comes from 'discombobulate' and 'google'. Because floods of information are just a mouse click away, Net users are very likely to become addicted to the web.
Speaker 1: That's alright. I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information. It almost drives me crazy.
Speaker 2: Then, You're probably addicted.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, Do not take naps during the day, And yet they can be so heavy.
Speaker 2: You see, Because we are often busy working, We eat too much fast food, And that food is very fattening.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: On my first trip I went to Tokyo, And on my second trip I visited Kyoto.
Speaker 1: What did you think of Tokyo?
Speaker 2: Very big and exciting, But very crowded, Too.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I've seen pictures of the crowds!
Speaker 2: And the restaurant are excellent... But they're kind of expensive.
Speaker 1: And how about Kyoto?
Speaker 2: Kyoto is lovely. It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens. It's a very historic city.
Speaker 1: How was the weather?
Speaker 2: I was in Tokyo in August, And it was really hot and humid. I went to Kyoto in October. It was hot and sunny, But there was no humidity.
Speaker 1: Sounds perfect. I can't wait!
Speaker 1: Here you are. You must return them within a month.
Speaker 2: What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month?
Speaker 1: You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them.
Speaker 2: Ok. Thank you very much for your trouble.
Speaker 1: No trouble at all. So long.
Speaker 1: Susan suggested the one on Main Street. She says it is very good.
Speaker 2: Which one is that?
Speaker 1: You know, The one just on the corner with Oxford Street. There is a large pharmacy next door.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I know which one you mean. I have never been there, But I looked at their menu once and it did look good.
Speaker 1: Okay then. I think we will all meet outside?
Speaker 2: What time?
Speaker 1: At 8 o'clock. I will make the reservation.
Speaker 2: That's good. See you on Friday.
Speaker 1: It was always very busy there.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: I stood behind the register and took pizza orders.
Speaker 2: Did you get any perks on the job?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free.
Speaker 1: I see. Thank you.
Speaker 1: That sucks.
Speaker 2: I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies.
Speaker 1: Look on the bright side. At least you have a job.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I shouldn't stress about this anymore. It's not like I can do anything about it.
Speaker 1: Exactly. Instead, We should have some drinks tonight.
Speaker 2: How about a cold bottle of beer.
Speaker 1: Now you're talking.
Speaker 1: It's better for right-handed people like me. See, I don't even have to move my arm to see the time.
Speaker 2: I'm left-handed. You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it...
Speaker 1: Bingo!
Speaker 1: That's fine. I want 2 tickets.
Speaker 1: And how long does the course last?
Speaker 2: It lasts for 9 months.
Speaker 1: When does it start?
Speaker 2: The next beginning class starts on October 25th.
Speaker 1: What time is the class?
Speaker 2: From 7 to 9 o'clock.
Speaker 1: How much does it cost?
Speaker 2: It costs 125 dollars a month.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's all right. I want to enroll in the course.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Please fill out this form for us.
Speaker 1: Do you want me to fill it out now?
Speaker 2: Yes, Please. We need a record of you education and your work experiences.
Speaker 1: Oh, Don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long.
Speaker 2: That's right. We got the assignment last week.
Speaker 1: When is it due?
Speaker 2: Next Monday!
Speaker 1: Remind me never to sign up for that course!
Speaker 1: My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!
Speaker 2: Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married?
Speaker 1: If I told her that, She would faint and have me committed!
Speaker 1: Do you want me to take a look?
Speaker 2: No, Thank you. I think I can handle it.
Speaker 1: Well, If you change your mind, Let me know.
Speaker 2: I will. Thanks. That's sweet of you.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: I might need some tools though. Do you know where I can get some?
Speaker 1: Sure. I have all kinds of tools. Just ask. I'll be happy to get them for you.
Speaker 2: Thanks. That would be very helpful.
Speaker 1: Anything for you. Seriously, I don't mind helping.
Speaker 2: Ok. If you really insist, I could always use the company.
Speaker 1: This city is really comfortable to living.
Speaker 2: It sure is.
Speaker 1: No other city can match it. It's heaven.
Speaker 2: Well, If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much.
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 2: That's for sure.
Speaker 1: They see their independence as a kind of character strength.
Speaker 2: Sometimes they are too independent.
Speaker 1: I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.
Speaker 2: Maybe you don't believe it, But it was made by my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Really? It looks so nice.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Please have a cup of tea.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: How about some fish?
Speaker 1: No, Thanks. I've had enough. Now, Mary, Before you blow out the birthday candles, You have to make a wish. After that, You may cut the cake.
Speaker 2: Ok, Let me make a wish... Do you want a big piece of cake?
Speaker 1: No, Just a small one. Next let's sing 'Happy Birthday' to Mary.
Speaker 2: It is very kind of you. I'm so moved by you.
Speaker 1: Is it due to old age or is he sick.
Speaker 2: Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth.
Speaker 1: That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life.
Speaker 2: That's what my father tells me almost everyday.
Speaker 1: Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I'll let him know.
Speaker 1: No. I just like looking at wedding rings, Ok?
Speaker 2: Women are such dreamers.
Speaker 1: These are specially designed for the year 2000!
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it, Just drive. Oh, No, The light is about to change... Step on it!
Speaker 2: Are you nuts! I'm not going to run a red light!
Speaker 1: Whatever. Just turn right here.... The freeway will be packed at this hour.... Let's take a side street. Go on! Get out of our way! Move, Move!
Speaker 2: What's your problem! Geez. Having a fit is not going to help!
Speaker 1: Here, I know a short cut... Just go down here, And we'll cut though Ashburn Heights. Let's go, Let's go! Watch out for that lady!
Speaker 2: I'm going as fast as I can!
Speaker 1: Yes! We made it. 5:58, Just before the library closes.
Speaker 2: You're such a geek!
Speaker 1: Oh, No, France isn't an island. It is located in the western part of the European continent. But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts. Does Japan have good harbors?
Speaker 2: Good harbors! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world, And Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world. Also, There are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands. France isn't very mountainous, Is it?
Speaker 1: No, France isn't very mountainous. But it does contain the Pyrenees, A large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons. What kind of Climate does Japan have?
Speaker 2: The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south, Mild in the central part and cold in the north. Except for Hokkaido, We don't get much snowfall at all. France has a mild climate, Doesn't it?
Speaker 1: Yes, The climate of France rarely has severe winters. In southern France, One can live in comfort the whole year. Is Japan good for farming?
Speaker 2: Yes, Japan is good for farming. Rice is the main crop, But Japan is also an industrial center. Fishing is very important, Too. Rice isn't grown in France, Is it?
Speaker 1: No, Rice isn't grown in France. But farming, Fishing and industry are also very important in France. I'd like to go to Japan some day. Would you like to visit France?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'd like to visit France. I'd like to travel all over the world. As you describe it, France seems to be very much like Japan. I would like to see it for myself.
Speaker 1: I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's so nice of you to comfort me.
Speaker 1: Ok. Hurry up.
Speaker 1: Why? You seem pretty sure about it.
Speaker 2: Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life.
Speaker 1: But IQ is decided at birth. One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it.
Speaker 2: That's why people's achievement varies greatly.
Speaker 1: That's true, But what if one comes across some difficulties. He must rely on his EQ to deal with them.
Speaker 2: Yes, Jerry, Can you share your understanding of EQ?
Speaker 1: I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives.
Speaker 2: Quite right. Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success?
Speaker 1: Just as Forrest?
Speaker 2: Yes, His IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ.
Speaker 1: I got it.
Speaker 1: Well, It won't if there no line at the pump.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not quite ready.
Speaker 1: I'll give you five more minutes, Then I'm going on without you!
Speaker 2: You wouldn't do a thing like that!
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes, I would!
Speaker 1: I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.
Speaker 2: You see, That's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.
Speaker 1: Next time, Go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.
Speaker 2: Well he's more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories.
Speaker 1: Love stories? More like one-night-stands.
Speaker 2: Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, Drunk friends of yours ; they're no saints.
Speaker 1: My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?
Speaker 2: You're unbearable ; you can walk home, I'm leaving.
Speaker 1: It's not easy, Particularly with listening and speaking, Because sometimes the connection isn't too good.
Speaker 2: I bet you find the character difficult to write!
Speaker 1: Actually, Many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, So they're easy for me.
Speaker 2: So, You can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, Right?
Speaker 1: Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?
Speaker 2: In a way, It's similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself.
Speaker 1: You know you didn't.
Speaker 2: Well, I am telling you now.
Speaker 1: Yes, But you might have told me before.
Speaker 2: I didn't think you would be interested.
Speaker 1: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her?
Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.
Speaker 1: Oh, You men! You are all the same.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So did you do anything else?
Speaker 2: Well, We went to a dance club.
Speaker 1: Did you have fun there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, We had a great time. And we're going to go there again next week!
Speaker 1: How can you finance your education abroad? It is very expensive to study abroad.
Speaker 2: I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad. Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams. If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough, I may get a scholarship.
Speaker 1: It could be pretty tough studying abroad. Being so far away from home...
Speaker 1: 3. 5 dollars each.
Speaker 1: We should come here more often.
Speaker 2: You are absolutely right.
Speaker 1: I'd like to come back next weekend.
Speaker 1: Sure. Oh, That reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?
Speaker 2: My boots? Er... Sure, Ok.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you for telling me a little more about it.
Speaker 1: The lyrics of the new song are beautiful, Too. Can you sing?
Speaker 2: Sure. I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now.
Speaker 1: Let's go buy their new album. Want to come with me?
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Is there a good time for you to help me?
Speaker 2: If we work on this tomorrow night, You could easily be ready by Friday.
Speaker 1: How about meeting in my office?
Speaker 2: That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have.
Speaker 1: Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!
Speaker 1: Oh, How did you deal with it?
Speaker 2: I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's a pity. What was the matter?
Speaker 2: Simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. In their culture women should put family first.
Speaker 2: Yes, He said it would be better for me and for the whole family. But I simply can not quit working.
Speaker 1: So that's why it's hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner.
Speaker 2: Not really. There are many successful mixed marriage around us.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Of course. This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice.
Speaker 2: Is there a prize?
Speaker 1: I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio.
Speaker 2: Do you think you have a chance?
Speaker 1: A chance? Not just a chance, I'm a hundred percent certain. Everyone says my voice is beautiful.
Speaker 2: But you haven't practised all that much.
Speaker 1: I still have 5 days to practise. It's in the bag!
Speaker 2: Don't be too sure. You're still going to need some help.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maybe.
Speaker 1: I hope so. Let me know how many will come. Then I will book the restaurant.
Speaker 1: Oh, Today's International Labour Day. Is it our working day?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: And don't forget your fishing tackle.
Speaker 2: Ok. I like fishing very much.
Speaker 1: She is the cheer-leader. They are required to put on a performance. Look! Here they come.
Speaker 2: Oh, Look at her. She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA.
Speaker 1: I want to be like her.
Speaker 2: Get real. Don't be so pathetic.
Speaker 1: Hey, Young man! I'm yoursis. Don't talk to me like that.
Speaker 2: Oh, Man, Look at her, Go! She is amazing! She should be mysis.
Speaker 1: Boy, You've got such a crush on her, Haven't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I want to be her boyfriend. Just like in the movie.
Speaker 1: Are you out of your mind?
Speaker 2: She told me she liked my new haircut. She thought it was cool.
Speaker 1: Go ahead, Have a try and be a joke.
Speaker 1: I wish he could too.
Speaker 2: How's your boy, Jack?
Speaker 1: He's a bit tired, You know. It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up.
Speaker 2: Poor boys! They work harder at school nowadays, Don't they?
Speaker 1: Good luck to them.
Speaker 1: There will be a refund when I return the card, Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, If the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches.
Speaker 1: Ok, Here you are.
Speaker 1: There's a story about breakdancing in the paper.
Speaker 2: What does it say?
Speaker 1: According to the story, It's some sort of modern dance style.
Speaker 2: Like disco?
Speaker 1: Well, Breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance.
Speaker 2: And disco a kind of nightclub.
Speaker 1: Right, A disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music...
Speaker 2: So... Disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it. And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether.
Speaker 1: You are witty.
Speaker 1: We will need it for both days.
Speaker 2: We will need to know who will be driving the van.
Speaker 1: The van will be driven by Mary and me.
Speaker 2: It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, No problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom.
Speaker 2: Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, Her poster, A CD...
Speaker 2: So you're a big fan, Eh?
Speaker 1: Not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer, Too.
Speaker 2: And she was in a movie once again, Right?
Speaker 1: Yes, Though I don't think her acting skills are that great.
Speaker 2: What was your impression of her when you saw her in person?
Speaker 1: She looked sweeter than her pictures.
Speaker 2: Did you take a photo with her?
Speaker 1: No, There were too many people. When she got out of the car, Her fans were all screaming, Trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs.
Speaker 2: Crazy!
Speaker 1: That's my business, Not yours.
Speaker 2: True enough, Until the time comes that you need to take my money. I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important.
Speaker 1: So how do you survive from pay day to pay day?
Speaker 2: I don't just survive. I put money away as well. I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go, And I stick to my plan. If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises.
Speaker 1: I'm not disciplined enough I guess.
Speaker 2: In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies. I think you need toreevaluate your spending habits.
Speaker 1: How would you do that?
Speaker 2: I think we should do a few things at once. Improving public transport would encourage people to use that. If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre, They won't use their cars as much.
Speaker 1: I don't know. I think it's unfair to make drivers pay more money. They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax, For example.
Speaker 2: I think that they should pay more tax. Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people's health by discharging all those exhaust fumes.
Speaker 1: The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city. The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom. It well be unpopular.
Speaker 2: That's a good point. Car owners will probably be against it, But people who use public transport will be in favor of it.
Speaker 1: What school did you come from?
Speaker 2: I transferred from PCC.
Speaker 1: Why'd you transfer here?
Speaker 2: I wanted to attend this school originally, But my grades out of high school weren't good enough.
Speaker 1: Is PCC a good school?
Speaker 2: PCC is great!
Speaker 1: I hope you enjoy it here.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: I am so happy for them.
Speaker 2: Are you crying?
Speaker 1: Yes, I always cry at weddings.
Speaker 2: Harris and Anne are perfect for each other.
Speaker 1: Yes, They are.
Speaker 2: You and Tom also make a great couple.
Speaker 1: In fact, We are beginning to make preparations.
Speaker 2: For the wedding?
Speaker 1: No, No, For the engagement.
Speaker 2: Try to catch this bouquet then.
Speaker 1: I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last.
Speaker 2: Yeah, That's nice.
Speaker 1: Hmm, I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home.
Speaker 2: A plant? That's creative. I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you. But there is a problem. Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs?
Speaker 1: I hope so. I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase. I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border.
Speaker 2: I don't know. I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer. You don't want to get her in trouble.
Speaker 1: Tom and Bill Smith. They are both working now you know? And they've bought a new house.
Speaker 2: Oh, They have? I didn't know. I haven't seen Tom lately.
Speaker 1: It's out in the suburbs.
Speaker 2: Have you seen the house?
Speaker 1: Yes, I have. I went out with them last weekend.
Speaker 2: Is it nice?
Speaker 1: Yes, It is. There are three bedrooms, A living room, A dining room, And a big kitchen. There's also a garden.
Speaker 2: Well, That does sound nice. Have they moved in yet?
Speaker 1: They are moving today. Tom's taken the day off. He's rented a truck, And they should have all their furniture in the house tonight.
Speaker 2: When are they going to have the party?
Speaker 1: Next Saturday night. You should get your invitation today or tomorrow.
Speaker 2: Wow, That would be something to look forward to.
Speaker 1: Sure it is. Is it convenient to get there by plane?
Speaker 2: Well, The airport is quite far from the downtown area, But it is still more convenient than taking the train.
Speaker 1: Sounds very interesting. I can't wait to go there.
Speaker 2: Wow! It is huge and you can do many activities here.
Speaker 1: That is true. Some people go camping, Some people pick fresh fruit, Some people go boating and some people go grass skiing.
Speaker 2: I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm.
Speaker 1: Well, Now you know. Let's go to the lake over there. Some people are fishing over there. I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake, I really want to try.
Speaker 2: I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first.
Speaker 1: Yes. We can get what we need at the stands right by the lake. Who do you think will catch a big fish first?
Speaker 2: Of course. I will.
Speaker 1: Wait and see. I want to try horseback riding after fishing. It looks very exciting and fun.
Speaker 2: It is. However, You will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider.
Speaker 1: No problem. It is always worth trying something new once in your life time.
Speaker 1: Was it his first offence?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately not. He was charged with a DUI when he was in university.
Speaker 1: What happened to him then?
Speaker 2: Not much ; it was a minor offence back then. He got away with a fine of $ 500.
Speaker 1: Did they take his license away?
Speaker 2: No, They were really easy on him. The problem is that that was a long time ago. They are much tougher on crime now.
Speaker 1: What do you think will happen to him?
Speaker 2: Well, He'll definitely lose his license, Pay a fine, And maybe even spend some time in jail.
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound too promising. Does he have a defence lawyer?
Speaker 2: Not yet. If we can't find a lawyer for him, Then the state will appoint him with one.
Speaker 1: My sister is a lawyer. I can ask her if she can help him.
Speaker 2: That'd be great! I know he'd appreciate your help.
Speaker 1: Certainly. What time will you come back?
Speaker 2: At seven, Please.
Speaker 1: How many in your party?
Speaker 2: A party of three.
Speaker 1: All right. We are waiting for you at seven.
Speaker 1: Great! I'll sing, And you can dance in our band.
Speaker 1: What kind of volunteer work?
Speaker 2: I help out at the children's hospital. I help plan activities.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's exciting. This month we're doing crossword puzzles.
Speaker 1: She's your sister. What she asked was only duck soup for you. Why can't you be good to her?
Speaker 2: But I am her brother, Not her servant.
Speaker 1: Sorry isn't good enough! What can you do to help me?
Speaker 2: I understand why you're angry, Mrs. Wilson, And believe me, We are doing everything in our power to work this out.
Speaker 1: Well, Obviously, What you're doing is not good enough!
Speaker 2: If you could just give us a few more days, We should be able to get this straightened out.
Speaker 1: Then...
Speaker 2: If the aid is available, They will give you two or more application forms, One is for admission, The others are for the aid.
Speaker 1: What if not?
Speaker 2: They will tell you the aid is impossible.
Speaker 1: I see. Anything else?
Speaker 2: Yes, We ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine.
Speaker 1: Well, It sounds like you really enjoyed yourself.
Speaker 1: Are you used to the climate here?
Speaker 2: I think I'll soon get used to it.
Speaker 1: What is the average temperature of Beijing?
Speaker 2: Lt's about 180C, But in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero. And we have a long winter.
Speaker 1: Which season do you like best?
Speaker 2: I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice.
Speaker 1: Yes. Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life? The job doesn't stop when we graduate.
Speaker 2: Really? What is there to do after we graduate?
Speaker 1: Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president.
Speaker 2: I'm honored that you think I would be qualified. But I would really have to think about this first.
Speaker 1: What do they do?
Speaker 2: People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead.
Speaker 1: It was that final sprint! You were great! Really!
Speaker 2: Do you really think so? I mean, Was I? Er... You... Must be disappointed.
Speaker 1: I know. You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, A big school or a small school, A public or private school...
Speaker 2: Yup, You understand. And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college. They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline. And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low.
Speaker 1: I see. Well, Don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school. He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction. He gave me some information, And next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended.
Speaker 2: Thanks for the information. And good luck in your college search.
Speaker 1: Which is better?
Speaker 2: One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers.
Speaker 1: I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sometimes.
Speaker 1: I've made arrangements with a friend to help me.
Speaker 2: You know that I only allow one absence per semester, Don't you?
Speaker 1: Yes, I know.
Speaker 2: Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me.
Speaker 1: Ok, I can do that.
Speaker 2: Well, Have a good day off from class.
Speaker 1: But you're OK? It was nothing serious, Was it?
Speaker 2: You ladies look very elegant in black. But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come...
Speaker 1: I know what you mean. However, There are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, Then it's the natural disasters, Deforestation, Or the greenhouse effect.
Speaker 2: What is the greenhouse effect exactly?
Speaker 1: It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature.
Speaker 2: I see, So it's similar to global warming?
Speaker 1: They're related to one another, Yes.
Speaker 2: I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.
Speaker 1: People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, But it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well.
Speaker 2: People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations.
Speaker 1: I think if everyone pitches in, The world will be a better place.
Speaker 1: No, Listen to me. Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well. Maybe in other people's eyes, I want you to be my girl-friend. But... But...
Speaker 2: But you have had lily already? You should have told me about her, But you didn't.
Speaker 1: Ok... Ok... Anyway. I will treat you as my best friend. I hope you can do the same.
Speaker 2: Leave me! Go away!
Speaker 1: Yeah, How about your maths teacher?
Speaker 2: He's an old antique, Very serious.
Speaker 1: Bad luck, Anne.
Speaker 2: Hey! How about your history teacher?
Speaker 1: She's another antique.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, That's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding.
Speaker 2: Sounds like an interesting film. Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday.
Speaker 1: Okay, See you then.
Speaker 1: Are you sure? I don't want to inconvenience you.
Speaker 2: No problem. I'd be happy to.
Speaker 1: Thanks. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much.
Speaker 1: It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time.
Speaker 2: I can understand the problem with that.
Speaker 1: Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?
Speaker 2: No problem, Do you want those classes still?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do.
Speaker 2: Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Are the reports favorable?
Speaker 2: Generally, The reporters take positive lines. They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of, But there's nothing worrying in the reports. In the classifieds, One of our competitors is a.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. They must be thinking of moving into that market. Are there any interesting editorials?
Speaker 2: Not really. They all seem to focus on the election. There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week.
Speaker 1: I'm not surprised. That article certainly added fuel to the debate. Ok. Thanks. Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me? I'd like to read them.
Speaker 2: Sure. There you are.
Speaker 1: I was in such a panic at that time. Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning.
Speaker 1: Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!
Speaker 2: Of course you can call the police if you want. That's not what I mean. I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything.
Speaker 1: I suppose. What can they do? I don't even know who he is.
Speaker 2: Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much. Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out. If you see him a third time, And if he follows you again, Then I think we should go to the police. But for now, Just try not to worry.
Speaker 1: Alright. And I won't go to that cafe for awhile.
Speaker 1: Well. I like the Thorn Birds best.
Speaker 2: Is it very interesting?
Speaker 1: Sure. I like the writer's language, Too.
Speaker 2: If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book.
Speaker 1: Would you like to go to the bookshop with me?
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Let's go!
Speaker 1: Apparently, You have unpaid late fees.
Speaker 2: I do?
Speaker 1: You owe some money.
Speaker 2: Exactly how much do I owe?
Speaker 1: You owe $ 24. 50.
Speaker 2: I won't be able to pay that right now.
Speaker 1: Until you pay it, You can't check out books.
Speaker 2: I will pay it. Don't worry.
Speaker 1: Everything is so new to me. I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there.
Speaker 2: Sure, Very difficult.
Speaker 1: I am very grateful for your advice.
Speaker 2: It's my pleasure to talk with you.
Speaker 1: You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota? That's not true at all, You're really a smart guy.
Speaker 2: I know that, But some people don't think like that. And I get problems from teachers as well.
Speaker 1: Teachers? I didn't think that they would be racist at all.
Speaker 2: Racist? Not exactly. It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic, As if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject. Suddenly I become the representative of the black race, As if we all had the same opinion.
Speaker 1: I see. It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US.
Speaker 1: It's in the C building.
Speaker 2: Oh, I know exactly where that is.
Speaker 1: Do you think you can tell me where it is?
Speaker 2: Sure, What room number is it?
Speaker 1: It's room number 261.
Speaker 2: I have a class around there right now.
Speaker 1: Could you show me where it is?
Speaker 2: No problem, Come on.
Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more. Actually, I'm a Beijing Opera fan.
Speaker 2: Really? Good for you.
Speaker 1: Let's see. He has a roman nose, Bushy eyebrows and dimples!
Speaker 2: Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, Sunken eyes and a mole on her chin!
Speaker 1: Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! Ok, My turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, He is also bald!
Speaker 2: Your future husband!
Speaker 1: Not funny.
Speaker 1: Julie, Do you know who that woman is over there by the window?
Speaker 2: That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee.
Speaker 1: I thought that he was with Malia.
Speaker 2: Oh, That relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday.
Speaker 1: I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!
Speaker 2: Actually, He was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well.
Speaker 1: Why? What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, He made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, My manager blamed them on me!
Speaker 1: That's not very fair. What did you do?
Speaker 2: There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, He would have fired for me for sure.
Speaker 1: Does he treat everyone in your department like this?
Speaker 2: He treats everyone pretty poorly, But the way he treats me really takes the cake!
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others?
Speaker 2: I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair!
Speaker 1: Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company?
Speaker 2: Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion.
Speaker 1: That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders.
Speaker 2: I try to be sensible about it, But it's not very easy. Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it.
Speaker 1: That's so true. When you have a taste for success, You can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way.
Speaker 1: What else can you speak?
Speaker 2: Well, I know a little Italian.
Speaker 1: Well, I hear David have been fired.
Speaker 2: Oh, That is a shame. He is really hard working.
Speaker 1: But the private school amount to better schools.
Speaker 1: Do you think I am rich enough to make it? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment, I can move in at once.
Speaker 2: If sounds so tempting. Why not go applying for a loan from the bank? They charge very low interest, So you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years.
Speaker 1: I'm most grateful. Everyone in our class enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: I'm glad.
Speaker 1: Would you mind my keeping it for another week?
Speaker 1: It's so spacious, About 40 square metres, Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, About 46 square metres.
Speaker 1: Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Very beautiful and very interesting. But why do you hang them in the tree?
Speaker 2: They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them, So they hung them in the tree. Then in winter, They can peel corn ears in their leisure time.
Speaker 1: Very good idea. Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness.
Speaker 1: You mean you haven't seen her before? Then, How could she be your girlfriend? Maybe you don't even know her.
Speaker 2: That's true. But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now. Actually we are on an intimate level. We even plan to be engaged next month.
Speaker 1: Congratulations! It's good to follow your heart. But I just didn't expect to be so fast.
Speaker 2: The Internet is making interaction much faster. People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way.
Speaker 1: Probably you're right.
Speaker 1: And stay in the shallow area. I don't want to see you go any farther than that sandbar! It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floatier.
Speaker 2: You're back already? The water was too cold, Huh? I'll tell you a secret. Do you see that small pool of water over there? It'll be warmer in there. Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.
Speaker 1: What is that? A jellyfish? Jeremy, Put that down right now! It could sting you!
Speaker 2: Ah! Not on me! Ow!
Speaker 1: I called you yesterday. Did you get my message?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was taking a shower when you called. I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, But I think your phone was off.
Speaker 1: No problem. I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week. You're still coming to the wedding with me, Right?
Speaker 2: Oh, Is that next week?
Speaker 1: Yes. Did you forget?
Speaker 2: No, Of course not. I already bought them a present.
Speaker 1: That's good. I want to invite Megan also. Next time you see her, Can you tell her for me.
Speaker 2: Sure. Does she know your friend?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that. I'm not exactly sure how they know each other.
Speaker 2: Are we all going to drive together?
Speaker 1: Yes. I'll pick you up first, And then we'll go get Megan.
Speaker 1: But it seems like a good idea. All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter. After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money.
Speaker 2: Sounds like a pyramid scheme. Have you heard of those before?
Speaker 1: Pyramid scheme? What is that?
Speaker 2: It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy, Like a pyramid. The person at the top asks the people below him for money, And then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him.
Speaker 1: Sounds good to me. The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him.
Speaker 2: Not exactly. The scam keeps on going, With the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom.
Speaker 1: What happens then?
Speaker 2: Nothing. The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them, And they get nothing. They end up losing. That's why it's a scam.
Speaker 1: I see. I guess I should be more careful about what I read, Especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got everything from rock n 'roll to the latest new - wave stuff.
Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I'm strictly into classical music. You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart, Do you?
Speaker 1: Sorry, My taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960's. Music written before then is just history to me.
Speaker 2: Well, Speaking of history, Let's get back to the books. We'Ve got an exam tomorrow, Remember?
Speaker 1: Does 6, 30 suit you?
Speaker 2: It suits us fine. We'll see you then.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Goodbye.
Speaker 1: Yes, You are right.
Speaker 2: What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot.
Speaker 1: Yes, That would work out better.
Speaker 2: You know, Maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone.
Speaker 1: Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.
Speaker 2: Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!
Speaker 1: It appears that you have late fees.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yes, Really.
Speaker 2: How much do I owe?
Speaker 1: You owe $ 24. 50 in late fees.
Speaker 2: I don't have that much today.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, But until you pay it, You won't be able to check out any more books.
Speaker 2: I'll pay it as soon as possible.
Speaker 1: Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'd forgotten about it.
Speaker 1: Forgotten about it? How could you?
Speaker 2: Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Speaker 2: It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian.
Speaker 1: I guess so. So what do you do around this time of year?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll celebrate Hanukah soon, But that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you. Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break.
Speaker 1: Well, Would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house?
Speaker 2: Not at all. A party is a party. I'll be happy to come.
Speaker 1: It's the marketing's fault, I suppose. What do you want to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I want to become just like Bruce Lee. What should I do?
Speaker 1: That's a long way to go, I'm afraid. First of all, You gotta grow up.
Speaker 2: I am still young. And I'm growing every minute.
Speaker 1: Sure. Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope.
Speaker 2: I love running. Anything else?
Speaker 1: Please change your clothes first!
Speaker 2: I'm perfect with my clothes. And I do not have anything else with me.
Speaker 1: Sorry, But no jeans here.
Speaker 2: Oh, That's the only place where jeans are not popular. I'd better just go home.
Speaker 1: There will be an information session about the Students 'Union this Tuesday. You can apply for it then.
Speaker 2: Ok, Thank you.
Speaker 1: Really, She's so pretty.
Speaker 1: Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.
Speaker 2: I think most people do. I like wearing nice, Colorful clothes in summer, You know, A nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter.
Speaker 1: Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze!
Speaker 2: Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year?
Speaker 1: Thanks to global warming, It could be hotter than ever!
Speaker 1: My roommate's having a party.
Speaker 1: And how long does the course last?
Speaker 2: It lasts for 9 months.
Speaker 1: When does it start?
Speaker 2: The next beginning class starts on October 25th.
Speaker 1: What time is the class?
Speaker 2: From 7 to 9 o'clock.
Speaker 1: How much does it cost?
Speaker 2: It costs 125 dollars a month.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's all right. I want to enroll in the course.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Please fill out this form for us.
Speaker 1: Do you want me to fill it out now?
Speaker 2: Yes, Please. We need a record of you education and your work experiences.
Speaker 1: It would probably be very expensive.
Speaker 2: I think the government can afford it. Besides, There are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i.
Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don't seem to have enough money to educate kids properly.
Speaker 2: If we are to invest more money to education, We will need to raise taxes. That wouldn't be popular with voters.
Speaker 1: Most voters what everything both ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, But without increasing taxes.
Speaker 2: The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.
Speaker 1: Yes. The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly.
Speaker 1: And not expensive either.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't care about that.
Speaker 1: Everybody is buying them.
Speaker 2: Are they?
Speaker 1: Yes, They are very fashionable, You see.
Speaker 2: I am afraid I am not interested in fashion.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But thank you very much all the same.
Speaker 1: Sorry I couldn't help you.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. We must have misunderstood each other.
Speaker 2: Why don't you try to be clearer about your intentions?
Speaker 1: You're right. I am sorry. Let's go and watch the movie.
Speaker 2: It's okay. I don't want to go now. We'Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie. I don't want to see a movie without watching the beginning.
Speaker 1: It's just one exam. Can youre-take the exam?
Speaker 2: Yes, But it's so humiliating! I don't want my friends to know I failed!
Speaker 1: Why didn't you do a good job?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I sat down in my seat, Looked at my paper, And then my mind just went totally blank.
Speaker 1: Do you think you studied enough for the exam?
Speaker 2: No...
Speaker 1: What did you do last night?
Speaker 2: I watched TV.
Speaker 1: Did you study at all last night for your exam?
Speaker 2: No, Not really.
Speaker 1: I am sure if you had studied, You would have done well. When can youre-take your exam?
Speaker 2: Tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Alright. Get out your books and I'll help you prepare.
Speaker 1: Someone you're living with.
Speaker 2: What? Not my Dad, I hope!?
Speaker 1: Come on, Mary, It's your brother, Jack.
Speaker 2: No kidding! Jack is such a log! He's never dated a girl.
Speaker 1: The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him.
Speaker 2: And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls. He's putting his heart into his stamp collection.
Speaker 1: Well, If you want to help your friend, You should do something about it.
Speaker 1: Hey, It's not that bad. The food is nutritious and it's really convenient. I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff.
Speaker 2: Eating is important. You are what you eat. It's not only a daily routine.
Speaker 1: Well, Will you just go back to work after lunch?
Speaker 2: No. I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch.
Speaker 1: But you didn't eat anything today.
Speaker 2: Well, The bill is paid by month. That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant.
Speaker 1: All right. I'm going to the McDonald's.
Speaker 2: For what? I thought you didn't like western food.
Speaker 1: No, I never did. It's for my son. He loves it, And I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week.
Speaker 2: That's really smart. My son Daniel is the same with your son. I just don't get it, Why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food.
Speaker 1: Me, Either. But, It's for sure that the children market is a really big one.
Speaker 2: That's for sure. It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children.
Speaker 1: Is that all?
Speaker 2: That's all.
Speaker 1: May I see your library card, Please?
Speaker 2: It's right here.
Speaker 1: Will that be all for today?
Speaker 2: Yes. That's it.
Speaker 1: These are due back in two weeks.
Speaker 2: All right. Have a good night.
Speaker 1: In my country, Many people enjoy golf, But it is too expensive for some people. A few people like extreme sports, But I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them.
Speaker 2: Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people. Several people from my university enjoy them, But most of us just watch. No one I know plays golf.
Speaker 1: I know loads of people who play it regularly. There are plenty of golf courses around the country. In the past, Only a tiny number of people played.
Speaker 2: A great deal of people follow rugby in my country.
Speaker 1: There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too.
Speaker 1: Goodbye. Hope to see you again next year.
Speaker 1: Will it snow today?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Do you like snowing?
Speaker 1: Yes, When it snows, Every where is white. It's very beautiful.
Speaker 2: You can read the newspaper. Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not.
Speaker 1: Good idea.
Speaker 1: Is it just a bus?
Speaker 2: Oh. No. The motor coach is air-conditioned, There is a galley for food preparation, Movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need.
Speaker 1: Wow! That sounds like pure luxury.
Speaker 1: Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday?
Speaker 2: Yes, Just like Christmas in western countries, It is a time for eating lots of special food.
Speaker 1: Yes, Yes. She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby.
Speaker 2: Oh, She is going to be a great mother.
Speaker 1: I am. What's more, His wife is 84.
Speaker 2: Is she really?
Speaker 1: Yes, She is. And guess what, He is her sixth husband.
Speaker 2: Really? Quite a woman, Isn't she?
Speaker 1: Yeah I know what you mean. That's why this year I am keeping things more simple. Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time, Or doing some volunteering work.
Speaker 2: That seems reasonable. We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.
Speaker 1: Sure, As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight!
Speaker 2: Well, We can't break tradition! It's bad luck!
Speaker 1: Wow, You're not kidding. Hold on a second. Hello, Could you give us a hand, Please?
Speaker 1: He's doing well. We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah?
Speaker 1: Well, We were talking and catching up on what we'Ve been doing, Talking about work and family, When all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it! He started freaking out, And screaming...
Speaker 2: Ha ha, Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, And the funniest thing was, That he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl. You had to be there! Everyone was staring and laughing... It was hilarious!
Speaker 1: Ok. Boy, This looks expensive.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It costed a bundle alright.
Speaker 1: Wow, This's sinking a hole.
Speaker 2: Yeah, This sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned.
Speaker 1: I believe it. Hoo, This car corners like it's on rails.
Speaker 2: We are on the high way. I'm the * *.
Speaker 1: Wow, This car can really burn rubber.
Speaker 2: It's a great feeling.
Speaker 1: You made a perfect choice, Jack.
Speaker 2: Thanks, Daisy.
Speaker 1: No. That's incomplete.
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: What's your mailing address?
Speaker 2: 456 Cherry Drive, Pasadena, Ca 91170.
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: So what's the problem?
Speaker 1: Bulldog 123 is just the street. You have to give me the city, State, And ZIP code.
Speaker 2: Oh, I get it. My email address is bluedog123@yahoo. Com.
Speaker 1: I have two classes on here that are at the same time.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Can you change that for me?
Speaker 2: Do you still want both classes?
Speaker 1: Yes, I would like to keep both classes.
Speaker 2: I'll try to change one to a different day.
Speaker 1: I would greatly appreciate that.
Speaker 1: That's one reason I'd like to try it. I'd really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office.
Speaker 2: You'd need a lot of training before becoming a farmer. It's not something you can just walk into.
Speaker 1: My uncle owns a farm and I'Ve spent some time working with him. I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields.
Speaker 2: Well, I ‘d certainly come and visit you. It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm. I'd love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while.
Speaker 1: Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry.
Speaker 2: Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, But as far as I know, Most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour.
Speaker 2: Really? What do the companies do that for?
Speaker 1: I believe most of them think of it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Do we need an appointment beforehand?
Speaker 1: I'll call the tourist information centre to check.
Speaker 1: Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins. We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines. We can judge it with naked eyes.
Speaker 2: I see. By the way, China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history. Did they issue their own coins in China?
Speaker 1: Certainly, They did. Liao Coins and Song Coins, For example, Coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago. The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style, Just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe. Let me look for one and show you.
Speaker 2: If you happen to find one, Please bargain with the owner for it. I'd like to have one. It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal.
Speaker 1: But we need the wood.
Speaker 2: But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood.
Speaker 1: It's a problem, Because my boss is in that shop now.
Speaker 2: Ok, I will go there myself.
Speaker 1: Sorry, Mr. Polly.
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter. Oh, God, I have only four dollars in my wallet. Is that possible for me to buy one?
Speaker 1: Have a try.
Speaker 1: Do you shave every morning?
Speaker 2: I shave every workday, But I only shave at weekends if I'm going out somewhere. If I'm staying at home, I don't shave.
Speaker 1: Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend?
Speaker 2: Yes. I brush my teeth in the morning, Just before I go to work. It's actually the last thing I do before leaving. Then I brush again before bed.
Speaker 1: Your dentist must be proud of you!
Speaker 1: Frankly yes. We like to employ married people. By the way, Do you have any children?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a three-year-old son.
Speaker 1: No. Can I have my money back?
Speaker 2: Hmm... Have you got a receipt?
Speaker 1: A receipt?
Speaker 2: Yes. I must see your receipt. You can't have your money back without receipt.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not certain, But I think I've lost it.
Speaker 1: Okay. I won't hold you up then.
Speaker 2: Right. I'll see you later.
Speaker 1: See you later.
Speaker 1: What we really should be making investment in is the Euro. I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter, I think it's about time to buy in.
Speaker 2: What about the Yen?
Speaker 1: Are you kidding? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar!
Speaker 1: That is a really interesting fact.
Speaker 2: I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach.
Speaker 1: Just do whatever you feel like doing.
Speaker 2: ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy. Let's put the stuff under the tree.
Speaker 1: Good idea. It is always cooler in a shade.
Speaker 2: I can't wait to play in the water. My feet are burning when I stand on the sand.
Speaker 1: I must catch the nine-thirty Train.
Speaker 2: It's plenty of time yet. The railway station is very close. It won't take your twenty minutes to get there.
Speaker 1: I might try it myself.
Speaker 1: The weather is so warm for December, Don't you think?
Speaker 2: It is unusually warm. I blame it on global warming.
Speaker 1: Global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere.
Speaker 2: So sure. Are you from around here?
Speaker 1: No. I'm new here. I just moved here a few months ago.
Speaker 2: Where are you from?
Speaker 1: I'm from China. What about you?
Speaker 2: I am from Texas. I was in China once, But it was a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy it?
Speaker 2: I did. I especially liked the food. What do you think about the food here?
Speaker 1: It's very different from Chinese food, But I am getting used to it.
Speaker 2: Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there?
Speaker 1: Yes, Have you read it?
Speaker 2: No, But I saw the movie. What do you think about it?
Speaker 1: Well, To be honest, I've only gotten though 10 pages of it. So far, Though, It's interesting.
Speaker 2: Well, This is my stop. It was nice talking with you.
Speaker 1: Likewise. Bye!
Speaker 1: This machine is out of order.
Speaker 2: You shouldn't have used the machine. Did you lose your money?
Speaker 1: I sure did.
Speaker 2: You ought to complain. These machine are always out of order.
Speaker 1: Ok. It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh.
Speaker 2: ( After they entering the park ) Great, It's so quiet here. We have the park to ourselves, Only you and me.
Speaker 1: Are you kidding? Don't you see many people over there? Just on your right.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see them. Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people.
Speaker 1: Ah, You changed so fast.
Speaker 1: What about the party?
Speaker 2: It was boring. The music was too slow and the food was lousy and, Above all, I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time.
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay?
Speaker 2: I left after the opening dance. I couldn't wait to get out of there.
Speaker 1: I know. But it is my lucky charm. I carry it all the time.
Speaker 2: Suit yourself. Don't forget to set the alarm clock.
Speaker 1: Yeah... Me, Too.
Speaker 2: Well, Except fishing. To be honest, I hate fishing, But I love all the others.
Speaker 1: Hey! Look at this! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach.
Speaker 2: You know. I really don't those big hotels.
Speaker 1: Neither do I. Let's stay in a cabin. It'll be much nicer right beside the ocean.
Speaker 1: Of course, Bamboo!
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship.
Speaker 2: You sound quite knowledgeable.
Speaker 1: Not really, Panda is my favorite animal.
Speaker 2: Actually, It likes milk too.
Speaker 1: Any way, In a word, Panda is our friend.
Speaker 2: Do you know other famous animals in the world?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Let me think, The kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous.
Speaker 2: That's right. Ok, Let's move on.
Speaker 1: I do. And now I'm working hard to learn English, And I want to be an interpreter some day.
Speaker 2: You're promising. Just follow your dream and never give up.
Speaker 1: Thanks, I will.
Speaker 1: Come on. She's like that with everyone.
Speaker 2: I don't think so actually. She never even says \"hello\" to me.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. All things are difficult before they are easy.
Speaker 2: You hit the nail right on the head.
Speaker 1: Well, Are you invested in some language-exchange program?
Speaker 2: What is it?
Speaker 1: It's where I teach you Chinese, And in exchange you teach me English.
Speaker 2: Awesome. I've been giving this a lot of thought. When can we do this?
Speaker 1: How about this sunday?
Speaker 2: Ok, Cool.
Speaker 1: Good. I'll give you a call tonight.
Speaker 1: What do you do, Susan?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a college student. How about you?
Speaker 1: I work for the Bank of China, In the International Section.
Speaker 1: Then which will be your first choice?
Speaker 2: I don't know. How about you? Are you staying here or somewhere.
Speaker 1: I have decided to go toTasha.
Speaker 2: By train or by plane?
Speaker 1: By plane.
Speaker 1: Ac Milan versus Real Madrid.
Speaker 2: That will be a tough match, Right?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: What are we waiting for? It's already 7 pm now. Let's buy some drinks and desserts now.
Speaker 1: Great idea! Here we go!
Speaker 1: Man, What a freeloader. You better do something quick or he'll never hit the road. After all, He's got it made in the shade here.
Speaker 2: You think he might stay even longer?!
Speaker 1: Now, Don't go losing your temper. If you tolerated all you can, Just kick him out... But do it with gloves. I know! Tell him a white lie like you're getting the house fumigated!
Speaker 2: That wouldn't be a lie!
Speaker 1: Don't be such a chicken! Whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie.
Speaker 1: That's what I want to say.
Speaker 1: You are absolutely right. They are too brief. They don't tell you anything.
Speaker 1: You were lucky to find it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, But scented tea is now in fashion.
Speaker 1: I don't think she will do such a thing.
Speaker 2: But she did and made me disappointed.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up. A girlfriend is not everything.
Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.
Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you answer my question?
Speaker 2: What question?
Speaker 1: Do you love me? Come on, I'm eager to hear.
Speaker 2: You know that I care for you. I---I'm proud of you.
Speaker 1: Don't cherish your words, Dear.
Speaker 2: I---I don't feel like saying it.
Speaker 1: Yes, We offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects.
Speaker 2: How do I sign up?
Speaker 1: If you give me your address, I can mail you an information packet and the application forms.
Speaker 2: Great!
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm really weak in maps, I did poorly in high school.
Speaker 2: That's a problem.
Speaker 1: After you have your great idea, Then you can set up shop by registering a domain name, Creating a website, An email address, And a hosting service. If you want to go all out on your website, You can put together shopping cart technology, But that can be pricey to start out with.
Speaker 2: Sounds like a lot of work!
Speaker 1: Anything worth doing takes work. Money doesn't grow on trees... Most of us have to work for it.
Speaker 1: Why don't you phone her for a date again?
Speaker 2: I did phone her this morning, But she hung up on me. I think she is going to walk out on me.
Speaker 1: Don't jump to conclusions. Look at the bright side, Try to make another date again.
Speaker 2: I will. Thanks for your advice.
Speaker 1: I'm very glad to hear that.
Speaker 2: Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you.
Speaker 1: I am going to send Mr. Li some flowers. What about you?
Speaker 2: I intend to invite him to dinner.
Speaker 1: Right. That's why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness.
Speaker 1: I should have some free time next week. Say, Next Wednesday evening?
Speaker 2: That's good for me, But do you think you'll be back by then? I'd really like to see you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday.
Speaker 2: Great! That's settled then.
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 1: True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.
Speaker 2: A crazy language? Why do you say that?
Speaker 1: One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.
Speaker 2: No wonder you say English is a crazy language.
Speaker 1: So there isn't air in the glass boxes?
Speaker 2: No, There isn't. There is a vacuum in every box.
Speaker 1: I wonder how old these things are. Thousands of years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, They all come from a very ancient time.
Speaker 1: Hey, Look at the tripod. I've seen it on TV.
Speaker 2: It was made 4, 000 years ago. It's priceless!
Speaker 1: Are you joking? What am I going to do with you? We are going to a dinner party not the beach! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants. It's chilly outside so you can wear this coat.
Speaker 2: Thanks honey! You have such great fashion sense. Now, What am I going to do with my hair?
Speaker 1: It appears these books are two weeks late.
Speaker 2: I forgot they were due.
Speaker 1: You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees, Right?
Speaker 2: How much is the late fee?
Speaker 1: The late fee is 25 cents a day.
Speaker 2: So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late?
Speaker 1: It's 25 cents for each book.
Speaker 2: That's a lot of money.
Speaker 1: How long were you in the chair?
Speaker 2: It took quite a while, But the worst part was getting numbed. They had to give me 3 shoots.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess you've learned a good lesson, Huh. You have to take good care of your teeth.
Speaker 2: No kidding. Not only can't I stand the pain, But man... Dentists are expensive. The bill is going to be humungous!
Speaker 1: Don't you have a dental insurance?
Speaker 2: I do, But it still does not cover everything.
Speaker 1: Oh. I'm just going to take it easy.
Speaker 1: Catch it, Yi-jun! Run to the ball! Uh-oh! Slow down, You're going to hit...
Speaker 2: Ummmph!
Speaker 1: The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, Most countries are tiny.
Speaker 2: I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall.
Speaker 1: Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon.
Speaker 2: The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate.
Speaker 1: It's all so interesting. I'll have to find more information about it on the internet. Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class.
Speaker 1: Yes, But Americans never visit without calling in advance, And they almost never stay overnight.
Speaker 2: I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families.
Speaker 1: I think you're right!
Speaker 1: And stay in the shallow area. I don't want to see you go any farther than that sandbar! It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floatier.
Speaker 2: You're back already? The water was too cold, Huh? I'll tell you a secret. Do you see that small pool of water over there? It'll be warmer in there. Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some.
Speaker 1: What is that? A jellyfish? Jeremy, Put that down right now! It could sting you!
Speaker 2: Ah! Not on me! Ow!
Speaker 1: Anything else?
Speaker 2: Uh, When you live off campus, There might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus.
Speaker 1: I will think over your advice.
Speaker 2: Well, Of course, The choice is up to you. Good luck!
Speaker 1: I really appreciate your help.
Speaker 1: What position does he play?
Speaker 2: Shooting guard. The same as Michael Jordan!
Speaker 1: Oh, I love Michael Jordan. He fills people's lives with great excitement.
Speaker 2: Used to. But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this. But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now.
Speaker 1: Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer.
Speaker 2: That is not true. They are just jealous of him!
Speaker 1: Jordan is a legend, Anyway. An idol that no one can replace. I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player. He is not just about muscles he also plays smart.
Speaker 2: You know what, He is also an outstanding football player. He is surely to be a star of tomorrow.
Speaker 1: By the way, Do you know if he has a girl friend?
Speaker 2: You are so not here! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders.
Speaker 1: Oh, My chance is slim then.
Speaker 1: I agree, But I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient.
Speaker 2: Cars might be convenient, But they're so bad for the environment.
Speaker 1: Do you have a car?
Speaker 2: No. I used to have one though. Once I started using my bicycle to get around, I found that I didn't really need it.
Speaker 1: Maybe if I sold my car now, I wouldn't be so tempted to use it.
Speaker 2: You could try. It would save you a lot of money.
Speaker 1: That's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, Insurance, And repairs.
Speaker 2: If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, You will get lots of exercise, Too!
Speaker 1: I could stand to lose a few pounds. Having a car has made me lazy. I never end up walking anywhere!
Speaker 2: Let's go to a car dealership. I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price.
Speaker 1: Sounds good! Let's go!
Speaker 1: Well, You have to take the bad with the good.
Speaker 2: I guess so. I am badly off and I need this job.
Speaker 1: Not always.
Speaker 2: Is the library open on Saturdays?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What time do you open and close on Saturday?
Speaker 1: The hours are from 9 am - 6.
Speaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Do you need anything else?
Speaker 2: No, That's all. Thanks.
Speaker 1: That's true. The bus is even worse. Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired! Hey, How do you get to work every day?
Speaker 2: I ride my bike. I don't live too far away, So it's pretty convenient. It's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office.
Speaker 1: I'll bet it's good exercise, Too... A good way to keep fit.
Speaker 2: Yes, Not only a good way to keep in shape, But a good way to relieve stress as well. While you're stressed out by your commute, I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine.
Speaker 1: He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women.
Speaker 2: It is stupid to say so.
Speaker 1: Oh, Now I see what you mean. When you're reading, You are just looking, But when you are writing, You are actually doing something!
Speaker 2: A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge. Don't you think so?
Speaker 1: I think I see what you mean. I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can't write it.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So I have another question for you. What do you think is harder, Speaking or understanding?
Speaker 2: They're both harder than reading or writing.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: Because they are direct communication with another person, And there's a time limit. This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners, Even for those who know lots of English.
Speaker 1: You are making me feel really discouraged.
Speaker 2: I'm not trying to discourage you. I'm trying to help you. You have to live with these difficulties. Isn't it better to know about them? The more you know about what you have to face, The better you'll do. I promise!
Speaker 1: Was it expensive?
Speaker 2: Put it this way – it wasn't cheap.
Speaker 1: What colour is it?
Speaker 2: It's red and black.
Speaker 1: Ha-ha, See you then.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Well, Just make sure to go through the double doors, And I'll be on the right.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'll find it.
Speaker 2: It's very easy to find.
Speaker 1: See you then.
Speaker 2: I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week!
Speaker 1: That's just it! I don't know what to get her! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small! I suck at getting presents for people.
Speaker 2: That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess peoples' likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like!
Speaker 1: Yeah, You're right. When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Tell me about it. I know! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, Right? Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod.
Speaker 1: Now that's a great idea!
Speaker 1: I am glad you like it.
Speaker 2: In the market.
Speaker 1: Ok. Bottoms up.
Speaker 2: Bottoms up.
Speaker 1: It's on me.
Speaker 2: Thank you. This place is nice.
Speaker 1: What's the temperature today anyway?
Speaker 2: I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius.
Speaker 1: What other kind of music do you listen to?
Speaker 2: Actually, I mostly just listen classical music. What about you?
Speaker 1: To be honest, I think classical music is too complicated for me.
Speaker 2: What kind of music do you prefer then?
Speaker 1: I like pop music. Do you?
Speaker 2: Not really. I don't think pop music has much depth.
Speaker 1: I see what you mean. I think that's way I like it so much.
Speaker 2: How long have you been in to pop music, Then?
Speaker 1: I've always been into it. Have you always liked classical music?
Speaker 2: Not really. When I was little, We didn't really listen to music at all.
Speaker 1: So, How did you become interested in it?
Speaker 2: Well, When I was about 10 years old, I started playing the piano. I think that's how it all started.
Speaker 1: Do you still play piano?
Speaker 2: Yes, It's one of my hobbies.
Speaker 1: ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting. What do you want to have?
Speaker 2: Kebabs and roast squid.
Speaker 1: Can I have a bite?
Speaker 2: Help yourself.
Speaker 1: Super!
Speaker 1: Yes. You must fill up the car yourself.
Speaker 2: Are you serious?
Speaker 1: Yes. Are you traveling here?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm from Taiwan. I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car.
Speaker 1: In America, Most gas stations are like this.
Speaker 2: Do I really have to do it? I don't know how.
Speaker 1: Well, Since this is your first time, I will do it for you. But next time, If you want a full-service gas station, You should look at the sign.
Speaker 2: What sign?
Speaker 1: Under the sign for the gas station, There will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service. And some gas stations have both. But if they have both, Some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve. You have to look at the signs.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Their expressions were exactly the same!
Speaker 1: Well, For example, The Wall Street Journal is very, Very good. Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin.
Speaker 2: I like to read Fortune.
Speaker 1: Good. Fortune is usually ahead of the curve. And Business Week is very solid, Too.
Speaker 2: Where does a broadcast company get most of their information? I hope it's not just from press releases.
Speaker 1: A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases. Their people go out and do real reporting, Talking to people at the stock exchange, Fund managers, Analysts, Etc.
Speaker 2: But sometimes when a flimsy report, Or even a rumor gets on television, There's going to be a terrible 'echo chamber' effect.
Speaker 1: You are right about that.
Speaker 1: I can't believe it. My parents never beat me.
Speaker 2: You know that my father is irritable.
Speaker 1: You can ask the teacher for help.
Speaker 2: Good idea.
Speaker 1: Aw come on! It's just some innocent fun! You know how these things are! We are gonna play drinking games, Get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Come on! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party!
Speaker 2: Good, Because my friend Wendy is getting married and I'm organizing her party!
Speaker 1: I think the Olympics help to promote world peace.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure about that. We still have many wars in the world. I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one, But the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete. There's no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other.
Speaker 1: You are so pessimistic! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed, Skill, Agility and strength. Most people hope to see someone from their country win, But I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete.
Speaker 2: Well. I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics.
Speaker 1: Now there we are in agreement!
Speaker 1: I'Ve studied home decoration as a hobby. Could I make some suggestions?
Speaker 2: Go right ahead.
Speaker 1: Well, I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room, And maybe some newdrapes for the windows. Also, A grandfather clock would look great in the den. Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room.
Speaker 2: Well, You really do have a talent for this, Alice. Thanks for the suggestions.
Speaker 1: You are welcome, Jack. Glad to be of help.
Speaker 1: What's that supposed to mean?
Speaker 2: Well, There are adhesive strips on the backs. You can stick them anywhere.
Speaker 1: When, Did you say?
Speaker 2: Round about seven.
Speaker 1: Who's coming?
Speaker 2: Peter. Peter Brown, You know. Don't forget to bring the letter.
Speaker 1: Sorry. I didn't quite catch what you said. There's a lot of noise outside.
Speaker 2: I told you not to forget to bring the letter.
Speaker 1: Loretta? No, She can't come, She's busy.
Speaker 1: There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.
Speaker 2: I see! Do you want to ask her out?
Speaker 1: Sure, But how?
Speaker 2: You can ask her out for drinks after work.
Speaker 1: But for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.
Speaker 2: Then you've got a lot of work to do. You need to get her to notice you first.
Speaker 1: Easier said than done.
Speaker 2: You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying 'hello' to her.
Speaker 1: But I always get tongue-tied when I see her.
Speaker 2: That's something you need to overcome. Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased.
Speaker 1: I see. I'll try.
Speaker 2: Good luck!
Speaker 1: Good idea. That's why i think i have culture. You have any other suggestions?
Speaker 2: What's the matter with these ideas?
Speaker 1: They are good, But i still need a few more.
Speaker 2: What about going on a picnic?
Speaker 1: Cool, But what if the weather is not ideal?
Speaker 2: You can also take her to the art museum or a cafe. Certainly, I must come up with something you can use. How do you like the ideas i am giving you?
Speaker 1: They are all good.
Speaker 1: You know, Just giving me lots to do. I'm really busy right now.
Speaker 2: Are you? What are you busy with?
Speaker 1: Oh, Lots of things. Mostly training new people.
Speaker 1: So, What did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, Obviously.
Speaker 2: I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't get through a whole game before I had to sit down.
Speaker 1: Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming?
Speaker 2: I wanted to, But the water is too cold, And I just wetted in up to my knees.
Speaker 1: It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that.
Speaker 2: It looks like you could use it. Don't tell me you spent the weekend in the library again.
Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?
Speaker 2: Yes, Please. Thank you for everything.
Speaker 1: I want to study abroad.
Speaker 2: What do you want to study?
Speaker 1: I hope to study English Literature.
Speaker 2: Have you got your visa yet?
Speaker 1: Not yet. I have an interview with a visa official today.
Speaker 2: I see. Is it your first interview?
Speaker 1: No, I'Ve already been here for 3 interviews.
Speaker 1: Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park.
Speaker 1: Today is Saturday.
Speaker 2: What is the date today?
Speaker 1: Today is July 4th.
Speaker 2: Oh, I almost forgot. Today is my mom's birthday.
Speaker 1: Call her on my cell phone. Wish her “ Happy Birthday! � Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness. Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day.
Speaker 2: Thanks! I will do that! When is your birthday?
Speaker 1: It is December 25th.
Speaker 2: Wow! What a lucky girl! Your birthday is on Christmas Day.
Speaker 1: Yes, I am lucky. I was born on Christ's birthday. Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays. When is your birthday?
Speaker 2: April 2nd. I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day. I guess I am lucky, Too!
Speaker 1: That is true! Here, Have some Granola for breakfast.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: After eating, We will take down our tent. Then we will pack everything into the canoe, We can shove off by 6.
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: How about going for swim around 10.
Speaker 2: That should work out great. You are miracle worker! You have got me awake and motivated.
Speaker 1: Happy Independence Day!
Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.
Speaker 2: You're dancing so well.
Speaker 1: You dance beautifully too.
Speaker 2: When did you learn to dance?
Speaker 1: In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz.
Speaker 1: How about tango?
Speaker 2: Oh, I like it. It's such a beautiful dance, But I can't do it well. What about you?
Speaker 1: Tango is my favorite. Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot.
Speaker 2: Thank you for the dance.
Speaker 1: My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: And what's Mrs. King doing?
Speaker 2: She's bringing something pink for Mr. King to drink. Now she's putting it... Ok.
Speaker 1: What's happening?
Speaker 2: The ladder's falling?
Speaker 1: What's Mr. King doing?
Speaker 2: He's hanging from the string. He's holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs. King.
Speaker 1: And is she helping him?
Speaker 2: No, She's running toward our house. That's her ringing the bell.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not going to answer it. I'm sleeping.
Speaker 1: Evening.
Speaker 2: Circle or stalls?
Speaker 1: Stalls.
Speaker 2: Wonderful, I'll go with you.
Speaker 1: Where is the parking structure at?
Speaker 2: It's on the west side of the campus.
Speaker 1: Do you know if the parking structure is full or not?
Speaker 2: It was empty last time I went up there.
Speaker 1: How long ago was that?
Speaker 2: I went up there early this morning.
Speaker 1: Do you think it'll be full now?
Speaker 2: It might be. You'll have to go see for yourself.
Speaker 1: What did the critic say?
Speaker 2: He didn't say it was bad, But he said that it wasn't as good as it could have been, Particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it.
Speaker 1: The movie starts at eight o 'clock, So we have plenty of time to eat and get ready.
Speaker 2: Good. Dinner is nearly ready and I'd like to watch the news before we go. The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results.
Speaker 1: I won't spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won. There were a few surprises.
Speaker 1: No, We are just too different. This isn't working.
Speaker 2: Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.
Speaker 1: I have thought about it for a while. I think it's time to move on for both of us.
Speaker 2: But I still love you.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I knew this would happen some day...
Speaker 1: Then why didn't you talk to me?
Speaker 2: Well. It's not all my fault, Anna...
Speaker 1: I don't want to argue with you anymore. This is going to be tough, But Let's try and be friends.
Speaker 2: I would like that Anna, But I think I'll need a little space for a bit.
Speaker 1: I think we'll be better off if we are apart.
Speaker 2: Shall we keep Our friendship?
Speaker 1: Sure, Let's just be friends.
Speaker 1: Well, I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car!
Speaker 2: A new car! You're kidding!
Speaker 1: No, Really! And she told me the secret to winning, Wear red underwear!
Speaker 2: Wear red underwear?! Does that really work? Are you going to try it?
Speaker 1: Of course! I'm not only going to wear red underwear, But I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt, Too!
Speaker 2: Gee, I don't think I own any red underwear, But I can buy some!
Speaker 1: I guess I was stunned for a moment, Then I quickly ran away to get help.
Speaker 2: Did you call the police?
Speaker 1: Yes. Fortunately, I had my cell with me this morning. I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help.
Speaker 1: Oh, I learned that he is also a legendary violinist.
Speaker 2: Absolutely right. He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto. That caused a sensation. The audience were stunned by his pure tone.
Speaker 1: Obviously you did enjoy the concert.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Well, My dear, I didn't believe it either. But I got it straight from the horse's mouth. David called me this morning.
Speaker 2: So when did this all happen?
Speaker 1: Last weekend, While they were on their ski trip.
Speaker 2: Well, I believe it now, And when are they are getting married?
Speaker 1: Next June.
Speaker 2: I can hardly believe it.
Speaker 1: Nothing. Just that I don't care for these carrots. Hi,Sis., I saw you buy some chocolate cakes. I am done with the main course. It's about time for some dessert.
Speaker 2: Oh, You want my chocolate cakes, So to speak!
Speaker 1: No, No, I'm just thinking of some dessert. And I have had enough carrots.
Speaker 2: Daniel, Carrots contain much Vitamin C. It is good for you.
Speaker 1: I know, But chocolate cake is even better.
Speaker 2: Oh, Stop it! You know you need vegetables. You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet, Now.
Speaker 1: Well, Actually, I don't mind eating carrots, But chocolate cakes are much better. You know I was born with a sweet tooth.
Speaker 1: Fine, What do you call this?
Speaker 2: Foxtrot. Oh. You're a good dancer.
Speaker 1: Really? Thank you. I am thinking the same thing about you.
Speaker 2: I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely.
Speaker 1: Yes, This coming Saturday.
Speaker 2: Thanks for inviting me, Jack, But I'Ve already made plans for this weekend. I won't be able to come, I'm afraid.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, That's too bad.
Speaker 1: Well, Perhaps, Another time.
Speaker 1: Cool. Your guitar skills are very impressive. How did you learn to play like that?
Speaker 2: I picked up guitar at an early age, Maybe around 8 years old. Afterward, I taught myself by listening to some records of top players.
Speaker 1: Wow, That's unbelievable! You play so well, But you've never been to a real teacher. You will definitely be famous in the near future.
Speaker 1: Certainly. Mr. Lee's office building at the south end of the campus, Just beside the library.
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Let me show you the way. Please follow me.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much. It's very kind of you.
Speaker 1: My pleasure.
Speaker 2: This is it?
Speaker 1: It's up on the second floor. You have to use the stairs. The elevator isn't working.
Speaker 1: Believe it or not, I guess American women like a man in good shape, Which Chinese women may not care about so much. That's my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.
Speaker 2: American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, There aren't many chances.
Speaker 1: No, That's not true. I'Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese. But those Chinese look very strong and healthy. So if you exercise more often, I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls. How old is Jacky Chan? He's small and short. But I bet he can have any American woman he wants.
Speaker 2: You know, That's going to be a tremendous change for me. Because I never exercise.
Speaker 1: Why don't you try then? Even if it doesn't help you find an American girl, You could still have a stronger and healthier body. You won't lose anything by doing that.
Speaker 1: Hey, You can dance to rap music!
Speaker 2: I can't dance to it. And I know you can't either. Because I've seen you try.
Speaker 1: Wow!!!
Speaker 2: And she's good at sports, Too. She knows how to play tennis and basketball.
Speaker 1: That's terrific!
Speaker 2: But there's one thing she's not good at.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: She's not good at remembering things. We have a date, And she's an hour late!!
Speaker 1: And when do you prepare for your final exam?
Speaker 2: Honestly speaking, Most students prepare it one month before the exam.
Speaker 1: Really? You only review your lessons in one month? Does it work?
Speaker 2: Of course, It's useful. And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes, Because most questions in the exam are based on them.
Speaker 1: Wow, And all the key points are included in them? You're so smart!
Speaker 2: But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine. We have to stay up late.
Speaker 1: Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night?
Speaker 2: Yes, Some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there. That's a little bit crazy.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to university?
Speaker 2: My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing, But I decided to go back to England. I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication.
Speaker 1: What is your current occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a journalist. I write for China Daily.
Speaker 1: Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't. I started working at a university in London but as time went by, I found I did not really like my job. I decided to explore other fields. Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge.
Speaker 1: Do you like your current job?
Speaker 2: Yes, I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities. I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company.
Speaker 1: Yes, You are right.
Speaker 2: Why don't you try and give it up?
Speaker 1: I've tried to give up smoking several times, But it's no use.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Yeah, I know, It's totally cliche, But really, I think it's been a good decision. I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys. What about you? What have you been up to?
Speaker 2: Not much. I'm still living at home and commuting to school. I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.
Speaker 1: That sounds smart... But kind of boring.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It is, A little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors Club, Though, Which has been a lot of fun. We've gone on two camping trips already, And I've made some good friends.
Speaker 1: That's cool. Hey, So have you decided on your major yet?
Speaker 2: Definitely pre-med. What about you?
Speaker 1: I still have no clue... But we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year, So I've got time! Oops, I'm late for class. Gotta run!
Speaker 2: Ok, Take care! Hey, Nice running into you!
Speaker 1: Yeah, You too!
Speaker 1: The cause is another boy.
Speaker 2: Oh, That's too bad.
Speaker 1: Do you know where the visa office is?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's just near the Dong Si ShiTiao subway stop.
Speaker 1: I am not wrong! The chicken came first!
Speaker 2: No! The egg came first!
Speaker 1: Please told Tim to close the door to the basement. I don't want dog down there tonight.
Speaker 2: Ok, Good night, See you at breakfast.
Speaker 1: It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active.
Speaker 1: That's right. And it's a B that I'll be writing too. Her name is Olga.
Speaker 2: Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English.
Speaker 1: That's a great idea! Why didn't I think of that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, But you know how to surround yourself with great friends!
Speaker 1: Then my son drove into a tree.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 1: The dog bit the delivery boy.
Speaker 2: What a pity!
Speaker 1: And a storm blew our roof away.
Speaker 2: Ho, No!
Speaker 1: I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday. I want to exchange some Japanese yen.
Speaker 2: I see. Will you bring a lot of money with you?
Speaker 1: Not really. I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan.
Speaker 2: Do you have the bank card in Japan?
Speaker 1: Nope. You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries.
Speaker 2: That sounds really convenient. Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service?
Speaker 1: No. It is free of charge.
Speaker 2: Great! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later.
Speaker 1: I think we are running out of time. The bank is going to close soon.
Speaker 1: Me neither. All I have to do is study French hard.
Speaker 2: I wish you the best of luck.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you answer my question?
Speaker 2: What question?
Speaker 1: Do you love me? Come on, I'm eager to hear.
Speaker 2: You know that I care for you. I---I'm proud of you.
Speaker 1: Don't cherish your words, Dear.
Speaker 2: I---I don't feel like saying it.
Speaker 1: Who is your favorite author?
Speaker 2: I like the novels of Dickens very much. I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation.
Speaker 1: Are you a music lover?
Speaker 2: Yes, I like listening to Beethoven's works.
Speaker 1: What kinds of films do you enjoy?
Speaker 2: I like all kinds as long as they are exciting.
Speaker 1: What kind of books are you interested in?
Speaker 2: My favorite books are those about detectives.
Speaker 1: Well, Those books are really good. I like them too. How do you entertain yourself?
Speaker 2: When it comes to the entertainment, I think I enjoy dancing. There is nothing I like more than modern dance.
Speaker 1: It's boring, Right?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Do you get much rain during the summer?
Speaker 2: Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area.
Speaker 1: So you should bring an umbrella often.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Hey, Ken. Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm with you on that.
Speaker 1: Yes, But they do it differently. Everything is different.
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: Well, The climate's different for a start. It doesn't rain so much as it does in England. The sun shines more often.
Speaker 2: I envy them the sun.
Speaker 1: I know. You hate the rain, Don't you?
Speaker 2: I certainly do.
Speaker 1: And a Roman really Ioves life. Eye knows how to enjoy himself.
Speaker 2: They always eat spaghetti and drink wine, Don't they?
Speaker 1: Not always. But they like a good meal. Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food, You know.
Speaker 2: Really? How much does it cost to fly to Rome?
Speaker 1: I don't know exactly, But it costs a lot of money.
Speaker 1: I am not picky on food. Just bring me the day menu.
Speaker 1: Actually, The woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine.
Speaker 2: Really? Is that why you wanted to come to the play?
Speaker 1: That's only part of it. I absolutely adore this director. Every play he works on turns out great.
Speaker 2: So you've seen other plays that he's directed?
Speaker 1: Quite a few actually. By the way, After the play, There's always a big party for the cast and their friends. My friend has invited us. Do you want to go?
Speaker 2: Sure, I'd love to meet the cast! Have you ever been in a play?
Speaker 1: I've never had a part in a play before, But I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: I helped build the sets and find props for the plays. What about you?
Speaker 2: I once helped out with costumes, But I didn't enjoy it very much.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat.
Speaker 1: That sounds kind of boring. Oh, Look. They're dimming the lights. I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play.
Speaker 1: Uh, Yeah. And I've seen guys in pads tackled. We have no pads. I don't want to be tackled.
Speaker 2: There's barely any contact in touch football. People just tag you to stop the play.
Speaker 1: Ok, But they better tag lightly!
Speaker 1: I was in a comfortable place, So really, It's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long?
Speaker 2: Yes. When I came out of the subway, It was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up.
Speaker 1: I totally understand.
Speaker 1: Which is better?
Speaker 2: One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers.
Speaker 1: I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school.
Speaker 2: Yes, Sometimes.
Speaker 1: What kind of job do you want after graduation?
Speaker 2: I want to become a professor, A lawyer, An editor, A civil servant...
Speaker 1: Wait! You can't do so many things at the same time. What exactly do you want?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Do you have any advice for me?
Speaker 1: Yeah, You should first decide what kind of career you really want, Plan your career path, And then try your best to achieve your goal.
Speaker 2: I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career.
Speaker 1: No, You can't waste your time wandering around. If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma, You should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much for your advice. I'll think it over.
Speaker 1: I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons. First, It's just like a big party. They can meet each other and network. The other thing is that it is great advertising. All the journalists and photographers are there. Thirdly, It give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing.
Speaker 2: You meant it's an expression of their fantasies?
Speaker 1: Yes. I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren't concerned with what other people might think. In a way, The designers are saying ‘ don't worry about what others think. Wear what you like! '.
Speaker 2: Very philosophical. I think they design these clothes more for publicity. They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous, But still stylish.
Speaker 1: Come on. All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll enjoy the trip. China is such a beautiful country.
Speaker 1: I'm sure I will.
Speaker 2: Have a nice journey, Lily.
Speaker 1: Thank you, David.
Speaker 1: Look at the ticket booth in the center. There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be.
Speaker 2: Yeah. We are lucky. Let's go buy the tickets first. We can have breakfast later. I am so hungry.
Speaker 1: Good idea.
Speaker 2: ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to?
Speaker 1: I have no idea. Let me take a closer look at my museum map.
Speaker 2: Sure, Take your time. We have a whole day.
Speaker 1: It's on the 2nd floor. We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece.
Speaker 2: Look at the museum guide. It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area. Let's rent an audio guide.
Speaker 1: Yes, It's beautiful, But it's also very hot.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's the weather like in your country?
Speaker 2: Mm... It's quite warm now.
Speaker 1: Where do you live?
Speaker 2: In London. Where do you live?
Speaker 1: Here. Near this school.
Speaker 1: Really? I hope we will do much better under her guidance.
Speaker 2: I am sure we will.
Speaker 1: Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits, Like unemployment benefit and child support benefit. The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment.
Speaker 2: My son likes going to the main post office. They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection.
Speaker 1: Do you think that the service at post offices has improved?
Speaker 2: I think it's better for some things, Like sending and receiving money, But if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to.
Speaker 1: I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office. It means that I don't need to go to two places.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Right. But what did you put on your face last night? Those little greenish things.
Speaker 2: They are cucumbers. They are natural skin soothers, Natural healers of the skin. Haven't you heard them say on TV that... Eh... They soften the skin, Wipe out the roughness, Counter irritation and build strength and resilience?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! They wipe out tight, Tired feelings and remove lines and age signs. Blah, Blah... See, I can even recite it.
Speaker 2: That's right. You have learned a lot, Haven't you?
Speaker 1: You cannot judge a person that way. I have a hunch that he is a sly dog.
Speaker 2: Depends on with whom. He may be doing things on the sly, But he is honest with me. I trust him.
Speaker 1: You can never tell. He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it.
Speaker 1: It is nice, But it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off histush and help me. Ha-ha... Have this. It's from Italy!
Speaker 1: I Know. And you should be more careful, Too.
Speaker 1: My last appointment is at 3, So I should be free by 5 at the very latest. I think I could get to the airport by 6.
Speaker 2: Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5?
Speaker 1: No, Not really.
Speaker 2: So you are not sure how long it will take to get there?
Speaker 1: No, But I am sure it won't take more than an hour.
Speaker 2: Don't forget it's Friday nighty. If Frankfurt's anything like London, Everybody will be leaving for the weekend. It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly.
Speaker 1: You are a pessimist.
Speaker 2: I am a realist.
Speaker 1: I am not sure what a handicapped spot is.
Speaker 2: Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces. Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening?
Speaker 1: I park days and evenings.
Speaker 2: Be careful about the time limits on the streets. Have you seen the signs for time limits?
Speaker 1: What signs?
Speaker 2: As long as you are careful reading the signs, You will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there. Are you aware of the curb colors?
Speaker 1: What curb colors?
Speaker 2: If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload, You are going to be OK.
Speaker 1: Borrow morning.
Speaker 2: All right. What should I take?
Speaker 1: Just take your golf club. I will pick you up Borrow.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I will wait you at my home.
Speaker 1: See you Borrow.
Speaker 1: Who wouldn't? Wow, That's out of this world.
Speaker 2: It is special, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Too cool. How much did they sold you for?
Speaker 2: Lots. Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years.
Speaker 1: I can imagine.
Speaker 2: Hey, Let's go for a spin. You can try it out.
Speaker 1: I'd love to.
Speaker 2: Ok, Let's go.
Speaker 1: How is everything?
Speaker 2: Just fine, And you?
Speaker 1: Quite well, Thank you.
Speaker 2: Did you drive yourself to the airport?
Speaker 1: No, I was driven by my husband.
Speaker 2: Did someone meet you at the airport here?
Speaker 1: Yes, Thanks.
Speaker 2: Is this where we'll be holding the meeting?
Speaker 1: No, The meeting will be held on the fourth floor.
Speaker 1: By the way, Where can I go ski?
Speaker 2: There are so many places around. Take a look at the advertisement.
Speaker 1: I might. What did you do yesterday?
Speaker 2: Uh, Nothing much, Just went to bed early. I was still tired from Saturday.
Speaker 1: She said she would name it after her father.
Speaker 2: Oh, I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father.
Speaker 1: Well, I have a lot of work. I'll see how to goes.
Speaker 1: How do you think of the weather today?
Speaker 2: I don't like the weather like this. Cold and rainy. Hope it become sunny as soon as possible.
Speaker 1: I'm glad to hear that. Bye.
Speaker 2: See you later.
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 1: No, He doesn't!!! He plays the trumpet. So, What kind of music do you like?
Speaker 2: I like rock a lot.
Speaker 1: Who's your favorite group?
Speaker 2: The Cranberries. I love their music. How about you? Do you like them?
Speaker 1: No, I don't. I can't stand them!!
Speaker 1: True. True.
Speaker 2: Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health?
Speaker 1: Really? Did Coke pay him for that?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: You want something to drink?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Got a Coke?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Hurry, The movie is coming back on.
Speaker 1: I feel much better, But I'm still worried about something.
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Well, I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning, And I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic.
Speaker 2: That's annoying, But nothing to worry about.
Speaker 1: For me, Traffic jams are quite stressful, Because I'm pretty impatient. How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam?
Speaker 2: Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'll try that.
Speaker 2: Is there anything else bothering you?
Speaker 1: Just one more thing. A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do.
Speaker 2: Do you have any other plans this weekend?
Speaker 1: I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday.
Speaker 2: Try not to take on more than you can handle.
Speaker 1: You're right. I probably should just work on my paper. Thanks!
Speaker 1: Wow, You're so lucky. I saw it on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall.
Speaker 2: That's for sure. You know, I had the greatest time ever.
Speaker 1: That means he was head over heels in love with you.
Speaker 2: Well, He indeed likes me.
Speaker 1: But I think he can't hold a candle to you. I don't think he has ever popped the question.
Speaker 2: No, He is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel.
Speaker 1: What's the expiration date on your passport?
Speaker 2: I think it's soon, Maybe in a few months. It was renewed in Beijing, So the new expiry date is on the last page.
Speaker 1: I see. Yes, You'll need to renew your passport in a few months. Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK.
Speaker 2: I won't.
Speaker 1: Do you have anything to declare?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have anything to declare.
Speaker 1: How long will you be staying in the UK?
Speaker 2: I'll be here for about a year.
Speaker 1: What is the purpose of your stay?
Speaker 2: I'll be studying. I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University.
Speaker 1: Where will you be staying?
Speaker 2: I have a housing contract with the university. I'll be in a dorm room on campus.
Speaker 1: How do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here?
Speaker 2: My father has already paid for that in advance. Here are the receipts.
Speaker 1: Ok. Have a good day. Here's your passport and documents back.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: So you can always keep two times at once?
Speaker 2: Yep. I just can't decide what two cities to choose...
Speaker 1: The only two times you need are I'm late and I'm really late.
Speaker 1: Phrases and sentence patterns are also very important. You should know how to use them.
Speaker 2: Should we remember all the new words and expressions?
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit. I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems.
Speaker 1: Well. When you review your lessons, Mark the places which you don't understand, Then I will give you some coaching.
Speaker 2: When shall we have a coaching period?
Speaker 1: How about tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.
Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.
Speaker 1: How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet?
Speaker 2: Maybe it can take effect.
Speaker 1: Very good. Sit down, Please. Susan, What's the general idea of the text?
Speaker 2: Can I answer it in Chinese?
Speaker 1: No, You can't. This is an English class, And you have to express yourself in English.
Speaker 2: Let me have a try. The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities. They are quiet, Shy and reserved...
Speaker 1: Excellent. Class is over. Let's have a break.
Speaker 1: Nothing particular.
Speaker 2: Why don't you join us? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare.
Speaker 1: Oh, Tibet sounds great, But I'm afraid it'll cost too much. Last time I traveled to India, And it cost me a fortune.
Speaker 2: Come on! We're traveling on our own. It won't cost too much.
Speaker 1: Ok, Then count me in. Where will we stay?
Speaker 2: The youth hotels are comfortable and cheap.
Speaker 1: Then make sure that you book me a room, Too.
Speaker 2: I'll take care of it.
Speaker 1: And check whether they accept credit cards.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: I'm a student from out of state, So I don't have a local driver's license.
Speaker 2: Do you have a current electricity or gas bill in your name?
Speaker 1: The phone bill's in my name.
Speaker 2: That'll do. Bring the most recent one in with your completed application, And we'll issue you a temporary library card right away.
Speaker 1: How long will it take to get the regular one?
Speaker 2: It'll be mailed to you within two weeks, But you can borrow books on the temporary card.
Speaker 1: Okay. Thanks for your help.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: It was no big deal.
Speaker 1: What do your parents think of your dating a boy?
Speaker 2: They're glad that I finally got a boyfriend.
Speaker 1: They're glad?!
Speaker 1: Well, I'm from Chicago. There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors.
Speaker 2: So, Tell me, Karl, Hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live?
Speaker 1: We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space. Another reason is, We can afford to buy a home here, But we can't in Chicago!
Speaker 1: Don't worry. I won't.
Speaker 2: I'm signing off.
Speaker 1: Have fun getting ripped off!
Speaker 1: Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college. Have you decide what you are going to do when you graduated?
Speaker 2: I am going to be a, Well, I hope to be a research chemist.
Speaker 1: You are really a hen-pecked husband.
Speaker 1: Yeah, My wife likes that one, Too. Personally, I prefer action movies.
Speaker 1: Have you tried these littleditties? They are really good.
Speaker 2: Thanks. They look delicious.
Speaker 1: Can I get you some punch? I was just going to go get myself some.
Speaker 2: That would be great. I would love some.
Speaker 1: Good start. You knocked eight pins down. But you are left with a 7, 10 split. Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl, It is going to be impossible.
Speaker 2: I certainly can try... No! It went straight through the wickets.
Speaker 2: They are just been in friendly, When you are in Roman, Do as the Romans do, That means you need to adapt to your enviroment.
Speaker 1: What if everybody in the wheres goes crazy?
Speaker 2: Then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy.
Speaker 1: Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches, I am supposed to wonder run reget?
Speaker 2: Do you think it is a ~ got give your brain, Use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head, Keep distance from them, Why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you.
Speaker 1: That is my work, I will try it.
Speaker 1: Oh my, No internet access is killing me.
Speaker 2: Can't you wait till you get home? Then you can surf the internet using the broadband, Wireless connection or whatever you like.
Speaker 1: No, I'm not feeling myself. I just want to check my emails, Visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends.
Speaker 2: Now I see, You must be suffering from discomgoogolation.
Speaker 1: What does that mean? There's nothing wrong with me.
Speaker 2: Well, The term \"discomgoogolation\" comes from \"discombobulate\" and \"google\". Because floods of information are just a mouse click away, Net users are very likely to become addicted to the web.
Speaker 1: That's alright. I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information. It almost drives me crazy.
Speaker 2: Then, You're probably addicted.
Speaker 1: That sounds really interesting. Can you speak Swahili?
Speaker 2: Yes, I learned how to speak it when I was little.
Speaker 1: Really? How did you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in Africa, So I learned quite a few different languages.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. Are you doing well in your classes?
Speaker 2: I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet.
Speaker 1: When did you take your exams?
Speaker 2: About two weeks ago.
Speaker 1: How do you think you did?
Speaker 2: I left feeling pretty confident about my score, But I heard that my professors are very strict graders, So I'm a bit nervous.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you'll do well. Did you study hard?
Speaker 2: You know me ; I'm always studying!
Speaker 1: Don't worry. If you don't do well, No one can!
Speaker 2: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Justin!
Speaker 1: No, I didn't save this time. Damn it! And I'm sick of writing this paper. Now I have to write it all over again too.
Speaker 2: I've had that problem too many times. So I learned to save. When I'm writing something, I save every three sentences or so. I don't want to lose anything.
Speaker 1: I hate computers. Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth.
Speaker 2: What are we going to do now?
Speaker 1: I don't know. I feel like going out.
Speaker 2: I wonder how much of the city is down.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter. I still can go out and buy a beer.
Speaker 2: Maybe. But if there's a blackout, Probably the pubs are closed. And besides, I know you have a political science exam tomorrow. I thought you had a lot of reading to do.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's true. Damn! I just lost half my paper, And now I can't even do my homework. This is a bad time for this to happen.
Speaker 2: I have a flashlight in my closet. If you want to use that to read, You can.
Speaker 1: The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a notice.
Speaker 2: The headmaster asked them not to do so.
Speaker 1: Then why isn't there a notice?
Speaker 2: They went to their stores to get one. Here they come with it now!
Speaker 1: But look at them! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice!
Speaker 1: Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now.
Speaker 2: Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?
Speaker 1: You're really hot. Let me get you someTylenol to bring the fever down.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll stay home this morning and rest, But if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting.
Speaker 1: Zach, What's that on your arm?
Speaker 2: I don't know. It looks a bit red, But I'm sure it's nothing.
Speaker 1: It looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything?
Speaker 2: Just cats, But I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no. We'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine. Let's go.
Speaker 2: Shouldn't we make an appointment first?
Speaker 1: We would, But let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse.
Speaker 2: Whatever you say. I just want to get to my meeting!
Speaker 1: That's a good school. What do you study?
Speaker 2: I'm studying English, Math, And history. My major is English.
Speaker 1: How long have you been studying English?
Speaker 2: More than six years.
Speaker 1: That's a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started to learn English when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: No wonder your English is so good.
Speaker 2: Actually, It's not that good. I can read but I can't speak very well. I haven't had a lot of chance to practice.
Speaker 1: I see. Talking with other people is very important.
Speaker 2: Yes, But I still don't have many friends here yet.
Speaker 1: I'm having a party tonight at my apartment. You should come.
Speaker 2: Oh thanks for inviting me. I'd love to come.
Speaker 1: That's funny, I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside.
Speaker 2: Hey, How would you like to taste my fist?
Speaker 1: Alright, All joking aside, What kinds of moves do you like?
Speaker 2: Um, Let me see, Romance, Comedy. Documentary, Action, Science fiction, Animated and so on.
Speaker 1: That is to say, You like all genres except for horror movies.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned.
Speaker 1: Not quite. I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy.
Speaker 2: The Notebook is this type of movie.
Speaker 1: Really? I haven't heard of it.
Speaker 2: Well then, This could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together. I bet you'd love it.
Speaker 1: Ok. I can't wait to see it. Let's go!
Speaker 1: Sure. But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters. What do they say?
Speaker 2: They are puzzles. It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival.
Speaker 1: Very interesting. But I'm afraid we'd better do something else. Hey, Look! There is a huge lantern there. Let's get close to it.
Speaker 2: It's really eye-catching. It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life.
Speaker 1: Really? Then I'm really lucky. Oh, It's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth.
Speaker 2: Very impressive. It's made of glass which makes it even brighter.
Speaker 1: There are many Chinese characters on its body, Too. What are they about? Puzzles?
Speaker 2: Let me have a look. Oh, No. They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene.
Speaker 1: What's new with you?
Speaker 2: Do you still remember Justin?
Speaker 1: Of course, He was our monitor in college. How is him now?
Speaker 2: He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend. I found his blogs were a little sad.
Speaker 1: Let me see. What a moving poem!
Speaker 1: But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company, So new employees get quite low salary, No matter how excellent they have done.
Speaker 2: That's shortsighted. By the time the workers are experienced and contributing. They are likely to go.
Speaker 1: That's why I am going to leave.
Speaker 2: But you have already worked there for five years.
Speaker 1: I am worried about my future. I can't believe that our company is as big as it is. The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff.
Speaker 2: Well. The management doesn't seem to think that way. Anyways, You have to think twice before you act.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I will.
Speaker 1: Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.
Speaker 2: Well, Children usually resemble their parents.
Speaker 1: It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.
Speaker 2: You often like comparing children with their parents.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 1: Hi! This is Jill. How come you didn't come in today?
Speaker 2: Oh, We had a birthday party for David last night. As a matter of fact I woke up with a terrible hangover.
Speaker 1: That's too bad. You'll have to be more careful nest time.
Speaker 2: Anything new at the office?
Speaker 1: No, Nothing special. Oh, Yes, You know Bill, The guy with themoustache. His wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today, He said his wife and daughter are doing fine. The baby is their first child.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful! We've got to celebrate!
Speaker 1: Yes, We have to. Do you think you can make it tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Sure. I ought to be ready for some more drinks by then. Thank you for calling.
Speaker 1: You're welcome. Bye.
Speaker 1: Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.
Speaker 2: Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.
Speaker 1: Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.
Speaker 2: I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brain power.
Speaker 1: You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, But dance might make you livelier and happier.
Speaker 1: That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.
Speaker 1: I bought it in a store near my school.
Speaker 2: How much is it?
Speaker 1: It's only thirty yuan.
Speaker 2: It's so cheap. I'll buy one, Too.
Speaker 1: I'll go together with you.
Speaker 1: Really? What's the catch?
Speaker 2: There's no catch! You just choose a plan, Sign a three-year contract and, That's it! Actually, We're running a special promotion right now, And we're giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan.
Speaker 1: So what does this plan include?
Speaker 2: Well, You get nine hundred anytime minutes, And you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients, One thousand text messages per month, And unlimited evening and weekend minutes. Oh, And we also offer a rollover option.
Speaker 1: Wow, All this for forty dollars per month?
Speaker 2: That's right, Plus the activation fee, The emergency services fee, The monthly service fee, Oh, And any charges for extra minutes, And...
Speaker 1: Yes, It's all taken care of.
Speaker 2: Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?
Speaker 1: I can stay a few more minutes.
Speaker 2: Ok, But please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!
Speaker 2: Go do what you have to do, But make sure it doesn't happen again.
Speaker 1: Yes. Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year, But only rich people can do it.
Speaker 2: There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes.
Speaker 1: I wish I could be one of those people, But my budget simply doesn't stretch that far. I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy.
Speaker 2: I know what you mean. The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children. The we'll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes!
Speaker 1: What's the matter with you? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there.
Speaker 2: I'm terribly sorry, Rose. But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But Laurie, How can you do well in school if you don't take more notes?
Speaker 1: What do you mean? You think I don't write enough.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you don't write enough. Look at this. Here you wrote, Russian Revolution. 1917. Bolsheviks. Real revolution, Or coup? And that's all? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question. And you didn't write any of it!
Speaker 1: I know, But I listened.
Speaker 2: Yes, But did you remember? You need good notes to help you remember.
Speaker 1: I suppose you're right. But what can I do? I don't know what to write down.
Speaker 2: There are different things you can do. For one, The university offers a special free course on note-taking. You should go to the course. Also, I am pretty good at taking notes. I can help you on this exam. I will photocopy all my notes, And you can compare them to your notes. Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down.
Speaker 1: That would really help me, Sue. I appreciate it. All this makes me feel like an idiot.
Speaker 2: Don't feel that way. I know you are very smart. Note - taking is a special skill. All students need to learn it. Some people are very smart, But they just haven't learned how to take notes yet. I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school. She taught me how to take good notes. It's not hard.
Speaker 1: Alright. University and high school seem very different to me. I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes. Then I will do better.
Speaker 1: All of your friends, What are you planning to do?
Speaker 2: We're going fishing.
Speaker 1: What a party! I hope you don't expect the girls to fish.
Speaker 2: These girls are different, They are not wimpy.
Speaker 1: They're blue.
Speaker 2: What color is her hair?
Speaker 1: It's brown.
Speaker 2: How old is she?
Speaker 1: She's 42.
Speaker 1: Well, Maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, Brave and hopeful!
Speaker 2: I hope you are right.
Speaker 1: Surely, I'll have one made for you. You want a print?
Speaker 2: No. I'd like a slide, I have a new projector.
Speaker 1: I'd like to see that myself.
Speaker 2: Have a wallet size print made for me, Too.
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 1: Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work.
Speaker 2: I don't mind the work. I think it's worthwhile.
Speaker 1: Sorry, I don't have any coffee.
Speaker 2: That's OK. I'll have a glass of water.
Speaker 1: A small glass, Or a big one?
Speaker 2: Small please.
Speaker 1: Here you are.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Well, You'Ve adapted yourself very well. Everyone in our office thinks you'Ve made a great progress in the past two years. What is your secret?
Speaker 2: It is so encouraging to hear this remark. The secret is to make plans. Write down your goals, Short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month. Then just work hard.
Speaker 1: Don't get ahead of yourself. Fat boy isn't yours yet.
Speaker 2: His name is not fat boy! You can be so rude sometimes.
Speaker 1: The tie is necessary for man. It makes you look so attractive in a super tie.
Speaker 2: Match is important ; well, The way of tying is also important.
Speaker 1: My father dose not know how to tie a tie, For he often wears a cravat.
Speaker 2: My father wears a tie every day, But he can't do it himself. My mother helps him with his tie every morning.
Speaker 1: You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife.
Speaker 1: No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a \"tornado watch.\" That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.
Speaker 2: I understand. They think a tornado might come.
Speaker 1: Yes. People should look out, Because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a \"watch.\".
Speaker 2: And the second stage is called a \"tornado warning\".
Speaker 1: Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, They announce a \"tornado warning\". So if there's a tornado warning on, It means a tornado is out there somewhere.
Speaker 2: It's scary.
Speaker 1: Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, It's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, Then we have to go in the basement.
Speaker 2: What do you mean \"a loud train\"?
Speaker 1: That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.
Speaker 2: But if you hear them coming, Isn't it already too late?
Speaker 1: Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.
Speaker 2: Have you seen a lot of them?
Speaker 1: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.
Speaker 2: Did it hit their house?
Speaker 1: No, It didn't. But they are glad I called them.
Speaker 2: What were they doing when you called?
Speaker 1: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, They could have all been killed.
Speaker 2: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?
Speaker 1: Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes.
Speaker 1: How obnoxious! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes.
Speaker 2: He not only sent me nasty e-mail, But he's so bored, He even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him!
Speaker 1: All right, I will explain it to you later on. Now scram.
Speaker 2: Ok. I will wait until you have had your fun, If that's what you want.
Speaker 1: That's exactly what I want, Thank you.
Speaker 1: Will you get a pay-raise, Too?
Speaker 2: Whenever you are given added responsibilities, You should get a promotion.
Speaker 1: That makes sense. Who interviewed you?
Speaker 2: My boss.
Speaker 1: What kinds of questions did she ask you?
Speaker 2: She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be.
Speaker 1: The second one sounds rather difficult to answer. What did you tell her?
Speaker 2: I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally.
Speaker 1: Those are good answers. How did she react?
Speaker 2: She told me that even when I become a senior engineer, I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team.
Speaker 1: What do you think about her as a boss?
Speaker 2: She's pretty easy to get along with. She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally.
Speaker 1: You're lucky. Not everyone has such a great boss!
Speaker 2: That's true. She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company.
Speaker 1: When you find out you get the promotion or not, Let me know.
Speaker 2: I will do.
Speaker 1: Well, What's your excuse then?
Speaker 2: My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes?
Speaker 2: It's true, Sir.
Speaker 1: We will only be needing it for Sunday.
Speaker 2: Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it.
Speaker 1: The only two drivers will be Mary and I.
Speaker 2: If I give you the keys to the garage, Could you bring it back on Sunday evening?
Speaker 1: Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be OK?
Speaker 2: Ok, But make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm crazy about them.
Speaker 1: All right!
Speaker 2: Here comes Jordan, Though.
Speaker 1: Wow, Michael Jordan's slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He's older, So he doesn't slam, As much as he did when he was younger, But when he does, It's still amazing.
Speaker 1: Which team do you think will win?
Speaker 2: The Lakers. Jordan is the only good player Washington has.
Speaker 1: Dark blue.
Speaker 2: How old is she?
Speaker 1: Twenty.
Speaker 1: Yes. And you?
Speaker 2: No. I'm from Taiwan. Can't you see?
Speaker 1: Well, There are many Chinese Americans, You know. And your English is very good. You sound like an American.
Speaker 2: I don't think so. You are flattering me.
Speaker 1: No, Really. I can only hear a little accent.
Speaker 2: Are you flying home?
Speaker 1: Well, Yes. Actually, I'm going back to visit.
Speaker 2: You were visiting Taiwan?
Speaker 1: No, I'm going back to America to visit. I'm from America, But I don't live there now. I live in Taichung.
Speaker 2: Really! You live in Taiwan!
Speaker 1: Yes. Why not?
Speaker 2: May I ask what your job is in Taiwan?
Speaker 1: Sure. I teach history in a university. Have you heard of Dong-Hai University?
Speaker 2: Of course. It's a good school. How long have you lived in Taichung?
Speaker 1: I have lived in Taichung for two years now. So this is the second time I am going back to states. I go back once a year to visit my family.
Speaker 2: It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan.
Speaker 1: No, It isn't strange at all. Many people from Taiwan move to America too, You know. Do you think it is strange for them?
Speaker 2: No. Well, I don't know. But Taiwan is so crowded. Don't you miss life in America?
Speaker 1: What school did you transfer from?
Speaker 2: I started at PCC.
Speaker 1: What made you transfer?
Speaker 2: My grades weren't good enough to go here.
Speaker 1: Did you like PCC?
Speaker 2: I loved PCC.
Speaker 1: Good luck here.
Speaker 2: I'm excited to be here.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.
Speaker 2: You're dancing so well.
Speaker 1: You dance beautifully too.
Speaker 2: When did you learn to dance?
Speaker 1: In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz.
Speaker 1: How do you celebrate it?
Speaker 2: We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them. We'll also go to church and pray.
Speaker 1: That sounds interesting.
Speaker 1: Fine, Just fine. And you?
Speaker 2: Not so well. I've come down with the flu.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that. Take care of yourself.
Speaker 2: It's really great to see you again. How about a drink tonight?
Speaker 1: Sounds wonderful. When shall we make it?
Speaker 2: How about seven?
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 2: I'll pick you up.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 1: So I take it you two are hitting it off? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor, But what if you break up?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I am not really worried about that. I don't wanna lose before even starting. Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her.
Speaker 1: Sounds like you've got some competition. You made a move already?
Speaker 2: Not yet. But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime. I know some good restaurants nearby.
Speaker 1: That's nice. Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage, Eh?
Speaker 2: You bet. Now that you mentioned it, I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight.
Speaker 1: Good luck!
Speaker 2: Thanks!
Speaker 1: No, I've been here for six months.
Speaker 2: Six months. That's a long time.
Speaker 1: It's not so long really. What class are you in? Intermediate or...?
Speaker 2: Intermediate Three. And what about you?
Speaker 1: I'm in Advanced One. Who's your teacher?
Speaker 2: I can't remember her name, But she's got curly red hair.
Speaker 1: Ah! Does she wear glasses?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: That's probably Anne Wallis.
Speaker 2: Yes that's right. Do you know her? Is she your teacher too?
Speaker 1: No. But she taught me last term. How long have you been here?
Speaker 2: Only a week.
Speaker 1: Wow, Not long. Where do you live? With a family?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment. I'm looking for somewhere more permanent. Do you know of any good places?
Speaker 1: Yes. Actually my friend has a spare room in here apartment and she's looking for a flatmate. Would you like her phone number?
Speaker 2: That would be great! Thanks for your help. Can I buy you coffee?
Speaker 1: Well, The editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.
Speaker 2: Really? That's fantastic! Will you get a chance to do any writing?
Speaker 1: She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back.
Speaker 2: Wow! That's really great news. How often does the magazine come out?
Speaker 1: It's a monthly magazine, But my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly.
Speaker 2: Are you looking forward to doing more editing work?
Speaker 1: Yes, But I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again!
Speaker 2: Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine?
Speaker 1: I don't have any with me, But I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you.
Speaker 2: I'm really looking forward to reading your column.
Speaker 1: Me, Too. Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news?
Speaker 2: Sure, Where would you like to go?
Speaker 1: Perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop.
Speaker 1: Some of my grappa will cure your shyness.
Speaker 2: Is that a kind of alcohol?
Speaker 1: It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day. You will love it!
Speaker 2: Great. My face will turn even redder!
Speaker 1: I'd better not. Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys!
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, I haven't danced for a long time.
Speaker 2: But it's said that you dance wonderfully well.
Speaker 1: Thanks for flattering me. I think you dance a lot, Right?
Speaker 2: No. Just occasionally.
Speaker 1: What are your favourite dances?
Speaker 2: I love rumba and waltz.
Speaker 1: How aboutsamba?
Speaker 2: To tell the truth, I don't like it. It's too fast.
Speaker 1: Then I'll see you at six. Is that all right?
Speaker 2: Ok. See you then.
Speaker 1: See you then.
Speaker 1: I'm really not sure. Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony, But this year there are several contenders.
Speaker 2: You're right. This year should be much more exciting than usual. What's you favourite award category?
Speaker 1: You might think this strange, But I like the category for “ best foreign language film \".
Speaker 2: It's nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood. I like the “ best actor and actress ”.
Speaker 1: You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account! Me! I'Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime!
Speaker 2: Wow! Why so much? I thought they were getting you an assistant.
Speaker 1: They were supposed to, But so far nobody's turned up, And I'm left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I'Ve had all day.
Speaker 2: They're really running you into the ground. Why don't you ask for some time off? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere.
Speaker 1: You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account! Me! I'Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime!
Speaker 2: Wow! Why so much? I thought they were getting you an assistant.
Speaker 1: They were supposed to, But so far nobody's turned up, And I'm left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I'Ve had all day.
Speaker 2: They're really running you into the ground. Why don't you ask for some time off? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere.
Speaker 1: What am I going to do?
Speaker 2: Let's go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you.
Speaker 1: I was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then.
Speaker 2: That sounds great.
Speaker 1: Ok. How about give me a ring, Then?
Speaker 2: No. I'd better not.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because I don't think my husband would like it. Thank you for inviting me anyway.
Speaker 1: It's facial paper, And it fits into the rings of my binder! It's magical.
Speaker 2: Ok. Let's see. Give me a sheet.
Speaker 1: You really don't need to.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon.
Speaker 1: I hope so, Too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me.
Speaker 2: Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington.
Speaker 2: Of course. I will.
Speaker 1: Goodbye, Then. Thanks again for everything.
Speaker 1: So, He wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea!
Speaker 2: How do you want to spend your old age?
Speaker 1: In the same way, Probably.
Speaker 1: A good suggestion for you. You need a holiday.
Speaker 2: It wasn't always like this, You know.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean. We always do the same thing. There's no variety in our lives.
Speaker 1: You need a holiday. That's what's the matter.
Speaker 2: Certainly, Perhaps.
Speaker 1: Yes, I could sing it when I was very young.
Speaker 1: You are not going to give it up, Are you?
Speaker 2: No way. I'll never find another apartment around here. But I don't like the idea of paying three months 'rent on an empty apartment, Either.
Speaker 1: I don't blame you. Perhaps you could sublet it.
Speaker 2: Yes, But whom to?
Speaker 1: Mmm... Let me think. Oh, I know just a person. An old colleague of mine, Jim Thomas, Is coming here to do some research this summer, From June to August.
Speaker 2: That's exactly when I'll be away. It sounds ideal, As long as the landlord agrees.
Speaker 1: Tell you what, I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway, So I'll mention it to him then.
Speaker 2: Well, Thanks, Bill. Let me know what happens. That extra money will really come in handy.
Speaker 1: Wow, This new car is dynamite! It is a shiny, Beautiful car.
Speaker 2: My car is simply a daisy. It drives smoothly.
Speaker 1: The car has very sleek lines. I love it.
Speaker 2: I am glad to hear that. I'm really pleased with it.
Speaker 1: You made a good choice.
Speaker 1: I think you should make a thorough market investigation now.
Speaker 2: Ok, Ok. I'll do my best.
Speaker 1: I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up.
Speaker 2: I know life is not all roses, And I believe I will pull this through.
Speaker 1: Yeah, You can make it.
Speaker 1: And how's your brother?
Speaker 2: He is fine.
Speaker 1: He's going to be sent to Britain to study, Really?
Speaker 2: Yes. He's already got the passport and visa.
Speaker 1: Fantastic! Please send him my congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you. He's very lucky indeed.
Speaker 1: Will they recommend me the class that suits me?
Speaker 2: Sure. You can review the lessons you have learned at school and learn something new there.
Speaker 1: That's great. I'll tell my mother about it.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day.
Speaker 1: What about the weather in Boston?
Speaker 2: I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter.
Speaker 1: Is it very cold in winter?
Speaker 2: Yes, It is. But it's nice in spring and fall.
Speaker 1: You were spying on me, Weren't you? You probably rented those children.
Speaker 2: Why would I spy on you?
Speaker 1: Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well, Or you would not put up that sign just around the corner.
Speaker 2: The entrance to our store is around the corner. And there's no other way of saying that. It's not the name of our store. It's where it is. And you do not own the phrase around the corner.
Speaker 1: What is that? What are you doing? You're taking all the caviar! That caviar is a garnish?
Speaker 2: Look, The reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt. And I was buying them presents. I'm the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative. And there's only one place to find a children's book in the neighborhood. That will not always be the case. And it was yours. And it is a charming little bookstore. You probably sell what 350, 000 worth of books in a year.
Speaker 1: Dad and mom?
Speaker 2: Yeah, They said they're reviving the old tradition.
Speaker 1: You mean this is going to be a regular thing?
Speaker 2: That's right, Once a week. Do you want to order some pizza?
Speaker 1: What are you going to major in?
Speaker 2: I am going to major in tourism. What about you? How long have you been here?
Speaker 1: For nearly four years.
Speaker 2: Well. You should be able to give me some advice on where to stay. At the moment, I am staying in a hotel which is far away from the school.
Speaker 1: They work for Zina now.
Speaker 2: And they're happy with that?
Speaker 1: They're in awe of her. After they saw how she crushed WebTracker... But I guess you know all about that.
Speaker 1: That's because it's time.
Speaker 2: Time for what?
Speaker 1: It's time to make our wedding wish come true...
Speaker 2: You mean get married now? On the plane?
Speaker 1: Why not? I've got the rings ready.
Speaker 2: I don't know what to say, Jack!
Speaker 1: Hopefully, You'll say \"yes\"...
Speaker 1: Will that be all?
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: Do you have your library card?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah. Here you go.
Speaker 1: Will that be all for today?
Speaker 2: That'll be all.
Speaker 1: These books are due back in two weeks.
Speaker 2: Thanks. Have a good one.
Speaker 1: It's not a surprise, Is it? She has always been a hard working student.
Speaker 2: But I think a master degree is good enough for a girl.
Speaker 1: Em, You're right.
Speaker 1: It will be a large church one. Is your wedding dress ready?
Speaker 2: Yes, Its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it.
Speaker 1: You will be very beautiful on your wedding day.
Speaker 2: Thank you!
Speaker 1: Which hotel will the reception be held at?
Speaker 2: The Palace Hotel.
Speaker 1: It's excellent. A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, Though very expensive.
Speaker 2: It will be expensive, But we think it will be worth.
Speaker 1: I think you made the right decision.
Speaker 1: Thank you. My wife would be very happy to hear this.
Speaker 2: She must have done a lot of work on it.
Speaker 1: You bet.
Speaker 1: Great! Work is really busy now, But it's fun.
Speaker 1: It sounds like you weren't expecting that.
Speaker 2: I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend. He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away.
Speaker 1: Well, If you need some money to tide you over until payday, I can loan you some.
Speaker 2: Thanks, But tomorrow's payday I can make until then. Thanks any-way.
Speaker 1: Well, The first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James. Once in the New World, They befriended an native named Squanto, Who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.
Speaker 2: And then what did happen?
Speaker 1: Well, They had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives, Giving thanks the land, And everyone for the foods, Healthy and new lives.
Speaker 2: Interesting! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are!
Speaker 1: Come to my house for Thanksgiving! We are having turkey, Pumpkin pie, Mashed potatoes with gravy, And lots of stuffing!
Speaker 2: Count me in!
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's fabulous. And the neighbors don't even seem to exist.
Speaker 2: That is a relief. It's a good thing we moved.
Speaker 1: Ms. : With a hall pass, You can go to the ladies 'room or wherever you need to go during class time.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Ms. : If a teacher stops you in the hallway, Just show him or her the pass.
Speaker 2: Or else I'll get into trouble.
Speaker 1: Ms. : That's right.
Speaker 1: So, What did you get them?
Speaker 2: I bought a sewing machine. I know that my friend likes making her own clothes, But her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems.
Speaker 1: What's wrong with it?
Speaker 2: She says that after several years of use, It's not working properly. When she uses it, It makes a funny noise.
Speaker 1: Household appliance don't seem to last for a long time nowadays.
Speaker 2: I think it's because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models. Because they know that we will buy the new models, The appliances don't need to last more than five or ten years at most.
Speaker 1: Really? What's the series about?
Speaker 2: Well, It's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America. It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny. I think you'd like it.
Speaker 1: It sounds interesting, But I am not a big fan of TV shows. They're time consuming and don't have much depth.
Speaker 2: I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting. Take this show for example, It examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream, With hilarious results.
Speaker 1: Really? That's interesting!
Speaker 2: Yeah. Oh, Here it comes! Why don't we watch it together? They are going to have a court debate in this episode. It should be good.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'll give it a go.
Speaker 1: Well, No. It can't be that hard! I mean, All you have to do is explain your business, How you are going to do things and that's it, Right?
Speaker 2: You couldn't be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, History, Etc.
Speaker 1: Well, That seems easy enough.
Speaker 2: Wait, There's more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors'? Then comes the hard part, A market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, Where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.
Speaker 1: Geez. Is that all?
Speaker 2: Almost, The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, Cash flow and profits. After all, People will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!
Speaker 1: Umm. I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!
Speaker 1: What do you usually write about?
Speaker 2: At first, I'll write about my life there. Like interesting things on the campus, Travel stories, Special English words that I come across. Sometimes, I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. How often do you write a blog?
Speaker 2: It's random. If there happen to be a lot of things going on, I may add several new entries in a week, And if I've got nothing to share, I may leave my blog untouched for weeks.
Speaker 1: Got it. Are you still updating your blog?
Speaker 2: Sure, Since I came back from the US, I've been keeping the habit of blogging, Simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like.
Speaker 1: Good for you. I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months.
Speaker 1: What's playing at the Century Fox?
Speaker 2: Candlelight in the Window.
Speaker 1: Should we go see it?
Speaker 2: I'd rather not. I don't like horror movies.
Speaker 1: How about ‘ Run of the Mill? '.
Speaker 2: No. I heard that's really boring.
Speaker 1: Why don't we go to a concert instead?
Speaker 2: Great idea!
Speaker 1: I was born here.
Speaker 2: Really? This is a beautiful town.
Speaker 1: It's nice talking to you. But I have to go.
Speaker 2: Ok. Can I have your phone number?
Speaker 1: Ok. It's 15066688866. Call me! Bye-bye, Then.
Speaker 2: I will. Bye.
Speaker 1: I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit, This sure is a nice spring day.
Speaker 2: Hey, This spot in the shade looks really comfortable.
Speaker 1: Okay. Hey, Is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I say the weather report last night, And it said the weather should be fine all day.
Speaker 1: If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend. It's been a while since I've not really gotten some sun.
Speaker 1: A /S / L, IGP, H & K, And ZZZ. What the hell do they mean?
Speaker 2: ZzZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ', A /S / L is tricky, Which is often used at first encounter. It's a three-word question,' age, / sex / location? '.
Speaker 1: Interesting. Then what does H & K refer to? The city of Hong Kong?
Speaker 2: Wrong. Lt's not a place name, But a passionate act.
Speaker 1: Really? What kind? A girl left this word to me, And I thought she was in Hong Kong.
Speaker 2: Ahahah... You miss her point for sure. H & K actually is an acronym for 'hug and kiss'.
Speaker 1: Hug and kiss?! How is it possible? Oh, It's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize.
Speaker 1: So what did you do about it yesterday?
Speaker 2: I went sky-diving!
Speaker 1: You're kidding me! That sounds really scary!
Speaker 2: It was scary, But it felt great, Too.
Speaker 1: Weren't you scared?
Speaker 2: Of course I was scared. But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped.
Speaker 1: So have you cured your fear of heights?
Speaker 2: I think so. After I jumped out of the plane, I realized that I should just enjoy life. Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly.
Speaker 1: I'm impressed.
Speaker 2: Are you scared of anything?
Speaker 1: Well, Sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself.
Speaker 2: What do you think is going to happen?
Speaker 1: I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things.
Speaker 2: It sounds like you just need to be more careful.
Speaker 1: Okay, Let's make a toast.
Speaker 1: What does a CEO do anyway? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company, But what does he actually do?
Speaker 2: He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company. He or she must give leadership to all company officers, As CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company, And acting as official representative, Or face of the company.
Speaker 1: Must be one smart guy.
Speaker 1: I tell ya, When I got the invite, It really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.
Speaker 2: I know. But things have changed. I guess I've settled down.
Speaker 1: I guess so.
Speaker 1: No, But I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger.
Speaker 2: Where are you from?
Speaker 1: I'm from the plains of the Midwest. It's a prime location for tornadoes.
Speaker 2: Did your house ever get damaged from the winds?
Speaker 1: Most of the time we were lucky, But once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room.
Speaker 2: Wow, That must have really been scary.
Speaker 1: Actually, Some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass.
Speaker 2: Have you ever experiences a flood?
Speaker 1: No, But my father's car was destroyed in a flood once. It actually happened the day after he bought the car!
Speaker 2: That sure didn't last long!
Speaker 1: No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a tornado watch. That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.
Speaker 2: I understand. They think a tornado might come.
Speaker 1: Yes. People should look out, Because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a watch.
Speaker 2: And the second stage is called a tornado warning.
Speaker 1: Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, They announce a tornado warning. So if there's a tornado warning on, It means a tornado is out there somewhere.
Speaker 2: It's scary.
Speaker 1: Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, It's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, Then we have to go in the basement.
Speaker 2: What do you mean a loud train?
Speaker 1: That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.
Speaker 2: But if you hear them coming, Isn't it already too late?
Speaker 1: Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.
Speaker 2: Have you seen a lot of them?
Speaker 1: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.
Speaker 2: Did it hit their house?
Speaker 1: No, It didn't. But they are glad I called them.
Speaker 2: What were they doing when you called?
Speaker 1: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, They could have all been killed.
Speaker 2: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?
Speaker 1: Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 1: The delivery people showed up four hours late.
Speaker 2: I apologize for theirtardiness.
Speaker 1: I was late for work because of them.
Speaker 2: Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience.
Speaker 1: I want my money back for the delivery.
Speaker 2: Seeing as they were late, That won't be a problem.
Speaker 1: It shouldn't be a problem.
Speaker 2: I'm going to refund your money right now.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's her.
Speaker 2: I met her last week at a party. Anyway, You must be from the United States?
Speaker 1: Actually I live in London, But my family lives in Seattle.
Speaker 2: Oh, I am from London as well.
Speaker 1: Where in London do you live?
Speaker 2: In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually. Which is very nice because I love tennis.
Speaker 1: I play tennis there every week. Shall we have a game one day?
Speaker 2: That would be lovely. But now let's go and get a drink.
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: We didn't pay attention to the environment, Cut down trees and polluted the air.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things.
Speaker 1: Not at all.
Speaker 2: Be careful of yourself.
Speaker 1: Hmm... I don't know. Even though it may not be gory, I think it would still totally freak me out.
Speaker 1: Are you sure? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?
Speaker 2: Really? You've read books about it? Ok, Then. But only if you want to.
Speaker 1: Ok, Let's see, Well, You've got a long life line, Which is good, And the love line is strong...
Speaker 2: What else do you see? Will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?
Speaker 1: Hmm, Hard to say, Wait, Yes, It looks like you will do well in business, And your ambition will help you a lot, But...
Speaker 2: What? What is it? What's the matter?
Speaker 1: You seem to have a large gullibility line. You believe everything that you're told.
Speaker 2: Hey!
Speaker 1: And when is your son's birthday?
Speaker 2: That is not for a while. His birthday is only in August.
Speaker 1: But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon.
Speaker 2: And when is your birthday?
Speaker 1: Oh, My birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers.
Speaker 2: My birthday is in June, When we are always on holiday. So my family often forgets my birthday too.
Speaker 1: Oh, Photography, It's really a good hobby.
Speaker 2: Yes, I usually develop and print all my own photos.
Speaker 1: You yourself have a photo studio?
Speaker 2: Yes, Simple as it is.T does work.
Speaker 1: When did you buy it?
Speaker 2: Last Saturday.
Speaker 1: Can I see the receipt?
Speaker 2: Yes, Here you are.
Speaker 1: Well, If there is no damage, You can return it.
Speaker 1: You must be joking. You can't fall in love with someone you've never met!
Speaker 2: I know, But I keep thinking of him every day. And I get really depressed when he's not online.
Speaker 1: I think it's just a crush. You can't be serious.
Speaker 2: Well, This might be silly. But I just can't get him off my mind. And I can't help missing him.
Speaker 1: Did you tell him?
Speaker 2: Yes. He said I'm his dream girl.
Speaker 1: You shouldn't take it too seriously. It might be a lie.
Speaker 2: I know. I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice.
Speaker 1: I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends, And then the right person will come along.
Speaker 1: I have a small family. They are my parents, My younger brother and me.
Speaker 2: I thought you were the only child in the family. Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s?
Speaker 1: Yes, It did. But my parents are ethnic minority people. It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children.
Speaker 2: Interesting. What do you think about families with only one child?
Speaker 1: The child must feel very longly. My younger brother is 10 years younger than me. Before he was born, I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da.
Speaker 2: Do you get along well with each other?
Speaker 1: Yes, We are very close. He is 12 years old and very smart. He always makes us laugh a lot.
Speaker 2: You are very lucky to have such a nice family.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 1: But why do so many people live there?
Speaker 2: Most people grow accustomed to the climate, But there are many others who complain about it all the time.
Speaker 1: Are there any cities where it rains a lot?
Speaker 2: Several. Two good examples are Seattle, In the state of Washington, And Portland, Oregon.
Speaker 1: Tell us about some cold cities.
Speaker 2: In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter. Boston and Chicago are two of them.
Speaker 1: Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston?
Speaker 2: Oh, No. On the contrary, There are many beautiful days, Especially in the spring and fall.
Speaker 1: We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.
Speaker 2: I don't agree, But anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself.
Speaker 1: What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It's pointless.
Speaker 2: Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.
Speaker 1: What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.
Speaker 2: Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday!
Speaker 1: Yeah, Yeah, Whatever.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's funny. I thought you liked it.
Speaker 2: I hate it.
Speaker 1: Never mind. It'll be over in 10 minutes.
Speaker 2: It's the worst thing I'Ve ever tried.
Speaker 1: Can I have a look as well?
Speaker 2: Of course, Have a seat.
Speaker 1: Oh, This one looks really good. And look at the garden. So beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yes, Nice. But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof.
Speaker 1: Yes, But my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun. And it has a small balcony at the top.
Speaker 2: Well, You can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda. This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer.
Speaker 1: Talking about a barbecue, Didn't you say you are organizing one next week?
Speaker 2: Yes, Next Saturday. I hope you can make it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me.
Speaker 2: Done. Oh, Don't forget to take napkins, Disposable plates, Cups and picnic blanket.
Speaker 1: That's great. We can also take the dragon kite with us. After the picnic, We can fly it.
Speaker 2: Cool, We can take shuttlecock and badminton racket.
Speaker 1: Okay, It sounds good.
Speaker 1: I see. What about transport? How does Shanghai compare to London?
Speaker 2: Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern.
Speaker 1: And what about the number of people on the streets?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London.
Speaker 1: No, That's not true. Many adults like the Harry potter books too.
Speaker 2: Maybe they don't agree with my taste.
Speaker 1: You must have a wonderful time.
Speaker 2: Yes. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Have you traveled much, Luke?
Speaker 1: No, My wife doesn't like traveling. We haven't been traveling for more than ten years. The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married. We spent our honeymoon in the Alps.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. Yeah. Some people like traveling, Some don't. My husband didn't like traveling at first, Either. He said what's the use of traveling? A waste of money and a waste of time. At last I got him on the move. After all, He loved me. We went to Bali, Indonesia, One of the most beautiful places in the world. That trip left a very deep impression on him. Since then whenever we have holidays and money, We'd like to patronize the travel agency. Isn't it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life?
Speaker 1: Not this Taiwanese girl. We don't like to getsuntans.
Speaker 2: That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer. Hey, There's everybody! We made it!
Speaker 1: Where did you learn to sing like that?
Speaker 2: I was part of a band in school.
Speaker 1: You? Wow. And why don't you ever dress like that at work?
Speaker 2: Come on! This is work. Don't you think that would be a little weird?
Speaker 1: Right on, Right on! Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite! He was low on bread, But Sherry paid for everything.
Speaker 2: Gravy! Jim is such a jive turkey man. He is always hitting me up for cash. Anyway, You wanna book and go grab some grub?
Speaker 1: Yeah man, I'm starving!
Speaker 1: Did you download a movie or rent it at the store?
Speaker 2: I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it.
Speaker 1: Some people believe that a tough approach is better. Other prefer a more lenient approach.
Speaker 2: I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly. If most people have similar amounts of money, They will not think of stealing from others.
Speaker 1: That's possible, But I'm not sure it would really happen like that.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. I had a really good time.
Speaker 2: Thanks for coming! We should meet again sometime soon.
Speaker 1: That would be great! Actually, Can I get your phone number, Ella? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime.
Speaker 2: Anytime. You can reach me 5558929.
Speaker 1: Ok, Got it. I'll call you sometime next week.
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: It's time to go and I hope we can get together again soon.
Speaker 2: I hope so, Too. Bye! Ben.
Speaker 1: No-one really believes gossip columnists.
Speaker 2: I think you'll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns. You'd also have to be very careful about every word you said. If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly, It would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines.
Speaker 1: I think you're right about that. I'd need a good manager to be my spokesperson. I could do a lot of charity work, Which would help a lot of people.
Speaker 2: That's a great idea. Which charities would you support?
Speaker 1: I love children, As you know, So probably a children's charity.
Speaker 2: You'd have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity, So you'd really need to be very careful. Anyway, I'd be the first to buy your posters and I'd attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography.
Speaker 1: Thanks, But actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography.
Speaker 1: You are absolutely right. They are too brief. They don't tell you anything.
Speaker 1: You're right! How are you? It's been a long time!
Speaker 2: What did you do after high school?
Speaker 1: I went straight to university afterwards. What about you?
Speaker 2: I took a year off to go travelling.
Speaker 1: That sounds exciting. Where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went all over the world. It was the best year of my life. Where did you go to school?
Speaker 1: I went to a small school in Connecticut. It has a very good reputation for its languages department.
Speaker 2: Oh, Did you study a foreign language?
Speaker 1: Yes, I got a grant to study Chinese.
Speaker 2: That's a very difficult language to learn, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: It is, But it's very rewarding.
Speaker 2: So you can speak Chinese?
Speaker 1: I can, But not as well as I'd like to. I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die!
Speaker 2: I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well.
Speaker 1: Are you feeling better?
Speaker 2: Yes, It helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work.
Speaker 1: Do you need anything, Grocery?
Speaker 2: Oh, No, I'm fine. My refrigerator is piled up with food. But if it's not too much trouble for you. I'd like something to read.
Speaker 1: Sure, I'll get it for you. Books or magazines?
Speaker 2: I'd like both.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, Do not take naps during the day, And yet they can be so heavy.
Speaker 2: You see, Because we are often busy working, We eat too much fast food, And that food is very fattening.
Speaker 1: Well, It would give me a chance to grow, But I am wondering if I would like the job.
Speaker 2: I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself.
Speaker 1: I am also thinking about the pay.
Speaker 2: Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?
Speaker 1: Yes, It might be worth it. I am not certain.
Speaker 2: I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you.
Speaker 1: What cities did you go to?
Speaker 2: London, Paris and a few other cities.
Speaker 1: Did you go to Berlin?
Speaker 2: No, We didn't go there. I'd like to go there next time.
Speaker 1: I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin. It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice.
Speaker 2: That's what I've heard.
Speaker 1: I went there last year. If you want, I can give you some information I have about the city.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: But it is lucky for us. The company computers don't have software keeping tracks of websites we visit. I have shopped too often online these days.
Speaker 2: Well, Keep a low profile.
Speaker 1: Do you think he can do well?
Speaker 2: A new broom sweeps clean anyway.
Speaker 1: Oh, Right. My geography isn't very good!
Speaker 1: No problem. See you!
Speaker 2: See you!
Speaker 1: What does a clerk do?
Speaker 2: He works in an office. He writes letters and reports, And he types.
Speaker 1: I want to be a vet.
Speaker 2: A-what?
Speaker 1: A vet-a veterinary surgeon.
Speaker 2: Good gracious! What's that?
Speaker 1: A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals. He's an animal doctor.
Speaker 2: I once read a story about a person who talked to animals. It was very interesting.
Speaker 1: Ok. What are the biggest cities?
Speaker 2: The biggest city? The biggest city is Sydney, Then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth. But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia. And Perth is on the west coast, But sort of of out there by itself.
Speaker 1: Ok. Um, If you had to live in one place where would you live?
Speaker 2: I like Brisbane. I had my teenage years in Brisbane, Growing up in Brisbane, Um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city, But Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine.
Speaker 1: Oh, Nice. Actually, What is the capital city of Australia?
Speaker 2: Ah, Canberra is the capital city. But is not the biggest city. Sydney is the biggest city. Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded. It's a separate territory.
Speaker 1: Yes, I understand.
Speaker 2: The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th. Is someone coming to get you?
Speaker 1: No, I don't have a ride yet.
Speaker 2: We will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p.M. Any more questions.
Speaker 1: How much will the trip cost?
Speaker 2: I put all of that information in the packet. I'll give you another copy if you need one. See you on Monday!
Speaker 1: Where did you go to university?
Speaker 2: My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing, But I decided to go back to England. I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication.
Speaker 1: What is your current occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a journalist. I write for China Daily.
Speaker 1: Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate?
Speaker 2: What a good idea. I'm quite hungry.
Speaker 1: Me too. I feel very thirsty as well.
Speaker 2: Let's go then.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know I'm wrong. But I swear that the affair lasts only for two months. And I still love my wife. I couldn't live without her.
Speaker 1: Yes, I swear.
Speaker 1: Ok. But can I trade my seat with you? I prefer the one near the window. I'm a terrible flyer. I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed.
Speaker 2: That's fine. I'd like to be on the aisle anyway. It's easier to get in and out.
Speaker 1: Thanks. Where shall we put our luggage?
Speaker 2: I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment, And the others can go under the seat.
Speaker 1: Good idea.
Speaker 2: Don't forget to keep the seat belt on.
Speaker 1: Ok. Hope it's a pleasant trip.
Speaker 2: Yes!
Speaker 1: And no hijackers.
Speaker 2: Oh, You have too wild of an imagination.
Speaker 1: I only watch now.
Speaker 1: What kind of job are you looking for?
Speaker 2: I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field.
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant?
Speaker 2: No. Is it difficult to find such a job?
Speaker 1: Not if you are good at net-working. Do you like to meet new people?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'm pretty out-going and friendly.
Speaker 1: Do you have experience in the IT field?
Speaker 2: I have some. I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain.
Speaker 1: Do you speak Spanish?
Speaker 2: Yes, But not fluently.
Speaker 1: That's OK. Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet?
Speaker 2: I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me.
Speaker 1: Did you write a clear objective in your resume?
Speaker 2: No, Because I didn't know what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: I think you need to update your CV. Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it.
Speaker 2: Thanks, I will. I'll see you tomorrow then!
Speaker 1: What does she teach?
Speaker 2: English, Of course.
Speaker 1: Is she your teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes. She teaches our class three times a week.
Speaker 1: Can she speak Chinese to her students?
Speaker 2: Not very much.
Speaker 1: It's a good thing you can speak English!
Speaker 1: So do you! How are you doing?
Speaker 2: Not bad. Let's find a table and sit down. We have a lot to talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay, Let's sit over there.
Speaker 1: Yes, I really weak in maps, I did poorly in high school.
Speaker 2: That's a problem.
Speaker 1: How did you like it?
Speaker 2: It's fantastic.
Speaker 1: Where did you go there.
Speaker 2: I went to there on business.
Speaker 1: And do you have friend there?
Speaker 2: Yes, A lot of friends.
Speaker 1: You must enjoy yourself.
Speaker 2: Yes. And I took many pictures.
Speaker 1: Good?! For them but not to me.
Speaker 2: So, What's the problem?
Speaker 1: We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend. You know, After work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed. And during the Weekend, You just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner.
Speaker 2: Yes, You are right. But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity. Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning, Analysis and judgement.
Speaker 1: Yes, I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend?
Speaker 2: Yes, You are right. I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss.
Speaker 1: Well, What if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii? Does that perk your interest?
Speaker 2: Now you're talking.
Speaker 1: The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype.
Speaker 2: Because you can see the results with the general public?
Speaker 1: That's right. I think we all have much we can learn from each other.
Speaker 2: I would buy that kind of book!
Speaker 1: Oh, I learned that he is also a legendary violinist.
Speaker 2: Absolutely right. He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto. That caused a sensation. The audience were stunned by his pure tone.
Speaker 1: Obviously you did enjoy the concert.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Have you bought a burial plot and a casket?
Speaker 2: No. Wendy is being cremated. She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried. I already chose a cremationurn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.
Speaker 1: I see, That sounds like something she would have really liked. I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful. You are doing a great job.
Speaker 2: Thanks, It hasn't been easy, But luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.
Speaker 1: Wow! I'm impressed!
Speaker 2: How about you?
Speaker 1: I quit my job as a food critic.
Speaker 2: Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate.
Speaker 2: I don't know the reason.
Speaker 1: When?
Speaker 2: Ten days ago.
Speaker 1: Could Dr. Cole like to attend the party?
Speaker 2: Yes, He will.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in?
Speaker 2: Sure. I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first.
Speaker 1: Ok. This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder. Why don't you see if you like the way it feel?
Speaker 2: It's very light. That would be good. How is the battery life?
Speaker 1: It's got an above-average battery life. It lasts uptp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes.
Speaker 2: Can you also take still photos with this?
Speaker 1: Yes, That is an option.
Speaker 2: How about night vision? Can you use it in the dark?
Speaker 1: Yes. I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark.
Speaker 2: That's not bad at all. How's the microphone? Does it pick up much sound?
Speaker 1: It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera.
Speaker 2: How does that compare with other models?
Speaker 1: There are models that can pick up more sound than this one, But they're much bigger and heavier than this one.
Speaker 2: I guess you can't have everything, Can you?
Speaker 1: Did you hear the names he was calling me?
Speaker 2: I heard. But did you have to tear out his nose ring?
Speaker 1: How about Thursday?
Speaker 2: Yes, Thursday would be fine. What time shall I come?
Speaker 1: Oh, About 6:00. Will that be OK?
Speaker 2: Yes, Of course. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: See you on Thursday, Then.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you.
Speaker 1: You are smart.
Speaker 2: Of course, The sports shoes don't go with the formal occasions.
Speaker 1: You are right. What kind of shoes should I wear?
Speaker 2: The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers.
Speaker 1: Good idea. Oh, By the way, Would you please pick me up after the party, Honey?
Speaker 2: It'll be too late ; you'd better take a taxi.
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 1: Come on! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \\'d pick you first. �.
Speaker 2: What? Come on! That's just lame! No girl would fall for that!
Speaker 1: Fine, Then you can say, � So there you are! I'Ve been looking all over for YOU, The woman of my dreams! �.
Speaker 2: That's a good one! I think that's pretty funny.
Speaker 1: Yeah, So you make her laugh, You make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.
Speaker 2: Ok, How does this sound, � I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes. �.
Speaker 1: Nice! Let's go!
Speaker 1: I guess I'd buy that...
Speaker 1: I only paid two dollars for mine.
Speaker 1: Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money.
Speaker 1: You mean you've never had a boyfriend?
Speaker 2: My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college.
Speaker 1: Until college?
Speaker 2: Actually, That's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids.
Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I'Ve decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, It's just that I'Ve been smoking since I was sixteen, And I think it's time to stop.
Speaker 2: I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing?
Speaker 1: One last thing, I'Ve decided to come out of the closet.
Speaker 2: It's about time!
Speaker 1: Don't worry, Do it step by step.
Speaker 2: I feel I really stupid.
Speaker 2: Well, That's my opinion.
Speaker 1: I admit that she is much prettier than Kate.
Speaker 2: Oh, There is no comparison. Now we are talking but ugly.
Speaker 1: At least we agree on that. Let's go and get a drink.
Speaker 1: Have you ever swum in a river or a lake?
Speaker 2: Yes, But not always. However, I won't let it go if I have a chance.
Speaker 1: You can't compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them, The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.
Speaker 2: Well, You are right on that point. This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.
Speaker 1: At least you're doing your part. My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.
Speaker 2: As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, It's fine.
Speaker 1: We aren't sure yet. Maybe L. A. I think L. A. Would be the best idea.
Speaker 2: Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U.S.?
Speaker 1: Yes, The recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything. Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff. It's going to be good. We can compete more directly with them.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: Our computers have a high level of quality now. We can demonstrate it. And our prices will be good. So I think it will really be worthwhile.
Speaker 2: You seem excited about it.
Speaker 1: Well, You know I studied marketing in America. So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me. I'd love to be part of the team.
Speaker 2: Do you honestly think we can compete though? All the computer giants are there.
Speaker 1: Yes, I do. I think we can compete. I think we can make a name for ourselves. It will be hard at first. But if we develop a good advertising campaign, I think we can break into the market.
Speaker 2: The company will have to choose a good advertising firm. And then there's the problem of quality. How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good?
Speaker 1: It takes some time. Because even if the quality is high, People won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name. Name recognition is crucial.
Speaker 2: Well, I hope it all works out, John. I think if you're part of the team, Things will go well. But you know we'd all miss you here. So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving.
Speaker 1: That's very nice of you to say. But if we set up an office there in the States, Maybe you could try to become part of it.
Speaker 2: Me? No way. I'm dedicated to the company, But I'm not going to leave Taiwan. I'm happy here.
Speaker 1: Two meters? That means that the high jump bar is above his head! Are any of them good at long-distance running?
Speaker 2: The longest race we run is the 1500 meters. A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes.
Speaker 1: How are they at swimming?
Speaker 2: They're ok. I ask them to swim 500 meters each day. That's 20 lengths of the swimming pool. They're not very fast, But that's ok. I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape.
Speaker 1: Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters.
Speaker 2: I'd be afraid to jump from that height!
Speaker 1: I think that these kinds haven't learnt to be afraid yet. She started diving from a lower height, But she soon wanted to go higher.
Speaker 2: It seems that they really enjoy to go faster, Higher and further.
Speaker 1: What about your brother?
Speaker 2: He's not quite 25.
Speaker 1: Do you miss your family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you often go home?
Speaker 2: No. But I write to them often.
Speaker 1: How often do you write to them?
Speaker 2: Once a month.
Speaker 1: Wow! What a hit!
Speaker 2: Yeah, He tackled him so hard his helmet came off.
Speaker 1: Is he ok?
Speaker 2: It looks like it, He's getting up.
Speaker 1: I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team.
Speaker 2: The Giants?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Here we go again.
Speaker 1: What happened? Why did everyone get so quiet?
Speaker 2: The Redskin's quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points. We're losing again.
Speaker 1: That's right. He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected.
Speaker 2: And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights.
Speaker 1: He had great vision, Didn't he?
Speaker 2: And humility. I would have liked to meet him personally.
Speaker 1: Do you have any breaks?
Speaker 2: We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1. We can take coffee breaks during the day. My boss doesn't mind, As long as we get out work done on time.
Speaker 1: My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks. I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork, Doesn't it?
Speaker 2: There's some paperwork, But most of the time we put any information onto computers. Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network. Do you work in a cubicle?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do. I don't like it very much.
Speaker 2: I work in a cubicle too, But I I don't mind it.
Speaker 1: Fine, Thanks. I'm having several friends over for dinner this Saturday. And I was wondering if you have the time to join us.
Speaker 2: Sounds good. What time do you want me to come?
Speaker 1: Is six o 'clock okay?
Speaker 1: Let's not go there, Joanne! Ok, So let's start with the record collection, I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.
Speaker 2: Fine, But I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.
Speaker 1: I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne. And you hardly ever use it!
Speaker 2: He's my grandfather, And he never really liked you anyway!
Speaker 1: Whatever! Alright, I'll concede the silly gramophone, If you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.
Speaker 2: How typical, When are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What's next? What about these old photographs?
Speaker 1: Which ones? Let me have a look. Wow, Look at that! That brings back memories... That?
Speaker 2: Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trev fountain, And we got caught in the rain...
Speaker 1: ... And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, Smiling and laughing in the rain...
Speaker 2: Oh, We really did have fun back then, Didn't we?
Speaker 1: Oh, Joanne, Are we making a big mistake? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again? I still love you.
Speaker 2: Oh Jeff! I love you too! I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.
Speaker 1: The motorcycle? But that's mine!
Speaker 1: You got up so late today. You have, I think. Turn on the TV and set your watch by it.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll turn it on.
Speaker 1: All right. It's just four o'clock.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm setting my watch at four. Thank you.
Speaker 1: You are welcome.
Speaker 1: I'll get my things and meet you there.
Speaker 2: Good. If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it! Just come at five.
Speaker 2: I make a mean potato salad!
Speaker 1: Well, If you insist, You are welcome to bring a potato salad!
Speaker 2: Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five! Thank you!
Speaker 1: You can do it right now, If you'd like.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Please fill out this application.
Speaker 2: Then what do I do?
Speaker 1: I just need to take your picture.
Speaker 2: How long will it take for my passport to be ready?
Speaker 1: You will get it in a few weeks.
Speaker 2: That's perfect.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: You gotta have some better deodorant.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?!
Speaker 1: I don't want to argue anymore. Please get out of my life!
Speaker 2: I think we can still talk.
Speaker 1: No way! Please don't follow me around.
Speaker 2: Talk it easy, Anna. You really don't hate me. Do you?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do. Leave me alone!
Speaker 1: Well, The weather is so unpredictable this time of year.
Speaker 2: You're right. We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Look! It looks as if it is going to rain.
Speaker 2: The weatherman predicts a fine day today.
Speaker 1: The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast.
Speaker 1: Does 6 thirty suit you?
Speaker 2: It suits us fine. We'll see you then.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Goodbye.
Speaker 1: Carl won the gold in the 100, 200, Long jump, And 4x100 relay in 1984.
Speaker 2: I like the way Carl runs. He looks more graceful.
Speaker 1: Then when do you think we could go out together?
Speaker 2: How about Friday? Only in that day can I arrange it.
Speaker 1: Ok. Any time on Friday will be OK with me.
Speaker 2: That's settled then. I'll contact you later.
Speaker 1: I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway. Is that her?
Speaker 1: I got your meaning. Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks.
Speaker 2: Correct! What about you, Fred?
Speaker 1: I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired. I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste.
Speaker 2: Don't overdo it.
Speaker 1: Shall we have a drink someday?
Speaker 2: I get drunk easily.
Speaker 1: Is the weather usually like this here?
Speaker 2: It's usually a bit hotter than today.
Speaker 1: What's the weather like in winter?
Speaker 2: It's pretty cold and it often snows.
Speaker 1: I wonder what it's going to be like tomorrow.
Speaker 2: Let's hear the weather report later. What's the weather like in your hometown?
Speaker 1: Neither too cold, Nor too hot.
Speaker 2: That's quite a lovely weather.
Speaker 1: Yes, Especially in spring.
Speaker 2: Have you ever seen a hurricane?
Speaker 1: Once, When I was a child.
Speaker 2: Do they often happen in your country?
Speaker 1: Now and then.
Speaker 2: Oh, It's time for the weather reporter. Let's turn on the TV.
Speaker 1: I know all the tricks of the trade. It is quitetiring and difficult to be promoted.
Speaker 2: Maybe. But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience. What about you?
Speaker 1: I am a reporter at a TV station.
Speaker 2: Do you like your job?
Speaker 1: Yes, I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15, 000 $ a year.
Speaker 2: Which kind of news do you catch?
Speaker 1: I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades.
Speaker 2: Are you feel tired?
Speaker 1: Sometimes. News happened out of expectation. Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing.
Speaker 2: You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter.
Speaker 1: That's right. I am still wet behind the ears.
Speaker 1: Is it a two-pin socket?
Speaker 2: Yes, It is.
Speaker 1: Good, I'Ve get a two-pin plug.
Speaker 1: A match made in heaven.
Speaker 1: What about restaurants and entertainment?
Speaker 2: There are restaurants with food from all over the world. We have a small china-town near the city centre. There are many Indian, Thai, And Italian restaurants all over the city centre. There are manys.
Speaker 1: Is there a lot of nightlife in your city?
Speaker 2: There are several good clubs near the city centre. Many people in my city prefer something more cultural, So we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas.
Speaker 1: It sounds like a really exciting city to live in.
Speaker 2: It is. I hope you'll have time to come for a visit soon. You really should come during the summer, When the weather is better and there's more happening outdoors.
Speaker 1: You lose face by refusing to drink, And the host might think you refuse to give him face. The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up. This will endear you.
Speaker 2: A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night, Crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood.
Speaker 1: Then he must be opening his heart to the friends. In a word, As long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort, No one will jeer at you.
Speaker 2: I got you. Next time. I'll preface a toast with a statement like 'I can't drink any more' and then drink anyway.
Speaker 1: That's really a shame. By the way, Who will be the bridesmaid?
Speaker 2: Julie's friend, Mary. And John will be the best man.
Speaker 1: Wow! I'm very excited about your ceremony.
Speaker 1: Oh! I just drop in on him for a chat.
Speaker 2: Please come in for a cup of coffee.
Speaker 1: No, Thank you. Please tell him to phone me when he comes back.
Speaker 1: I'm always interested in how, But seldom pay much attention to who.
Speaker 1: I'll get my things and meet you there.
Speaker 2: Good. If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong.
Speaker 1: You're serious?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm serious. I'm really sorry about missing your concert.
Speaker 1: I guess I misjudged you. I hope you can forgive me.
Speaker 2: Of course I forgive you. What are friends for? Now, What am I going to do for that other guy?
Speaker 1: Autumn is also very nice In Washington.
Speaker 2: Is it very cold in winter there?
Speaker 1: No. It isn't. But sometimes it slows a lot in winter.
Speaker 2: Does it rain a lot in summer there?
Speaker 1: Oh. Yes. Sometimes it rains very heavily.
Speaker 2: How about here in Beijing?
Speaker 1: There's a lot of rain in summer. But it seldom rains in autumn.
Speaker 2: I feel it's rather dry here.
Speaker 1: That's true. Many people from the south don't like the whether here.
Speaker 2: Are you from south?
Speaker 1: No. I'm from the north. I was born in Beijing actually.
Speaker 2: I see. So this is your hometown?
Speaker 1: Dark blue.
Speaker 2: How old is she?
Speaker 1: Twenty.
Speaker 1: I've been great. What about you?
Speaker 2: I've been good. I'm in school right now.
Speaker 1: What school do you go to?
Speaker 2: I go to PCC.
Speaker 1: Do you like it there?
Speaker 2: It's okay. It's a really big campus.
Speaker 1: Good luck with school.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: You are unfair to her. She is a very nice girl.
Speaker 1: Of course. I have lots of best friends.
Speaker 2: How many best friends do you have?
Speaker 1: I think about twenty-five.
Speaker 2: Hmm. I have only one best friend.
Speaker 1: I feel sorry for you.
Speaker 2: I have only a few friends.
Speaker 1: You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you.
Speaker 2: That's very nice of you.
Speaker 1: All right, Open your eyes. ( Rose opens her eyes. She stretches her arms, And Jack stands behind her, Arms around her. ).
Speaker 2: I'm fling, Jack. ( singing ) Come, Josephine, In my flying machine. Up she goes, And up she goes...
Speaker 1: Yeah. It won't be much, But at least we'll have a monthly check when we get old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive.
Speaker 1: Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it.
Speaker 2: Really? No, They couldn't. None of them would have jobs if they did.
Speaker 1: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Yeah, It was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, But here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.
Speaker 1: Sure, You still have my contact details, Right?
Speaker 2: You know what, This is really embarrassing, But your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me?
Speaker 1: Sure, My name is Ana Ferris. Don't worry about it, It happens to me all the time. I'm terrible with names too.
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in something like that?
Speaker 2: Well, The minister at my church told us about it, And it seemed interesting. I thought I'd try it once, And if I didn't like it I'd stop.
Speaker 1: So what do you do there?
Speaker 2: It's simple. All we do is prepare some food, Usually sandwiches and some fruit, And give it out to them at the soup kitchen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, It sounds easy. How long does it take?
Speaker 2: Only about two hours, For a couple of days a month. Why don't you give it a try?
Speaker 1: I don't know. I mean, I like helping the community and all that, But I don't know if I have the time...
Speaker 2: Come on, It's easy, And it'll make you feel good. Why don't you come with me tonight?
Speaker 1: Nothing?
Speaker 2: Not a sound on the city streets, Just the beat of my own heart, I think that's how it goes, Something like that.
Speaker 1: You and Patricia got engaged, Didn't you? You can tell me.
Speaker 2: Engaged?
Speaker 1: Come on.
Speaker 2: Are you crazy?
Speaker 1: What? I thought you liked Patricia.
Speaker 1: It must be a unique experience. I'm looking forward to share your story when you come back.
Speaker 2: Ok, I will bring you photos as many as possible.
Speaker 1: I guess. Are you sure you're taking care of yourself?
Speaker 2: I'm fine, Mom. Remember Holly? This is her roommate, Yi-jun ...
Speaker 1: I'm sure of that. There's enough food here to feed an army!
Speaker 2: That birthday cake looks wonderful, But you haven't put any candles on it yet.
Speaker 1: Thanks for reminding me. I'Ve prepared some party games for the children too.
Speaker 2: I'Ve brought a tape with lots of children's songs on it.
Speaker 1: Hopefully, That will keep everyone happy.
Speaker 1: There's a concert tonight. Would you like to go and listen to it?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. I'd love to.
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: Not a chance.
Speaker 1: Not even for an hour?
Speaker 2: Sorry, It's impossible.
Speaker 1: She married Jerrod.
Speaker 2: You're kidding.
Speaker 1: She's going to live in Paris.
Speaker 2: Really? I'm surprised.
Speaker 1: By the way, Would you like to see movies?
Speaker 2: That's OK.
Speaker 1: What do you do in your spare time?
Speaker 2: I like to play golf, Play badminton or crack jokes.
Speaker 1: I just like to sleep like a lazy cat.
Speaker 2: That's a bad habit.
Speaker 1: I can hardly wait!
Speaker 2: Do you know the day they plan to open?
Speaker 1: I'll double check the announcement.
Speaker 2: Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time?
Speaker 1: Fine, I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area, Food there is pretty spicy too. Shall we try that one?
Speaker 2: Ok with me. You are the boss. I will meet you downstairs after work.
Speaker 1: What's up?
Speaker 2: My manager jumped on me for my mistake today.
Speaker 1: You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing.
Speaker 2: I think I'm too clumsy. I can do nothing well.
Speaker 1: You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done.
Speaker 2: But I doubt myself.
Speaker 1: Cheer up! Don't let me down. We all make mistakes, And that is life.
Speaker 1: Now, Close your eyes. ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand. ).
Speaker 2: A silk scarf. I love it. Thank you very much. My lovely son.
Speaker 1: Happy Women's Day. I love you forever, Mum.
Speaker 1: Really? Thank you.
Speaker 1: Pretty good. What brings you here?
Speaker 2: I came to see my uncle. He lives in the next block.
Speaker 1: Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college. Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated?
Speaker 2: I am going to be a, Well, I hope to be a research chemist.
Speaker 1: How old is he today?
Speaker 2: It's his 50th birthday.
Speaker 1: Well, Wish him a happy birthday for me.
Speaker 2: Sure thing. What are your plans for the evening?
Speaker 1: I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight.
Speaker 2: Well, If you can wait until tomorrow night, I'll go with you then.
Speaker 1: Sorry, I've got people coming over tomorrow night.
Speaker 2: Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us.
Speaker 1: Sounds that way. Maybe some other time then?
Speaker 2: Sure. Hey, I'm sorry, But I've got to get going.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Me, Too. It's about time I made a move.
Speaker 2: Say hello to your friends for me.
Speaker 1: Likewise. See you later.
Speaker 2: Bye!
Speaker 1: Is this your first time in Beijing?
Speaker 2: Yes. My company has an office here, And I have just been transferred.
Speaker 1: Here is my phone number. If you need anyone to show you around, Call me.
Speaker 2: Great. I would like that.
Speaker 1: Ah thank you! I'm very excited. We were going to get married next year, But then we decided to get married on holiday instead. It was wonderful.
Speaker 2: That sounds so romantic! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, But we had to postpone our plans. We just don't have the money!
Speaker 1: I know what you mean. I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive, Don't you?
Speaker 2: I sure do. In my opinion, It's actually becoming more expensive than back home.
Speaker 1: Definitely. Oh, There's Mr. Campbell. Driver, Can you stop here please?
Speaker 1: Wow! Anything else?
Speaker 2: This one comes with its own folding keyboard. It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program. I can use the stylus to write on the screen.
Speaker 1: What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies?
Speaker 2: Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go!
Speaker 1: You mean you're going to ask her out in a note? You big chicken!
Speaker 2: I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in person.
Speaker 1: But, You work with her everyday.
Speaker 2: That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, When I even think about asking her out, I get tongue-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red.
Speaker 1: You've dated a lot. What's so different about Diana?
Speaker 2: Well, For one thing, She's gorgeous. She's so upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together. But, What if I'm wrong. Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh... Forget it. This was a bad idea.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess you don't want this note, Then.
Speaker 2: What note?
Speaker 1: I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night.
Speaker 2: You're kidding! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything.
Speaker 1: Sorry. What can I say? Now, Do you want the note or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I want the note.
Speaker 1: Have a great time tomorrow night.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I plan on it.
Speaker 1: Not possible.
Speaker 2: Maybe, There was a subway accident.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: A train got trapped underground with him inside.
Speaker 1: And no phone.
Speaker 2: And you know, How those express trains create suction.
Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?
Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?
Speaker 2: He didn't say, But he said he would call me.
Speaker 1: Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!
Speaker 2: Oh, David. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What should I do if he doesn't call me?
Speaker 1: Come on, Mary, You're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry.
Speaker 2: Thank you, David. You're always so encouraging.
Speaker 1: That's what friends are for.
Speaker 1: Yes, But they are used for other things, Too. Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris.
Speaker 2: Yes?
Speaker 1: The man asked where we want to go, Then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply. A few moment later, He gave us two tickets.
Speaker 2: Of course, His machine must have been connected to a computer.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 1: He's after your own heart, It is important.
Speaker 2: So he will make a perfect husband. Make sure you will be here next Monday.
Speaker 1: I promise!
Speaker 1: Do you like it?
Speaker 2: I love it! Darling, You're kind.
Speaker 1: No no, I just changed my eating habits. I eat a balance meal. And I eat less than before.
Speaker 2: Good for you, Keep it up.
Speaker 1: You know, Just giving me lots to do. I'm really busy right now.
Speaker 2: Are you? What are you busy with?
Speaker 1: Oh, Lots of things. Mostly training new people.
Speaker 1: The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.
Speaker 2: Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.
Speaker 1: I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I'm gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.
Speaker 2: Well, Let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.
Speaker 1: Actually, Would you mind looking after my pettarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?
Speaker 2: Hehe .. sure.
Speaker 1: It would probably be very expensive.
Speaker 2: I think the government can afford it. Besides, There are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement.
Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don't seem to have enough money to educate kids properly.
Speaker 2: If we are to invest more money to education, We will need to raise taxes. That wouldn't be popular with voters.
Speaker 1: Most voters what everything bout ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, But without increasing taxes.
Speaker 2: The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.
Speaker 1: Yes. The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly.
Speaker 1: And the necklace, It matches your dress marvelously.
Speaker 2: It's very nice of you to say so. I should say you are glamorous yourself, As a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: Thank you for saying so.
Speaker 1: I've always wanted to go to Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top?
Speaker 2: That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them?
Speaker 1: Sure. What's this one a picture of?
Speaker 2: Oh, That's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city.
Speaker 1: You don't look very happy in that picture.
Speaker 2: No, By that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had had enough of art galleries, Cathedrals, Fountains, Statues, And palaces!
Speaker 1: So what did you do?
Speaker 2: We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market. We had a few coffees, Watched a movie, And went for a swim in the pool at the hotel.
Speaker 1: My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Louvre?
Speaker 2: Of course! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though.
Speaker 1: That's what everyone says! I can't wait to see it for myself some day.
Speaker 1: Cindy told me about you in our gym class.
Speaker 2: I see. Do you live in this neighborhood, Too?
Speaker 1: My house is next door to yours.
Speaker 2: Oh, Cindy did mention you before. You're Alexander Newman.
Speaker 1: Just call me Alex. Alex and Alexander are the same thing.
Speaker 1: What do you do on that day?
Speaker 2: We'll have ricedumplings. What's more, There are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 1: It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week.
Speaker 2: I think you are absolutely right. Actually, My father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks. They got married a month later.
Speaker 1: If you were to take on a double major, What would be your first choice?
Speaker 2: I think with International Business a language would be appropriate.
Speaker 1: Have you even thought that far ahead? I mean what country would you like to do business with?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I would like to work in South America. So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work.
Speaker 1: I know, But I've done that so Ay times. It's getting old. The leading guy is always the same macho A.
Speaker 2: I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A.
Speaker 1: Next time. You are going to love your part. I've seen the script.
Speaker 2: I do a good old lady. I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, That's fine.
Speaker 1: Well, I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms. Anyway, It is all worth, Just think about the cool evening time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, History, What about you?
Speaker 2: I'm in the car business.
Speaker 1: Salesman?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's right.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, By the way, My name's Mary.
Speaker 2: Nice to meet you, I'm jimtaylor.
Speaker 1: And what is your call regarding?
Speaker 2: I'd like to talk to her about my accommodation situation.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'll try and put you through. Please hold.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: ... Sorry, Her line is busy at the moment. Can I take a message?
Speaker 2: Sure. Can you have her call me back on my cell phone number?
Speaker 1: Ok. What's your number?
Speaker 2: It's 0-7- 7-8- 7-3- 6-7- 6-8- 8.
Speaker 1: Let me repeat that back to you. That's zero, Double seven, Eight, Seven, Three, Six, Seven, Double six, Double eight.
Speaker 2: No, There's no double six at the end of the number. It's just zero, Double seven, Eight, Seven, Three, Six, Seven, Six, Double eight.
Speaker 1: I got it. When should I have her call you back?
Speaker 2: Anytime before 6 pm tonight.
Speaker 1: Ok, Nathaniel. I'll have Ms. Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6 pm.
Speaker 2: Thank you!
Speaker 1: Bye!
Speaker 2: Bye!
Speaker 1: So, Since when is your house a bank?
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: I mean, What's up with the locks and iron bars on your windows.
Speaker 2: Security, Dan, Security! You can never be too safe you know! A lot of sickos out there. Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window.
Speaker 1: What's the matter with you? Why are you acting all paranoid?
Speaker 2: Paranoid? I'm not paranoid! I'm cautious! You see Dan, We have to be on guard at all time! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you! Telemarketers, Solicitors, Even your bank! They have way too much information! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.
Speaker 1: Ok, Well, What did you want to see me about?
Speaker 2: You are being watched! Be careful Dan! Be careful!
Speaker 1: And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?
Speaker 2: Forgive me darling. I'm very tired.
Speaker 1: Great! Work is really busy now, But it's fun.
Speaker 1: How about a snack after work?
Speaker 2: I couldn't careless.
Speaker 1: Would you rather stay home?
Speaker 2: Whatever you say.
Speaker 1: Are you really interested in doing something?
Speaker 2: I don't mind if you want to.
Speaker 1: Can a handset case be changed?
Speaker 2: Of course. That's why I bought this type. I can change its case frequently, So it is novel to use it.
Speaker 1: How many cases are accessible?
Speaker 2: There are two more, One is orange and the other is pink. I have bought them all.
Speaker 1: It's really going to be fresh all the time.
Speaker 1: Not only that. The job I'm doing now is the most boring job you can imagine.
Speaker 1: Yes, Please do that.
Speaker 1: Yes, You are right. I like the song in the movie, Edelweiss, Do you remember it?
Speaker 2: Of course, It is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant.
Speaker 1: Those young actors play the roles perfectly.
Speaker 2: I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie. Have you bought the tickets?
Speaker 1: No, I am asking you whether you will go to see it.
Speaker 2: Let's go. We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering if you like to go to the theatre then.
Speaker 2: That's sounds great.
Speaker 1: Ok. How about give me a ring, Then?
Speaker 2: No. I'd better not.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because I don't think my husband would like it. Thank you for inviting me anyway.
Speaker 2: I decided to put him up while he's here, Big mistake!
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: He's lazy. I tried being a good host, But if you give him an inch, He'll take a mile.
Speaker 1: I guess you think twice next time he comes.
Speaker 2: You can say that again.
Speaker 1: So how long has he here for?
Speaker 2: Two weeks. If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming.
Speaker 1: Well, I know you do the right thing.
Speaker 1: No. The Hills? Who filed for divorce first?
Speaker 2: I guess it Is Mrs Hill. She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary.
Speaker 1: Oh, Maybe not. It's just your guess. Do not give currency to idle gossip.
Speaker 2: Ok. I close my mouth.
Speaker 1: Did you think about talking to her again? Maybe she is waiting for your call.
Speaker 2: I have asked for a talk again, But she refused and said she wanted to be quiet.
Speaker 1: Come on, Guy. Maybe she isn't your right person.
Speaker 1: Mr. : Furthermore, When you are dismissed in the afternoon, You will be divided into two waves.
Speaker 2: Two waves?
Speaker 1: Mr. : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time. So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students.
Speaker 2: And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave.
Speaker 1: There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick.
Speaker 2: And?
Speaker 1: So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.
Speaker 2: And it's a brick?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?
Speaker 1: I wanted to. But he said, No, The box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, Other people won't believe it's new.
Speaker 2: So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.
Speaker 1: Yes, It was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products. Look, It even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.
Speaker 2: But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?
Speaker 1: He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.
Speaker 2: Aha! Now I understand. You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk. So, What I think is, You deserve to get cheated!
Speaker 1: C'mon, Don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it. We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.
Speaker 2: That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.
Speaker 1: You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it. How could I fall for such a trick?
Speaker 1: Now that it is all over. Can I go now?
Speaker 2: Not yet. You should stand still for another few minutes. Late-comers must be recorded.
Speaker 1: That's too bad!
Speaker 1: I don't think we are boring. It's just that we don't have any hobbies.
Speaker 2: That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?
Speaker 1: That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, So I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.
Speaker 2: I like to play the piano for fun.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That can be a good hobby.
Speaker 2: Hobbies are great. I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do.
Speaker 1: That's a great idea. I'm going to do the same.
Speaker 1: One thing's certain. If I had a lot of money, I wouldn't work any more.
Speaker 2: Wouldn't you? What would you do with all that spare time?
Speaker 1: As I said, I'd go round the world.
Speaker 2: What would you do after that?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know. It'd take me a long time to go round the world.
Speaker 2: It doesn't sound very exciting.
Speaker 1: Anyway, We haven't won the Pools, And we're not likely to win them. So there isn't much point in talking about it, Is there?
Speaker 2: I'd be happy if I got a rise.
Speaker 1: And my wife would be happy if I bought her amink coat.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for amink coat, So let's come down to earth and have another drink.
Speaker 1: What'll you have?
Speaker 2: I'll have a pint of the best.
Speaker 1: I'd have a Scotch if I were you. We deserve it.
Speaker 2: All right. Make it a double, Will you?
Speaker 1: I like wild animals. I don't like spiders and snakes. I think spiders and snakes are disgusting.
Speaker 2: I'm fond of snakes. I think they're great. I agree with you about spiders though. I think spiders are horrible. I think it's because they have so many legs.
Speaker 1: I think bears are wonderful. Pandas are fantastic. I low the people who kill them for their fur.
Speaker 2: I agree. I'm carry about mice. I think they're so cute!
Speaker 1: Really? I don't see the attraction. I'm afraid of mice.
Speaker 1: They could go out and play with their friends.
Speaker 2: Sure. You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time.
Speaker 1: Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing. He watches too muchTv too.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Remember that if the parents watch too muchTv, The kids will probably follow suit.
Speaker 1: If the new girl is competent, Maybe they will promote her when that time comes.
Speaker 1: Are you using dial-up or broadband?
Speaker 2: Actually, I've got a wireless connection.
Speaker 1: In that case, You need to turn on your airport.
Speaker 2: I hook up to the Internet every day. I can't believe I didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Do you like ever chat online?
Speaker 2: No, But I'd like to. Do you have to pay to do instant messaging?
Speaker 1: Oh, No. You can register for free. Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it.
Speaker 2: What do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them?
Speaker 1: Well, You can always block them. When I don't feel like talking to certain people online, That's what I do.
Speaker 2: What's your email address? I'll add you to my contacts list.
Speaker 1: It's aubreyinchina@yahoo. Com.
Speaker 2: Cool. We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger. Thanks for your help.
Speaker 1: Don't mention it.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere.
Speaker 2: I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, Until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.
Speaker 1: A shouting match? You're so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don't believe it.
Speaker 2: I am not exaggerating at all. I'm telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time.
Speaker 1: Yes, Perhaps. Chinese usually don't notice that sort of thing. Maybe it's quite natural to us.
Speaker 2: Yes, Absolutely true.
Speaker 1: What if there is no chance? I mean what if you don't have a partner, What will you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I talk to myself. That is, I play one role first, Than the other.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. You are really creative.
Speaker 1: No regrets?
Speaker 2: I'm really pleased with it. Thanks.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you're so happy.
Speaker 2: It's super.
Speaker 1: It seems to me that now you're famous. You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties.
Speaker 2: I don't go to parties. The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house. Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in. I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen.
Speaker 1: Then fans don't see you much in public places.
Speaker 2: Yes. I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life. I love what I do and I love how I spend my time, Which isn't in a public place.
Speaker 1: A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts. I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood, That you've watched and thought, 'Well, They've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about.'.
Speaker 2: I've never had one person that I'd idolized. The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering. I don't really know who I would compare myself to. I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people. A little bit of everything, Really. I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet, And I've definitely found my weaknesses.
Speaker 1: Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities?
Speaker 2: It depends. In some poor, Underdeveloped areas, Children's education is a problem. Many kids cannot afford to go to school.
Speaker 1: Oh I see. That's nice. Did you meet your husband at work?
Speaker 2: No, We met at university.
Speaker 1: That's great. Can you do it anywhere?
Speaker 2: No. You can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection. There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city.
Speaker 1: So, What programs do you have on your laptop?
Speaker 2: I'Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs.
Speaker 1: I know you are keen on photography. It's very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera. Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone, Anywhere, At anytime!
Speaker 2: It's wonderful, Isn't it? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently?
Speaker 1: Fine today, Though a bit under the weather last week.
Speaker 1: Don't, Don't, Don't, Don't say that. That, That makes it worse.
Speaker 2: What? You don't love me? Me, Either.
Speaker 1: You don't love me?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But we're so right for each other.
Speaker 2: I know, I know. Well, Is there some, Is there someone else? Oh, That woman on television, Sydney Ann.
Speaker 1: May I ask where you live?
Speaker 2: Just two blocks away, In that tall building.
Speaker 1: That's it. I live there, Too. I live on the sixth floor.
Speaker 2: My family move in just two weeks ago. We live on the fourth floor.
Speaker 1: It's a small world! May I know your name, Miss?
Speaker 2: I'm Chen Ming.
Speaker 1: How do you do, Miss Chen? I'm Song Mei.
Speaker 2: I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Song.
Speaker 1: Are you going to your office now, Miss Chen?
Speaker 2: No, I'm going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing.
Speaker 1: Why not? I would like to buy some candies. Since there are so many people, I think they must have delicious candy.
Speaker 2: Look at the candy bar over there. It is so colorful and tasty.
Speaker 1: They have lollypops, Chocolate drops, Fruit candy, Mints, Pearbrittles and toffee. They are in different colors and flavors.
Speaker 2: I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything.
Speaker 1: Me too. I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people.
Speaker 2: To be honest, I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat. I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not.
Speaker 1: You are a candy terminator. Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities.
Speaker 2: That is true. Speaking of cavities, I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now. Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home.
Speaker 1: You really can't live without candy.
Speaker 1: I hope it won't be too hot, I can't stand the heat.
Speaker 2: Really. For me too.
Speaker 1: A B plus.
Speaker 2: That's not bad.
Speaker 1: But I should have aced it. I mean I finished the paper so quickly, Thinking it's a piece of cake. But when I knew my result, I was like what? That can't be true!
Speaker 2: Listen, John. I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress, But you really want to give up?
Speaker 1: No, I don't. I just don't know how to handle this. This is my first time, You know.
Speaker 2: I know. Don't worry. Do you know what you should do?
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: You need to blow off some steam. The world is not on your shoulder.
Speaker 1: How?
Speaker 2: Forget about school and exams. Come over to my house and have fun. I have some really good DVDs.
Speaker 1: Thanks. But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight. I have to get an early start in the morning.
Speaker 2: Then go to bed and have a good sleep.
Speaker 1: I guess that's what I need. Thanks. You're being a really good friend.
Speaker 2: Of course I am. Well, Pleasant dreams!
Speaker 1: Thanks, Bye.
Speaker 1: I can't see him. Where?
Speaker 2: Right there.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see him now. Wait! That's...
Speaker 2: Yes, It's Mel Gibson.
Speaker 1: Oh, Wow! It's really him! Who is that woman he's with?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Why don't you go ask for his autograph?
Speaker 1: I can't do that.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: That's it? That's the tradition?
Speaker 2: Well, In fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing.
Speaker 1: I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun.
Speaker 2: You should be there some Christmas Eve.
Speaker 1: I am worried about the meeting this morning.
Speaker 2: Why? I think the meeting went well.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes. But what are you worried about?
Speaker 1: I'm afraid I was too rude.
Speaker 2: Rude? You weren't rude at all, Annie. Why do you think you were rude?
Speaker 1: Well, I maybe talked to Mr. Drummond too directly. I thought I maybe said too much. I don't want him to be angry.
Speaker 2: I understand. But really you weren't rude at all. You said what you thought. I think he appreciates that.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I am new here, And I'm not sure he is used to that.
Speaker 2: You mean because you are a woman?
Speaker 1: Yes. And he is the president of the company.
Speaker 2: Listen, Annie. You shouldn't worry about Mr. Drummond. He is a very good man to work for. He is not sexist at all. He appreciates people for their ideas. And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women.
Speaker 1: I am very happy to hear that, Karen. It's good to know I'm working in such a company.
Speaker 2: I agree with you on that, Annie. I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now. I feel he appreciates his employees for their work, Not their gender. I would never change jobs.
Speaker 1: Good. Thank you for telling me this.
Speaker 2: Any time. If you have a good idea, Don't be afraid to speak up. This is a company that appreciates initiative.
Speaker 1: Isn't there anything else?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: You must have a high IQ score.
Speaker 2: Well, Jerry, Let me tell you a secret.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: My IQ score is slightly above average.
Speaker 1: Seriously? But you are such a genius.
Speaker 2: Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, Perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ.
Speaker 2: You can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, You can also get high marks.
Speaker 1: Oh, Thank you. I'm going to the library, Are you coming?
Speaker 2: Let's go!
Speaker 1: I remember the first time I went. My back was sore, I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt, And my legs would cramp if I walked too fast.
Speaker 2: That's exactly how I feel now.
Speaker 1: It's only like that the first couple of times.
Speaker 2: Ha. There won't be a next time.
Speaker 1: You gotta give it a chance. It's fun after awhile.
Speaker 2: I'll think about it after I start feeling better. Right now, I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding.
Speaker 1: I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up.
Speaker 2: So are you officially a junior now?
Speaker 1: Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, But I took 15 because the price was the same.
Speaker 2: That makes sense. So where is Nicole?
Speaker 1: She dropped out of school completely.
Speaker 2: Really? Why?
Speaker 1: She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, They asked her if she wanted to work full time.
Speaker 2: Wow. She's so lucky. She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job.
Speaker 1: It sounds good now, But I'm traditional. I want the degree, So I wouldn't have accepted the offer.
Speaker 2: Do you know how much they are paying her?
Speaker 1: I don't know. But I bet it must have been a good offer, Or she wouldn't have accepted it.
Speaker 1: When did you begin to smoke?
Speaker 2: I had my first cigarette when I was 17.
Speaker 1: Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?
Speaker 2: Yes. Twice.
Speaker 1: So, What's the problem?
Speaker 2: I drew a blank on the algebra test.
Speaker 1: No kidding! Didn't you study for it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, But nothing was clear during the test.
Speaker 1: That's too bad, Anyway, I'm sure things will turn around next semester.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking of dropping out.
Speaker 1: You can't do that, Jenny!
Speaker 2: I'm dead serious about this, Sally.
Speaker 1: Come on, Let's talk about it.
Speaker 1: Well, Pam Franklin lives next door to us. By the way, Can I go to her house this Saturday?
Speaker 2: Of course. You didn't have to ask me.
Speaker 1: That's what Pam said.
Speaker 2: Just don't stay out too late.
Speaker 1: It's boring, Right?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Do you get much rain during the summer?
Speaker 2: Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area.
Speaker 1: So you should bring an umbrella often.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality. I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay.
Speaker 2: You're most welcome.
Speaker 1: I'm afraid I have to go now. The plane will take off soon.
Speaker 2: Call us as soon as you get home.
Speaker 1: No, It is easy.
Speaker 2: How should I do?
Speaker 1: You just follow me.
Speaker 2: All right. By the way, Do you often dance?
Speaker 1: Yup, Because dance can relax myself.
Speaker 2: It seems a good way.
Speaker 1: Loving to look beautiful is women's nature. In fact, I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today.
Speaker 2: No kidding! Again?! You just went shopping yesterday. You really are a shopaholic.
Speaker 1: Well, I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi. They are too small. I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size.
Speaker 2: Ok. Do you have the receipt with you? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first.
Speaker 1: We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible.
Speaker 2: That's true. I think zoo are a good idea, Because they allow people to get close to animals. I think it's good for kids to see wild animals.
Speaker 1: I agree. I'm an adult and I love going to the zoo. I don't like animals experiments though. I believe that we can do tests in other ways.
Speaker 2: I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced.
Speaker 1: That's good news. The good thing is that most people treat their pets well.
Speaker 2: Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals, But those stories are rare.
Speaker 1: Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals.
Speaker 2: Yes, I have. They do an excellent job.
Speaker 1: But if the tea is good and well prepared, It will do much good.
Speaker 2: What good is it for?
Speaker 1: Not only can it appease one's thirst, But it can also refresh one when tired.
Speaker 2: That's true, But it must not be allowed to stand long.
Speaker 1: Why is it so?
Speaker 2: Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before, It will do you harm.
Speaker 1: How about tomorrow night?
Speaker 2: Ok. What time?
Speaker 1: Is 9:00 PM all right?
Speaker 2: I think that's too late.
Speaker 1: Is 6:00 PM OK?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's good. Where would you like to go?
Speaker 1: The Italian restaurant on 5th street.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't like that Restaurant. I don't want to go there.
Speaker 1: How about the Korean restaurant next to it?
Speaker 2: Ok, I like that place.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. What makes you think that?
Speaker 2: Well, He's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band. And one night last weekend, He came home really late, Way past his curfew.
Speaker 1: Really? What happened?
Speaker 2: He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home.
Speaker 1: I see what you mean. I understand why you're concerned. Have you tried talking to your son about it?
Speaker 2: I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.
Speaker 1: You may be right, But it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life.
Speaker 2: You're right. I should talk to him. Sometimes, It's not easy being a parent. Thanks. It helps to get it off my chest. You're always so easy to talk to.
Speaker 1: I don't know about that, But my door is always open. Stop by anytime.
Speaker 1: Let's fix it at seven o'clock, Ok?
Speaker 2: No problem. However, Maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. I will arrange everything.
Speaker 2: All right, See you tonight.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: Ok great, I'll see you at six.
Speaker 2: Ok, See you tonight! Don't be late!
Speaker 1: Fine.
Speaker 2: It's time to go. Bye, Ella. Hope to see you soon.
Speaker 1: Bye, Jason.
Speaker 1: How time flies! Now you are a college student out of a little girl.
Speaker 2: How is aunty Shirley?
Speaker 1: Couldn't be better.
Speaker 2: How has May been?
Speaker 1: She's been good. She is in grade one in Joy Chain high school. And she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I appreciate your help.
Speaker 1: No, Not at all. It looks really classy on you. Where did you pick that up?
Speaker 2: I got it on sale down at the department store.
Speaker 1: When did you go there?
Speaker 2: I was just there a couple of days ago. You know, You should go down there too. They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale.
Speaker 1: I might just do that. What style of clothes do they have?
Speaker 2: Anything you want. They have both casual and formal styles.
Speaker 1: I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Some of your ties are pretty outdated.
Speaker 1: Well, I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made, So I couldn't afford to buy any new ties.
Speaker 2: Anyways, Are you going to the party tonight?
Speaker 1: Yes, I am. Say, Are you going to wear that outfit to the party?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. It is a little too formal. I'm probably going to wear something more laid back.
Speaker 1: Me too. I will probably go dressed in aT-shirt and jeans.
Speaker 2: I guess that you will really be dressing down.
Speaker 1: That's my style when I'm not in the office.
Speaker 2: Good point. I suppose that we all have our own individual styles.
Speaker 1: Fine, Thanks. I've been busy lately.
Speaker 2: What have you been doing?
Speaker 1: I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month.
Speaker 2: Really? Good luck for them.
Speaker 1: Thanks. And how are your parents?
Speaker 2: They're both very well, Thanks.
Speaker 1: Where are you going now?
Speaker 2: I'm going to do some shopping. Why don't you come with me?
Speaker 1: I can't. I have to meet someone.
Speaker 2: It's been nice talking to you.
Speaker 1: Good-bye. See you again sometime.
Speaker 1: It is at 8 o'clock.
Speaker 2: What time is now? Do you have the correct time?
Speaker 1: I don't know what time it is.
Speaker 2: It must be about 6 o'clock.
Speaker 1: I have to go now. I don't want to be late.
Speaker 2: You won't be late. It's still early.
Speaker 1: Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week.
Speaker 2: And.
Speaker 1: And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday, Fingers crossed.
Speaker 2: That's great news, Jeremy. Congratulations! Anyway, I must get back, But give my regards to your wife Monica.
Speaker 1: I will, Michelle. Speak to you soon.
Speaker 1: I like it, Too. But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music.
Speaker 2: You have good taste in music.
Speaker 1: You will need to pay for the damage.
Speaker 2: How much do I need to pay?
Speaker 1: I'm going to need $ 5. 00.
Speaker 2: That's not too expensive.
Speaker 1: It isn't.
Speaker 2: Here's the $ 5. 00.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: No problem. Have a good one.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Okay. I'll pick you up around 6.
Speaker 1: I'll be ready.
Speaker 1: Yes, I agree with you. I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon.
Speaker 2: It's a good idea. But please be careful when you invest this time.
Speaker 1: Yes, I will. I should learn more from you. After all I am green hand on it.
Speaker 2: If you have any question, You can ask me.
Speaker 1: Ok. My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now. I am leaving.
Speaker 2: All right. Let's chat next time. Bye-bye.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: How long do you have to be there?
Speaker 2: Three days.
Speaker 1: When will you be back?
Speaker 2: On Friday.
Speaker 1: And a white sports car.
Speaker 2: Um, That's good.
Speaker 1: Yes, But he's got a wife and 3 children as well.
Speaker 1: Yes. I think they should just let them fly free, And not try to sell them to foreigners. It is a kind of destruction of nature.
Speaker 2: Well, I agree with you. I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains. I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population.
Speaker 1: Who knows? Hey, I like these jade bears here.
Speaker 2: How much are they?
Speaker 1: This one is 2300 dollars. Maybe I should buy it for my mother. What do you think?
Speaker 2: If you want. Didn't you buy her a small vase already?
Speaker 1: Yes, But she would like this a lot. She likes to collect little things like this.
Speaker 2: Alright. Buy it then. I won't buy anything. Well, Maybe I'll buy some Cognac.
Speaker 1: Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother. He always drinks it.
Speaker 2: Let's go ask about it.
Speaker 1: Well, It is not going to happen so soon, I guess.
Speaker 2: You won a lottery? Don't beat around the bush, Just tell me, Please.
Speaker 1: Ok, I lost 5 pounds.
Speaker 1: Thanks. I really appreciate it.
Speaker 1: I see. I'm sure you'll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.
Speaker 2: Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday.
Speaker 1: Are you a member of his fan club?
Speaker 2: I was, But then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, So I'm not a member now.
Speaker 1: Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month?
Speaker 2: Of course! I bought two copies.
Speaker 1: Two copies? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of, Right?
Speaker 1: What would you like for lunch, Pork, Mutton or beef?
Speaker 2: I think mutton is best.
Speaker 1: What kind of drink do you like most, Red wine, Beer or champagne?
Speaker 2: I like champagne.
Speaker 1: And among apples, Oranges and bananas, Which is your favorite?
Speaker 2: Banana of course.
Speaker 1: Do you always have meals outside or in your house?
Speaker 2: I always have meals outside, Because I'm not good at cooking.
Speaker 1: I like landscapes and still life. You prefer abstract paintings, Don't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. I like painters who use will rather than watercolors. The colors appear richer. What do you think?
Speaker 1: I agree. I prefer oils too. I collect landscapes, But I only have a small collection. You have a small collection of abstract art, Don't you?
Speaker 2: Yes. Good artwork is very expensive nowadays. When I was in china, I bought some calligraphy by famous artists. You should come and see it sometime.
Speaker 1: That would be nice. Can you read the characters?
Speaker 2: I know what the characters on the paintings mean. I think Chinese characters look very artistic. It's said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist's character.
Speaker 1: I think that's true with any of the fine arts.
Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?
Speaker 2: Yes, Please. Thank you for everything.
Speaker 1: No. Can I rent clubs?
Speaker 2: There are clubs for beginners. It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times.
Speaker 1: What kinds of clubs?
Speaker 2: Like the seven-piece set. It's only $ 120.
Speaker 1: I'll buy a set. But you have to teach me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, So he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, Then?
Speaker 2: Right now he speaks mostly English, And he can say a few Chinese words. But he will learn in the future.
Speaker 1: What does he look like? Can people tell?
Speaker 2: Yes, People surely can. He's whiter than the Chinese kids, And his hair is a little blonde. My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though.
Speaker 1: Yes. I appreciate all help and in particular, All the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here.
Speaker 2: Don't mention it. I am pleased to help you.
Speaker 1: If there's anything that I can help you in the future, Please let me know.
Speaker 2: I'll do that. Thank you. Have a safe trip home.
Speaker 1: What section does it have?
Speaker 2: Let me see. There's the news section, The entertainment section, Sports, Business, And world affairs.
Speaker 1: What's in that section?
Speaker 2: World affairs? They look at the most important stories in more detail. I find it fascinating. Do you buy a daily paper?
Speaker 1: I buy a national newspaper sometimes, Buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper. I find the local news more interesting than national or international news.
Speaker 1: Sounds easy. But how can I apply to practice? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill. But I am afraid our boss will turn me down.
Speaker 2: Ok, As John after Kennedy put it, Let us never negotiate out of fear, But let us never fear to negotiate.
Speaker 1: My children would like that ; they like dancing very much.
Speaker 2: That's good!
Speaker 1: Look! Who is that guy on the stage?
Speaker 2: Oh, My God! That's my husband, Benjamin.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: He likes American Idol very much, And he always imitates the contestant at home. I can't believe he got on the stage himself.
Speaker 1: He performs very well. He is so funny!
Speaker 2: Ok, Just ignore him. I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community. After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family!
Speaker 1: Ok, That's perfect! By the way, Is there any playground in our neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, There is one behind our building. And you can play tennis there. But if you want to play tennis there, They will change you 30 Yuan per hour.
Speaker 1: Ok, Got it! Thank you so much. You have helped me a lot!
Speaker 2: You are welcome! We are neighbors!
Speaker 1: I've heard of that one. It was also his swan song.
Speaker 2: Besides, Speaking of classical music, We should never forget about the New Year's Concert.
Speaker 1: Of course not. People all over the world watch it on TV, Or listen to it on the radio.
Speaker 2: Sure. It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events. Have you ever been to the live show?
Speaker 1: Yes, I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005.
Speaker 2: Wow, You are so lucky. I saw that one on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall.
Speaker 1: That's for sure. You know, It's really amazing to be in the best concert hall, Listening to the performance by the best orchestra. I had the greatest time ever.
Speaker 2: Who was the conductor at that event?
Speaker 1: Lorin Maazel. He did an amazing job. Moreover, He just celebrated his 75th birthday.
Speaker 2: So cool. I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future.
Speaker 1: The right opportunity for you would come along soon. You know, Music is transnational.
Speaker 2: I believe in that. Well, The performance is about to begin. Let's be quiet.
Speaker 1: Where is it located?
Speaker 2: You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left?
Speaker 2: Last time I checked, It was pretty empty.
Speaker 1: What time was it when you went up there?
Speaker 2: That was earlier this morning.
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be full right now, Would it?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: We need to say something about the geography and climate of china. Is there any way to divide the country into sections?
Speaker 2: We could divide into five parts. There's the northeast, Which is mild in summer and very cold in winter. Then there is the northwest, Which is largely desert.Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate. The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts. One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer. Then, In the south it is hot most of the year.
Speaker 1: That sounds very general.
Speaker 2: It is, Buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation. We can select cities from each part and give data for each one.
Speaker 1: One from each part? Lhasa, Urumqi, Harbin, Shanghai, And hongkong. The capital city is Beijing, Right?
Speaker 2: Yes. The other large cities are Chengdu,Dalian, Wuhan,Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing. Hongkong and Guangzhou.
Speaker 1: We should take a large map and highlight those cities. What is each of them famous for?
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.
Speaker 2: I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, Find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, And that the place is hygienic.
Speaker 1: Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!
Speaker 1: No, It's not going to be George. I don't think it's Andy either. He is involved with the boss's sister in-law. And you know how whipped our boss is.
Speaker 2: That's true. What about Lisa? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her.
Speaker 1: Lisa? No way. I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair. You know rumors can't come out from nowhere.
Speaker 2: Well, Okay. Then there is still Michael. But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row. It definitely won't be Michael.
Speaker 1: No, That would be crazy. But then who will it be? Oh dear, It must be me. I should have known it! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing. What should I do? I've got a familyt.
Speaker 2: Well, It could be me too. But I am not too worried. This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning. It would almost b.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll have a try.
Speaker 1: Nancy, I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight.
Speaker 2: Too sudden! I'm not ready for it.
Speaker 1: Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments.
Speaker 2: Stop it. No more of that talk.
Speaker 1: I really love you.
Speaker 2: No, I shall faint.
Speaker 1: And I hope so. This is what you were meant for. Say you love me, Say yes, Say yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your knowledge of English is really surprising.
Speaker 2: Oh, It's nothing to speak of.
Speaker 1: No, Seriously. I am impressed.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I appreciate the compliment.
Speaker 1: Good for you. Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world.
Speaker 2: Also some traditional Chinese food, Like noodles anddumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality. I heard this year, The government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control.
Speaker 1: For sure all the customers will benefit from this.
Speaker 1: Gotta go. Call me tonight.
Speaker 2: Okay. Check you later.
Speaker 1: We're identical. I mean, We look exactly the same, But we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else.
Speaker 2: Interesting. It must be great having a twin sister. Are you best friends, Too?
Speaker 1: We used to be really close, But that all changed once she moved to Shanghai. How about your family? You didn't mention to your biological father.
Speaker 2: I don't know much about him. He died when I was just a baby. Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother, I consider them to be my real family.
Speaker 1: What about your step-brother's mother? Does he keep in touch with her?
Speaker 2: No, She also died when my step-brother was little. My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends. They ended up getting married a few years later.
Speaker 1: Sounds like it was meant to be.
Speaker 1: Yes, And I want to have a try.
Speaker 1: What's he doing?
Speaker 2: He's fixing his roof.
Speaker 1: Ok, Let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight. Don't be late.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: ( After watching the movie. ) Are you crying?
Speaker 2: I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie.
Speaker 1: Tragic movie? I think it's a love story.
Speaker 2: But their love is touching!
Speaker 1: Ah, You're just too emotional.
Speaker 2: I am not!
Speaker 1: Do you like playing table tennis?
Speaker 2: Yes, I like. But I can't play it well.
Speaker 1: Are indoor sports popular?
Speaker 2: Basketball and swimming are very popular.
Speaker 1: Really? I like playing basketball, Too.
Speaker 2: We can play together if you are free.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 1: You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are, Don't you?
Speaker 2: Well, No-that is, I've heard Linda say they do, But... Thank you. But please don't speak to me again.
Speaker 1: Oh, Miss Anna! That's too hard! I won't be here long.
Speaker 1: Yes, There are. They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries.
Speaker 2: The coast of your country is very varied. The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches.
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound too bad. Great for sunbathing! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers. There are cliffs, Then sandy beaches. Then rocks. There are lots of caves in the cliffs. There are also many small islands off the coast, But few people lives on them.
Speaker 2: There are many lakes and rivers in your country too. We also have many rivers, But only a few lakes.
Speaker 1: We also have waterfalls in the mountains. They make the landscapes look very scenic. The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion, Especially by water.
Speaker 1: It must be interesting to study English.
Speaker 2: Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss. Parker says that my pronunciation is very good.
Speaker 1: Is English pronunciation easy or difficult?
Speaker 2: Sometimes it's difficult. Some words look different from the way one pronounces them.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 2: Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?
Speaker 1: I'll make it up next week.
Speaker 2: Fine, But it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class.
Speaker 1: Ok, I can do that.
Speaker 2: Remember that you are in college now, Not high school.
Speaker 1: I think it looks gorgeous.
Speaker 2: You think it looks nice?
Speaker 1: I honestly think it looks great.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I'm glad that I did a good job.
Speaker 1: How much is it for my hair?
Speaker 2: Just give me $ 55.
Speaker 1: Thanks for doing such a good job.
Speaker 2: No problem, Girl friend. I'll see you next time.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk?
Speaker 2: Yes, But there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk.
Speaker 1: How about the shelf?
Speaker 2: I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it?
Speaker 1: Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go.
Speaker 2: I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing?
Speaker 1: Cheer up! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week. There is no need to write a new one. Oh, What's this? Is this your dissertation?
Speaker 2: Let me see. Yes, That's it. Where did you find it?
Speaker 1: You'Ve put it among these journals.
Speaker 2: My poor memory. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: You're a good student. I'm sure you can do well. What you need to do is to relax.
Speaker 2: You're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time?
Speaker 1: Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress.
Speaker 2: I don't really have time to learn anything new. I need to spend my time studying!
Speaker 1: You need to take some breaks throughout the day. Studying all day isn't very usually effective.
Speaker 2: You're right. I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class.
Speaker 1: Besides, It's not difficult to learn yoga. In fact, I can teach you a move that's supposed to help you fall asleep! You just have to sit down like this, Bend over and breath in deeply.
Speaker 2: That's fantastic. I'm going to go try that out in my room now. Good night!
Speaker 1: Good night, Sleep tight ; don't let the bed bugs bite!
Speaker 1: Yeah. They're usually this big.
Speaker 2: The craftsmanship is excellent.
Speaker 1: All the parts work.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much.
Speaker 1: Don't mention it.
Speaker 2: A barrel of fun, Of course. He often says that I'm a date bait.
Speaker 1: If you want something manly, Stick with the espresso.
Speaker 2: Thanks, Hugh. I owe you one.
Speaker 1: Don't mention it. You know, We're old friends.
Speaker 2: Anyway, I owe you one. Are you free tonight?
Speaker 1: Yes. Why?
Speaker 2: I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook.
Speaker 1: That's great. I'd love to.
Speaker 1: And I was glad to receive your letter.
Speaker 2: Then when will you be back again?
Speaker 1: I will be back again next Wednesday.
Speaker 2: I hope to see you at that time again. Bye.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: Exactly!
Speaker 1: I'll tell him. Thanks for asking about him.
Speaker 1: I like the Brazilians. They are the real champions.
Speaker 1: Really? How do you know it was Santa?
Speaker 2: Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings, So I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies. I even left out some milk. I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, So I came downstairs!
Speaker 1: Hmm... Well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree, Spying on him!
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Really! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed. That way, We can let Santa do his job. Then when you wake up, It will be Christmas already!
Speaker 2: O-K...
Speaker 1: Hey, Honey! Is that you? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some, Too!
Speaker 1: Yes. Don't you?
Speaker 2: Of course I do!
Speaker 1: Which class are you working on right now?
Speaker 2: I'm studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Are you in Mrs Green's class?
Speaker 2: Yes. Are you?
Speaker 1: Yes. We must have the same exam tomorrow!
Speaker 2: Do you want to study together?
Speaker 1: Sure. This library is too quiet though.
Speaker 2: Do you want to go to and empty classroom?
Speaker 1: That sounds good.
Speaker 2: Ok. Let's go!
Speaker 1: Is your helmet comfortable?
Speaker 2: Not really, But I liked the design, So I got it.
Speaker 1: Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better.
Speaker 2: I'll think about it.
Speaker 1: Is that your new bicycle?
Speaker 2: Yes, My father gave it to me for my birthday. Do you like it?
Speaker 1: It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive!
Speaker 2: Nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky.
Speaker 1: I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it?
Speaker 2: Well, My saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?
Speaker 1: That's easy. It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle.
Speaker 2: Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike?
Speaker 1: It's possible. Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality.
Speaker 2: Thanks for coming.
Speaker 1: How about next time we meet at my place? And I'll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise.
Speaker 2: Great idea. I'm looking forward to it. See you then.
Speaker 1: Well. I really do have to go.
Speaker 2: Good night then.
Speaker 1: See you tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I need to come to grips with his death first. And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow.
Speaker 2: Ok, But don't forget I'm here for you, And I know how you feel. It's my loss, Too.
Speaker 1: Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned! That may be true, But if you were to do it, You would have trouble on the horizon. You always say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, You never look at the positive side of things.
Speaker 1: Okay. Have it your way, But don't say I didn't warn you.
Speaker 2: Yeah! She could do anything she wants to me!
Speaker 1: I bet. Why not go over and talk to her? She's really nice.
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I get so nervous talking to girls. I always put my foot in my mouth, Scare her off, And end up looking like a real fool. Besides, She is way out of my league.
Speaker 1: Come on! Man up! You'll never know until you try.
Speaker 2: Okay okay, Just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game.
Speaker 1: All right. But I think you ought to move soon.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: I can see five other guys eying her up.
Speaker 2: Okay, Here I go!
Speaker 1: Good luck!
Speaker 1: Yes, I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad.
Speaker 2: Don't worry about it. Practice makes perfect. I will lend you some listening materials, So that you can practise more before the exam. I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation.
Speaker 1: Oh, Thank you. That's very nice of you.
Speaker 1: I hope so, Too.
Speaker 2: Thanks again for everything you have done for me.
Speaker 1: You're welcome. Have a nice trip!
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts. That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable.
Speaker 1: What was the prize?
Speaker 2: I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice.
Speaker 1: That's a great prize for a person who writes books! Have you ever won a prize before?
Speaker 2: I shared a prize with some friends last week. We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz.
Speaker 1: I won $ 10 in the lottery last month. Perhaps next time, I'll be luckier and win the jackpot!
Speaker 1: Did you have a fight with Jack?
Speaker 2: No, But now he'll be in trouble. What's a boyfriend for? To forget about Valentine's Day?
Speaker 1: Come on, Dear! You forgot it, Too.
Speaker 2: You know, It's OK for a girl to forget these \"big days\", But for a guy, To do that is unforgivable.
Speaker 1: Is that your phone?
Speaker 2: Oh, It's Jack. Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Wow! Good timing.
Speaker 2: He asked me out to a dinner tonight. How about joining us?
Speaker 1: Come on! Three's a crowd!
Speaker 2: So what?
Speaker 1: Just go! It's Valentine's Day!
Speaker 1: Nice. Hey, I like the layout of this page...
Speaker 2: You mean, You like the pictures of the beautiful models... Hello?
Speaker 1: Well. I like the Thom Birds best.
Speaker 2: Is it very interesting?
Speaker 1: Sure. I like the writer's language, Too.
Speaker 2: If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book.
Speaker 1: Would you like to go to the bookshop with me?
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Let's go!
Speaker 1: It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, Oh, And we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.
Speaker 2: Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back, After a short commercial break.
Speaker 1: Oh. That dress doesn't exactly match the job.
Speaker 2: Why? You said my skirt was beautiful just now.
Speaker 1: Yes, Your skirt is really beautiful, But you are applying for a teaching position. You see, Your skirt is very short, And your make up is too thick. What's more, The color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin. As a teacher, You should be a little more sedate.
Speaker 2: Then what should I do?
Speaker 1: Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher, The most important is the beauty of mind. You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance. You should appear frugal and prudent. Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer.
Speaker 1: She was a very controversial leader. Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later?
Speaker 2: There's a lot to see there. Perhaps we should go tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison. Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past. I really want to see the crown jewels too.
Speaker 2: I'Ve seen them before. They're quite incredible. If you want to see historical figures in London, There's one place you have to go.
Speaker 1: Where's that? Oh, I know! MadameTussaud's the waxworks museum.
Speaker 2: There you can see british leaders, Entertainers, Criminals, And royalty.
Speaker 1: Sometimes, It's hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum!
Speaker 1: It wasn't just once. Every single time I take the bus, Something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.
Speaker 2: We could take the subway, But we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.
Speaker 1: Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, Too.
Speaker 2: If we don't hurry up, We'll miss the show. Should we take the bus?
Speaker 1: We're already late, So I think we had better take a taxi.
Speaker 2: I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours. Let's just take the bus.
Speaker 1: Fine. Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives.
Speaker 2: It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. Nothing bad will happen. I'll even buy your ticket for you.
Speaker 2: Thanks, That was nice of you.
Speaker 1: See, Now something good has happened to you on a bus trip!
Speaker 1: He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth. He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth.
Speaker 2: Let me look at the calendar. Good! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday. Is he coming alone?
Speaker 1: No, He's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls.
Speaker 2: Mother, I don't remember the girls. How old are they?
Speaker 1: Your cousin Fay is fifteen. Rosemary is older than Fay. She's seventeen.
Speaker 2: Are they going to stay here with us?
Speaker 1: Of course. The girls can stay in your room with you.
Speaker 2: Mother, May we have a party?
Speaker 1: If you like, But now we have to think about meals and many other things.
Speaker 2: Prepare the list, Mother. I can go shopping. I can go to the small stores. Everyone knows me there.
Speaker 1: It is just pop song, You could have sung there too if you want it.
Speaker 2: Oh, No, It was a kind of pop art. I like it but I couldn't do it that well.
Speaker 1: Honey, Just do it next time. Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia?
Speaker 2: No, But tell me some. I am interested.
Speaker 1: Many oil painting exhibitions are there. That is a kind of Museum Exhibition.
Speaker 2: Are there many people there? Do you think people actually like them?
Speaker 1: I am sure you will. There are some works, And some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors. And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train.
Speaker 2: But I still prefer the pop music in the subway.
Speaker 1: Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts, But with different aesthetic values.
Speaker 2: Dad, You talk well, But can you appreciate that kind of art?
Speaker 1: Not well enough, But I'm learning.
Speaker 1: Let me see. It's not an eagle. I think it's a vulture.
Speaker 2: Yes. Will it hurt us?
Speaker 1: I don't think so. Let's walk by the stream. I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map.
Speaker 2: Ok. I have a good pair of hiking boots. It should not be a big problem.
Speaker 1: I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions. If you are hungry, You can let me know.
Speaker 2: You are kind. Look there is a big tree over there, It looks like a thousand-year-old tree.
Speaker 1: Well, It is a birch tree. It is not as old as you think.
Speaker 2: How do you know?
Speaker 1: Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree.
Speaker 1: I want to know where this relationship is going. I'm in love with you and I need to know...
Speaker 2: You know, I think you're awesome.
Speaker 1: I'm awesome. Well, I guess that's my answer, Isn't it.
Speaker 2: Honey...
Speaker 1: Look, If you don't love me, It's not a thing, Alright, We'Ve had our laughs, But I don't appreciate... Maybe it's just time we...
Speaker 2: Baby, I love you so much.
Speaker 1: You do?
Speaker 2: I love you. And I think you're awesome.
Speaker 1: Oh, I love you too!
Speaker 2: Come on. Put the gun down.
Speaker 1: Oh baby, I'm so sorry.
Speaker 1: That's great. Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now?
Speaker 2: Definitely. I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables, Which is more expensive, But much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them.
Speaker 1: You've really turned into a health nut, Haven't you?
Speaker 2: I guess you could say that. Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy. I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great!
Speaker 1: How do you get enough protein in your diet?
Speaker 2: Well, I eat a lot more tofu, Beans, Nuts and some fish.
Speaker 1: Well, Don't worry about dinner. I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you. Do you like sushi?
Speaker 2: I prefer cooked fish to raw fish, But if you really like it, Make it.
Speaker 1: How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry?
Speaker 2: That sounds great. What time should I come over?
Speaker 1: Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm, So you can come over at 7 p.M.
Speaker 2: Sounds good. See you there!
Speaker 1: He's fine. He retired last week. It's turning going in his life. Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement.
Speaker 2: He can spend more time with his grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world.
Speaker 2: So, He wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea!
Speaker 1: How do you want to spend your old age?
Speaker 2: In the same way, Probably.
Speaker 1: Yes, On a business trip. How about Yuu?
Speaker 2: I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there. Have you ever been there before?
Speaker 1: Yes, I Went there once last summer.
Speaker 2: Really? What did you think?
Speaker 1: I think it is amazing. You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway.
Speaker 2: Was it that crowded?
Speaker 1: Yes. These were always so many people. After taking the subway during the rush hour, You'll envysardines in their cans.
Speaker 2: Oh, Maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. Wish you a great vacation!
Speaker 2: Thank you very much!
Speaker 1: Come on! It is really a fun game.
Speaker 1: Yeah. What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics?
Speaker 2: When the Olympic Games started in modern times, Only summer events were included. When it grew popular, There came the Winter Olympic Games, Which includes a variety of winter sports.
Speaker 1: I see. Then, What's your favorite winter sport?
Speaker 2: Figure skating. In my eye, Nothing beats it.
Speaker 1: Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't expect you to know them. But yes, I love them not only because of many medals they've won, But also because of their spirits.
Speaker 1: You should go to talk with May. She is a big fan of them too.
Speaker 2: Sure. What about you? What do you like about the Olympics?
Speaker 1: For me, The Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart. It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible.
Speaker 2: Hey, Young man, You are so deep today.
Speaker 1: I always am. You just didn't notice.
Speaker 1: Me neither. All I have to do is study French hard.
Speaker 2: I wish you the best of luck.
Speaker 1: Is it serious?
Speaker 2: I can solve it, Thanks.
Speaker 1: How about your family?
Speaker 2: Everything is Okay. And as soon as I see my son at home, All my worries vanish into the blue.
Speaker 1: Why? Do you have to prepare for your examination? Oh, Come on, Girl, Relaxation is also very important.
Speaker 2: That's not the reason. I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening. You know, I've been going there every week.
Speaker 1: Oh, God, I've forgotten it.
Speaker 2: You said you wanted to improve your English, So how about coming with me tomorrow? I can also introduce some friends to you.
Speaker 1: Oh, No, I don't want to know any more geeks like you.
Speaker 2: They are not geeks. They are also interested in singing, Dancing, And so on. They are excellent, And they can always help me a lot.
Speaker 1: Really? Is there a foreign teacher for every class?
Speaker 2: It depends. If they are not busy, They will come to join us, And talk with us.
Speaker 1: So you just talk all the time?
Speaker 2: Of course not. The foreign teachers also teach us English songs, And play games with us.
Speaker 1: That sounds interesting. I'll go with you tomorrow evening.
Speaker 2: You won't be disappointed.
Speaker 1: I'd like to wish you every success in your new venture.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I wish I would.
Speaker 1: Good luck to you.
Speaker 1: What's wrong with it?
Speaker 2: Well, First of all, It needs a new engine, Which is extremely expensive.
Speaker 1: When's the last time you had it serviced?
Speaker 2: It must have been a few years ago now.
Speaker 1: I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.
Speaker 2: They do. Once my son was born, There was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, You know!
Speaker 1: What else is wrong with it?
Speaker 2: The heating controls don't work anymore, So it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer!
Speaker 1: Anything else?
Speaker 2: The brakes don't really work that well anymore either.
Speaker 1: Why don't you get it all fixed?
Speaker 2: It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it!
Speaker 1: Well, Let me know when you can get it fixed. I'd love to go for a ride in it!
Speaker 1: Can I help you pack?
Speaker 2: Sure. Thanks.
Speaker 1: Believe it!
Speaker 2: It looks more like a toy, Or a cool briefcase!
Speaker 1: This city is really comfortable to live in.
Speaker 2: It sure is.
Speaker 1: No other city can match it. It's heaven.
Speaker 2: Well, If you live in other cities as long as enough, You will love them just as much.
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 2: That's for sure.
Speaker 1: Good, Well we can discuss this more then, But I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter.
Speaker 2: Yes, Me too.
Speaker 1: I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference. I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising.
Speaker 1: Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that?
Speaker 2: You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don't be so naive!
Speaker 1: Well maybe you are right, But how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster!
Speaker 2: Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true, Don't you think?
Speaker 1: I'Ve seen it so many times in books, But I never imagined I'd get to see it in person.
Speaker 2: There are tons of other paintings that I think are better.
Speaker 1: Maybe so, But do you have any idea how much this one is worth?
Speaker 2: No, How much is it worth?
Speaker 1: About 80 million dollars.
Speaker 2: Whoa.
Speaker 1: By the way, Could you tell me when the film will begin?
Speaker 2: It will begin at 5 thirty.
Speaker 1: I am frigid I can't be there on time.
Speaker 2: You can see it tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I don't want to miss it today.
Speaker 2: See you.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: I heard one observer even said 'It was a song sung in Spanish for international football, And he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it.'.
Speaker 2: That's right. His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up. He has fan clubs across the world, From America to Russia, From England to Taiwan, From Norway to Australia.
Speaker 1: No no, I just changed my eating habits. I eat a balance meal. And I eat less than before.
Speaker 2: Good for you, Keep it up.
Speaker 1: And he was so young, With so much life to look forward to.
Speaker 2: Yes... Thank you for understanding. We have to go now.
Speaker 1: This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location.
Speaker 1: Oh, Really.Mm! How much is the fare?
Speaker 2: Well, It depends on the journey. It's .. I guess it's not too expensive, But the minimum price you would pay is, For a short journey, Is about a pound.
Speaker 1: Mm, Yeah, Who can you see on the bus? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting?
Speaker 2: Hmm, Yeah, Well this girl here at the back, That's leaning on the door, Um, She looks really bored, Actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go!
Speaker 1: Is that how you feel on the bus?
Speaker 2: Uh, Well, No, Not really, Because I haven't worked in England for a long time, So I haven't taken a bus for a long time.
Speaker 1: So, So you're British, Do you missing them?
Speaker 2: Um, Yes, Sometimes. Sometimes.
Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress.
Speaker 1: I know your feeling. Take it easy.
Speaker 1: Yes, He is. Of course he makes mistakes, But who doesn't.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It's fair to say so.
Speaker 1: Yes, We do.
Speaker 2: The performance is excellent.
Speaker 1: It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great.
Speaker 2: I couldn't agree more.
Speaker 1: Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert?
Speaker 2: Yes, It is.
Speaker 1: Do you have concert halls in your city?
Speaker 2: Yes, But it's much smaller.
Speaker 1: Well, We'd better get back to our seats. It's about to start.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sounds like fun. I can wear my new pink bikini.
Speaker 2: There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are.
Speaker 1: Who cares! Well, The smart guys get there early. That's the kind of guy I want to meet. Let's go!
Speaker 2: If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini, Then I want to wear one, Too.
Speaker 1: Ok, You could borrow one of mine.
Speaker 2: Thanks, How about the green and black one?
Speaker 1: No problem. Here it is.
Speaker 1: How nice. I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week. I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend.
Speaker 2: Not a good plan. The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend, And the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees.
Speaker 1: What a nuisance! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping, A storm comes along. The sky gets dark, The wind starts to howl and the temperature drops. Well, I'd better stay home.
Speaker 2: I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning. Then after listening to the weather temperature, I make my plans.
Speaker 1: That's smart. I'm going to start doing the same thing.
Speaker 1: Is your helmet comfortable?
Speaker 2: Not really, But I liked the design, So I got it.
Speaker 1: Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better.
Speaker 2: I'll think about it.
Speaker 1: Is that your new bicycle?
Speaker 2: Yes, My father gave it to me for my birthday. Do you like it?
Speaker 1: It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive!
Speaker 2: Nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky.
Speaker 1: I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it?
Speaker 2: Well, My saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?
Speaker 1: That's easy. It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle.
Speaker 2: Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike?
Speaker 1: It's possible. Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Sir. Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage, At twenty kilograms each, Plus one piece of carry-on luggage. I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.
Speaker 2: What? Why! I am taking an intercontinental flight! I'm flying sixteen thousand CMS! How am I supposed to only take two, Twenty kilo bags? That's absurd!
Speaker 1: I am sorry, Sir, There's nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that large bag either. Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big.
Speaker 2: Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, But when it comes to charging for any other small thing, You charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, Miss, How much will I have to pay for all of this.
Speaker 1: Let's see... Six hundred and twenty-five US dollars.
Speaker 2: That's more than my round-trip ticket!
Speaker 1: What's he doing?
Speaker 2: He is an accountant. I have been helping him for a week.
Speaker 1: He must be happy.
Speaker 2: Yeah. How are you these days?
Speaker 1: Fine too.
Speaker 1: Well, I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work.
Speaker 2: Maybe you're right.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy yourself?
Speaker 2: Very much. New York is such a nice place. Shall I show you some photographs?
Speaker 1: Thanks, I like looking at photographs. How nice! Oh, I'm afraid I must be going now. I've got an appointment. Have a good day.
Speaker 2: You too. I hope to see you soon. Goodbye.
Speaker 1: Goodbye.
Speaker 1: You're not nervous, Are you?
Speaker 2: I'm very nervous.
Speaker 1: Why are you nervous?
Speaker 2: I'm not going to know anybody there.
Speaker 1: That's not a problem.
Speaker 2: That makes me nervous.
Speaker 1: It's fun meeting new people.
Speaker 2: I didn't think about it that way.
Speaker 1: It's so nice and quiet in the woods.
Speaker 2: Yes. Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere. We counted over twenty squirrels.
Speaker 1: It sounds wonderful. Did you take lunch with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, We boughtveal sandwiches. We stopped around twelve, And we ate and watched the squirrels, But it was too windy to sit long. It was a very nice walk, Anyway.
Speaker 1: Anyhow, This dress is really elegant.
Speaker 1: You mean you didn't know much English then?
Speaker 2: Right. I only knew a few English sentences.
Speaker 1: That's incredible. Could you tell me what you did to make a start?
Speaker 2: First, I worked as a servant.
Speaker 1: Really? I wish you could tell me more about your experience.
Speaker 2: I'd like to, But I must run to a meeting.
Speaker 1: You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information. What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media?
Speaker 2: Well, These mediums are still important... They aren't a thing of the past... But I think they might be less important now than in the past. The technology age has arrived!
Speaker 1: I've got the correct change already.
Speaker 2: First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars have to be smooth.
Speaker 1: Ok, What next?
Speaker 2: Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again.
Speaker 1: Ok, Next?
Speaker 2: Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.
Speaker 1: I agree with you.
Speaker 2: Hope that works for you!
Speaker 1: The pain is killing me.
Speaker 2: I told you to wear running shoes. But you don't listen.
Speaker 1: I thought leather shoes will do just as well.
Speaker 2: Hold on, Don't move, I will take care of that.
Speaker 1: What are you going to do?
Speaker 2: I will get some ice, And put it on your ankle. How does that feel?
Speaker 1: God! It's freezing!
Speaker 2: Be brave. Don't worry. You will be able to walk soon.
Speaker 1: Jeez, Seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.
Speaker 2: It can be hard, And there are certain sacrifices you have to make.
Speaker 1: Like what? I assume that there's no privacy.
Speaker 2: That's one. Another is the lack of personal property. Everything you have, From toys to clothes, Is used by your brothers and sisters. Especially clothes. Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs.
Speaker 1: And the age gap is also annoying. There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.
Speaker 2: Same problem here. There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.
Speaker 1: Well, At least going to college won't be too bad. Since both of your parents are college professors, They must give you reduced tuition at the college.
Speaker 2: They do, But it doesn't help too much. Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight.
Speaker 1: I think it was about 45 minutes long.
Speaker 2: But it went by fast. It was interesting.
Speaker 1: I liked it.
Speaker 2: I'll give you a speech like that, Too.
Speaker 1: Do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: I think only the family will be there.
Speaker 2: You have lots of friends. They will be there, Too!
Speaker 1: Sure. What time?
Speaker 2: The film will start at 2.
Speaker 1: Sounds good. Where and when will we meet?
Speaker 2: In my parking lot, At 2pm.
Speaker 1: All right. See you then.
Speaker 1: When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist?
Speaker 2: I'm not going to tell her. She will find out and understand when she grows older.
Speaker 1: Maybe. I know I agreed to go with you, But now I don't feel right about it.
Speaker 2: Listen, Ryan. Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church. You don't have to pretend to be Catholic. It's okay if you just come to listen.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes. We are kind and welcoming people. It is not a secret society or something like that.
Speaker 1: Alright. But will we sing?
Speaker 2: Yes, But you don't even have to sing. If you want to sing along, You can.
Speaker 1: I don't know the words.
Speaker 2: There is a songbook. All the words are in the songbook. Many people have to read the words.
Speaker 1: And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine?
Speaker 2: No. That is something only true Catholics do. So if you come to the church as a visitor, You only listen to the service. But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine. Only after someone joins the church, Then they go up for the Eucharist.
Speaker 1: Eu-char-ist? What is that?
Speaker 2: That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine. The Catholics call it the Eucharist.
Speaker 1: It doesn't sound like an English word.
Speaker 2: It's not. It's an ancient Greek word. It means gratitude.
Speaker 1: Alright. Well, I feel more comfortable now. Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor.
Speaker 2: Of course you are. I wouldn't ask you otherwise.
Speaker 1: What class was your favorite then?
Speaker 2: I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific.
Speaker 1: I never took that yet. If that was your favorite, I think I will check it out.
Speaker 1: Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?
Speaker 2: The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost, But others will continue to be used for generation, Even if English continues to be the dominant language.
Speaker 1: Right. All the people who speak Chinese. Hindi, French and Spanish aren't suddenly going to stop using those languages.
Speaker 2: Exactly. The article suggests that those languages will be used, But that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers.
Speaker 1: In that case, I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages.
Speaker 1: Don't you see many people over there? Just on your left.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see them. Some are doing Taijiquan, Some are performing swordplay, Some are practising the Chinese Wushu.
Speaker 1: A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China.
Speaker 1: At least more than 100 years old.
Speaker 2: Let's enter it!
Speaker 1: I can't open the door.
Speaker 2: It must be locked.
Speaker 1: Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.
Speaker 2: She can't answer you.
Speaker 1: She must be deaf.
Speaker 2: It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?
Speaker 1: Frightened? You must be joking.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day.
Speaker 1: What about the weather in Boston?
Speaker 2: I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter.
Speaker 1: Is it very cold in winter?
Speaker 2: Yes, It is. But it's nice in spring and fall.
Speaker 1: Why's that?
Speaker 2: Because too many people in the office are on holiday.
Speaker 1: What airline and what flight?
Speaker 2: Pan American Airlines. Flight 282.
Speaker 1: I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P.M.
Speaker 2: Ok. See you tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Nice to meet you.
Speaker 2: Pleased to meet you too. And where are you from, Robin?
Speaker 1: I'm from Kathmandu. What about you?
Speaker 2: I'm from New York. Oh, This is my stop. Bye, Robin.
Speaker 1: Bye. See you.
Speaker 1: Oh, I am looking for an apartment. I prefer living off campus. I can study better.
Speaker 2: I hope you will find a place. Listen, I'd better go. I am going to be late for class.
Speaker 1: Okay, See you around.
Speaker 2: Take care.
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 1: You can call amover.
Speaker 2: How much dose that cost?
Speaker 1: Around 200 RIB for a truck.
Speaker 2: I think it's a little expensive.
Speaker 1: But think about it, You just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers, How much trouble you will save.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I know amover which has a very good reputation for their service. I'll leave you their phone number.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: It's 8357688 8.
Speaker 2: Okay, Thanks a lot. You did me a great favor just now.
Speaker 1: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: How old is he?
Speaker 1: About 30. He's really outgoing. But why do you ask?
Speaker 1: I'd love to, But I'm afraid I can't.
Speaker 1: Do you prefer tall girls or short ones?
Speaker 1: We have different tastes. I like girls with short hair. I like tall girls - probably because I'm so tall myself.
Speaker 2: Have you ever dated a girl taller than you?
Speaker 1: No, Never. I don't think I'Ve ever met a girl taller than me! Have you gained weight recently?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have. Perhaps I should go to the gym, Like that girl's boyfriend.
Speaker 1: I'm getting a bit plump myself. Perhaps I'll go with you.
Speaker 1: Well, I hope you'll feel better soon.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your concern.
Speaker 1: How about languages?
Speaker 2: Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does.
Speaker 1: Um. That doesn't really matter. Because we have more French visitors than German.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. But this isn't a no-smoker, Isn't it? I mean would you mind if I smoke here?
Speaker 2: Actually it is. Perhaps you haven't noticed the sign.
Speaker 1: Sign? What's sign?
Speaker 2: There, On the window.
Speaker 1: Oh, Sorry. I didn't notice it. Sorry.
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service?
Speaker 2: It's really very good.
Speaker 1: Why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Well, Trains are frequent and come on time.
Speaker 1: Which train do you catch in the evening?
Speaker 2: I usually take the five thirty home.
Speaker 1: And can you get a seat?
Speaker 2: No, I usually have to stand.
Speaker 1: Would you agree that the service is fast?
Speaker 2: Yes, It's reasonably fast but it certainly isn't cheap. Fares have gone up 25 present.
Speaker 1: It must be my special touch. I think bargaining is in my blood!
Speaker 2: Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining!
Speaker 1: How come?
Speaker 2: It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected.
Speaker 1: Oh. It's awful, But it can't be helped.
Speaker 2: I'll just have to put up with it.
Speaker 1: I forgot to bring it, But maybe Mary has some. Let's go and ask her.
Speaker 1: But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth.
Speaker 2: I know. If you're sure the truth will do harm, Maybe you can choose not to tell it.
Speaker 1: How do you know that? You haven't got in yet.
Speaker 2: Of course I know. I once attended Lisa's class, Sitting quietly at the back of the classroom.
Speaker 1: Oh, Really? Were you not caught?
Speaker 2: Of course not. You are allowed to attend any lecture, Only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class. In universities, You study in a free and creative environment.
Speaker 1: What do you want to study in the university? Have you thought about it?
Speaker 2: This question has really been bothering me. I like Chinese literature, You know. But economics is really hot now, And it has a very good career prospect.
Speaker 1: I will choose what I like. You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English, Because I don't like English.
Speaker 2: Though I like Chinese literature very much, I'm also interested in economics. It's a tough choice to make.
Speaker 1: You can decide later. You will have choices before you submit your university application form.
Speaker 2: Right. I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision.
Speaker 1: Maybe he is not good at rebounding?
Speaker 2: Indeed, No man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard.Rebounding might not be his strong suit.
Speaker 1: Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics. Did you go to the match between China and USA?
Speaker 2: Who wouldn't! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him.
Speaker 1: Well then, What are your spoils?
Speaker 2: Well, Nothing more than a jumble of photographs.
Speaker 1: You should look it up on our computer.
Speaker 2: I did that.
Speaker 1: What came up?
Speaker 2: It should be on the shelf, But I didn't see it.
Speaker 1: I can try to get the book from a different library.
Speaker 2: I didn't know you could do that.
Speaker 1: I will call you when I find it.
Speaker 2: I appreciate your help.
Speaker 1: I think it is the worst one I have ever seen.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure I agree with you. It was not a good one, But it was not the worst one. Actually, It wasn't too bad.
Speaker 1: I can't think the same.
Speaker 2: What's more, Some scenes were good, Much fit for the children.
Speaker 1: I couldn't agree with you.
Speaker 1: Thanks for telling me this.
Speaker 2: I was late getting back from the mall, But I'm hurrying.
Speaker 1: Why are you in such a hurry? They said, Dinner at eight, And it's only seven-fifteen. I don't want to be the first one there again.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. We won't be the first.
Speaker 1: I hope you'll do better in the final.
Speaker 2: I must, If I want to pass the course.
Speaker 1: I'm going to see a musical. Would you like to come?
Speaker 2: Sure, I'd love to! But let me pay for the tickets this time. It's my turn.
Speaker 1: All right! Thanks!
Speaker 1: Well. If it breaks down again tomorrow, I'll definitely buy a new one.
Speaker 2: Maybe by then it will be too late.
Speaker 1: What do you mean too late?
Speaker 2: By that time, You will be fired.
Speaker 1: Mine isn't hard, But it's not interesting.
Speaker 2: What do you do then?
Speaker 1: I'm a clerk in a shop.
Speaker 1: Do we have it available?
Speaker 2: It wasn't there.
Speaker 1: I guess it is lost.
Speaker 2: Will you be getting another copy?
Speaker 1: Yes, We will.
Speaker 2: Could you reserve a copy for me?
Speaker 1: I can do that.
Speaker 2: That's great. Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, So far, So good.
Speaker 2: Next, You feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are smooth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I already knew that.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, You might have tore-feed it.
Speaker 1: Ok, Let's move on!
Speaker 2: Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, Try again or call the number on the side of the machine.
Speaker 1: I hope it works!
Speaker 2: Well, Good luck!
Speaker 1: Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?
Speaker 2: I would have liked them to be there, But they couldn't afford to fly out to see us, And we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, So they understood.
Speaker 1: Did your husband's family get to meet your family?
Speaker 2: My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown, So that was great. Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions, But we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family.
Speaker 1: That makes sense. Did you go on a honeymoon?
Speaker 2: We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa.
Speaker 1: You really didn't have a very traditional wedding, Did you?
Speaker 2: Not at all, But we don't have a very traditional marriage either, So it suited us perfectly!
Speaker 1: We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.
Speaker 2: I don't agree, But anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself.
Speaker 1: What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It's pointless.
Speaker 2: Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.
Speaker 1: What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.
Speaker 2: Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday!
Speaker 1: Yeah, Yeah, Whatever.
Speaker 1: Did your boat float down the river?
Speaker 2: Yes. There are many places where the gorge is very narrow, With steep cliffs on both sides.
Speaker 1: Sounds dangerous.
Speaker 2: Yes, But we have life jackets. And we got a real kick out of that.
Speaker 1: What a thrilling trip!
Speaker 1: I sure will. Thanks.
Speaker 1: Perhaps you'Ve been working too hard. You do have a high-pressure job.
Speaker 2: Maybe. I haven't been able to keep my food down either. That's unusual.
Speaker 1: Well. I'm sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again. Dr. Jameson is very good.
Speaker 2: Yes, He is. I'Ve make an appointment for 10 o' clock, So I'd better move along.
Speaker 1: Ok. Hope you feel better soon. You should take it easy. I'm sure the doctor will prescribe rest, You know.
Speaker 1: Your two hands hold the pole, Stand on the board, The other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body, Then you can ride in the air. It has a feeling of surfing. You need not let other people teach you. Your fear will disappear quickly.
Speaker 1: Come on, Dear. I know you mustn't forget it.
Speaker 2: It's Saturday, A great weekend.
Speaker 1: Ur, You really let me down.
Speaker 2: Don't be angry with me. I have a bad memory.
Speaker 1: No, You haven't. You just don't care about me. You're an indifferent husband.
Speaker 2: What day is it on earth?
Speaker 1: It's an anniversary of our weeding.
Speaker 1: Come on, Dear. I know you mustn't forget it.
Speaker 2: It's Saturday, A great weekend.
Speaker 1: Ur, You really let me down.
Speaker 2: Don't be angry with me. I have a bad memory.
Speaker 1: No, You haven't. You just don't care about me. You're an indifferent husband.
Speaker 2: What day is it on earth?
Speaker 1: It's the anniversary of our weeding.
Speaker 1: Would you like some more rice?
Speaker 2: No, Thanks. I'm full.
Speaker 1: Another piece of meat pie?
Speaker 2: No, Thanks. I'm on diet.
Speaker 1: How about the dessert?
Speaker 2: Ice cream, Please.
Speaker 1: I thought it was pretty good.
Speaker 2: I can't say I agree.
Speaker 1: You're kidding. The storyline and acting were outstanding.
Speaker 2: I guess I expected too much from the movie, So I was a bit disappointed.
Speaker 1: It might be.
Speaker 1: Well. You know I hate walking, But I can't wait to see your guys' video.
Speaker 1: What did it say about you then?
Speaker 2: For example, The message for the day before yesterday notified me that I, As a Leo guy, Was to have some \"unusual experience in food and drink. And as it turned out, The reality matched this prediction well. Lasi night, I was treated to a dinner party by Mr. Lee.
Speaker 1: But it must have been only a coincidence. That's the only way superstition wins over science.
Speaker 2: Oh, No. You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud. If horoscope is really something deceptive, How come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it.
Speaker 1: For fun. It serves as a shared topic to them. While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their \"accuracy'. They do not necessarily take them seriously. When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences, They delight in spreading the thrill with friends. But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions, They just grin, Forget about them, And go on living as usual.
Speaker 1: It's boring, Right?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Do you get much rain during the summer?
Speaker 2: Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area.
Speaker 1: So you should bring an umbrella often.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's funny. I thought you liked it.
Speaker 2: I hate it.
Speaker 1: Never mind. It'll be over in 10 minutes.
Speaker 2: It's the worst thing I'Ve ever tried.
Speaker 1: We will have our midterm exams next month. I plan to look for some important books and study at the library. Do you want to join me?
Speaker 2: Sure. I need to return some books. They are due today. Besides, I can also read some weekly publications, Magazines and newspapers.
Speaker 1: Great. We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that.
Speaker 2: That sounds like a good idea. We can chill out a little in such a hot summer. Are you good at swimming?
Speaker 1: Well, That's a good question. I haven't swum for almost two years. I think I need more practice.
Speaker 2: Oh, It's almost 9. I need to hurry. I am running late now. See you after class in front of the library then. Bye!
Speaker 1: See you then.
Speaker 1: So you are watching your weight, Aren't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, To tell you the truth. I am on the diet.
Speaker 1: Yep, It should be here by tomorrow night.
Speaker 2: Oh? I heard she dumped you. Anyway, She's right over there. Oh, Sheryl!
Speaker 1: Well, At least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield. They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria. And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense. I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later.
Speaker 2: I agree. Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders, They breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate, Well-timed passes.
Speaker 1: That's why I still have very high hopes for the team. Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage, The Germans will probably make it through to the finals.
Speaker 2: Yes. They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline, Especially in vital, Decisive encounters.
Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.
Speaker 2: You know, I often have to work till late at night. I need something to keep me awake.
Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your advice! I'll try it.
Speaker 1: In the case, Maybe facial charm should be his leading card. After all, The majority of his fans are girls.
Speaker 2: Yes, His face looks are manly, With a straight nose and infinite eyes. As a man of medium height in the West, He keeps a powerful but elegant figure, Looking neither lanky nor stout.
Speaker 1: And he is English! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent.
Speaker 1: Can I read it when you're finished?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping.
Speaker 1: Don't tell me anything about it. I want to read it for myself.
Speaker 2: Okay. But be prepared for an all-nighter! I doubt you will want to put it down either.
Speaker 1: It was always very busy there.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: I stood behind the register and took pizza orders.
Speaker 2: Did you get any perks on the job?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free.
Speaker 1: Look at that cylindrical office building. I'Ve never been seen one that shape before.
Speaker 2: Yes. Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape.
Speaker 1: Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top. They're not perfectly cylindrical.
Speaker 2: This is the world's largest sports stadium. It's a massive oval.
Speaker 1: What sports do they play there?
Speaker 2: It says here that it'sm mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings.
Speaker 1: Is that building a perfect cube?
Speaker 2: According to the book, It is. I'Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube. Look at the building. From the air, It looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides. What.
Speaker 1: Is says here that it's a war memorial. Now, There's a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels. See? It consists of several connected by cylinders. I believe you can go up and down inside it.
Speaker 2: I didn't know you smoked.
Speaker 1: Really? I've been smoking for over a year now.
Speaker 2: Oh. You're new to smoking still. I've been smoking for 7 years.
Speaker 1: You ever tried to quit?
Speaker 2: Many times. I'm really addicted. It's harder to stop than you think.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I tried to quit last month, And I thought it was going to be easy, But it turns out that I'm still smoking.
Speaker 2: I highly recommend you quit soon. The longer you smoke, The harder it becomes to quit.
Speaker 1: I think you're right. Aright. Gotta go to class. Thanks for the cigarette. I'll talk to you later.
Speaker 2: No problem. I'll talk to you later.
Speaker 1: I am. Whatsmore, His wife is 84.
Speaker 2: Is she really?
Speaker 1: Yes, She is. And guess what, He is her sixth husband.
Speaker 2: Really? Quite a woman, Isn't she?
Speaker 1: What were the results of the game?
Speaker 2: It ended in a tie.
Speaker 1: What was the actual score?
Speaker 2: It was three all.
Speaker 1: Really? I thought Barcelona was going to win. They are a much better team than Madrid.
Speaker 2: If Barcelona had played as they normally do, They should have won.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal, But he kept on playing anyway.
Speaker 1: That explains it.
Speaker 2: How many more games are left this season?
Speaker 1: That was the last game before the playoffs.
Speaker 2: When do the playoffs start?
Speaker 1: In a few weeks. Are you planning on watching them?
Speaker 2: Of course! I really love watching football games on TV.
Speaker 1: Me, Too! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together.
Speaker 2: Sure, That would be great.
Speaker 1: Ok, It's a date then!
Speaker 1: Should I take my shoes off?
Speaker 2: We all keep our shoes on indoors.
Speaker 1: Where are your parents?
Speaker 2: They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves.
Speaker 1: That's great!
Speaker 1: Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality.
Speaker 2: Don't mention it. You can come whenever You are free.
Speaker 1: What's the temperature today anyway?
Speaker 2: I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius.
Speaker 1: What would you do at the party?
Speaker 2: We sing \"Happy Birthday\" at the party and have birthday cakes.
Speaker 1: Do you know when people began to sing the song \"Happy Birthday\"?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Let me tell you the story. In 1892, Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called \"Good Morning to you\". But later someone added the words \"Happy Birthday\" to their tune.
Speaker 2: So the \"Happy Birthday\" song has been popular since then?
Speaker 1: Yes, Actually, The song has been sung since its publication in 1932. People all over the world have sung it in many different languages.
Speaker 1: And a white sports car.
Speaker 2: Um, That's good.
Speaker 1: Yes, But he's got a wife and 3 children as well.
Speaker 1: I will. It's most thoughtful of you.
Speaker 1: See you tonight then.
Speaker 2: Yes. Thank you for inviting me.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Ha-ha. I get it. That's funny. Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady.
Speaker 2: She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ”, But she loves them all dearly.
Speaker 1: What are you talking about? I have salads some times.
Speaker 2: Yeah right! I'm serious! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well. You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup! It's really not healthy!
Speaker 1: Fine! I'll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat. Are you happy now?
Speaker 2: It's a start, But I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise!
Speaker 1: Oh, Lovely. Where's the wedding going to be?
Speaker 2: Well .. we're not sure yet, Probably in St. Albans.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes, Your parents live there, Don't they?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's right.
Speaker 1: Where are you going to live after you're married?
Speaker 2: We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London.
Speaker 1: Are you going to give up your job?
Speaker 2: Yes, Probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in.
Speaker 1: You also need to choose a gift for your father, Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Let's go.
Speaker 1: Ok! Let's go.
Speaker 2: ( At the zoo ) Wow! This zoo is really huge.
Speaker 1: Yes, You can find hundreds of various animals here. It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan.
Speaker 2: Look at the map. It has different areas, Such as marine lives, Mammals, Polar animals and insects.
Speaker 1: Where can find the pandas? I think we are here to see the pandas.
Speaker 2: We have to go to the mammal area. We are at the gate right now. We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn.
Speaker 1: It should take at least 20 minutes to get there. Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo?
Speaker 1: Do you mean financially rewarding?
Speaker 2: Well, Many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries.
Speaker 1: I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy.
Speaker 2: Sometimes that's true, But not usually. Most feds are honest, Hard-working professionals. It's hard to keep highly trained people, So the pay and working conditions have to be attractive.
Speaker 1: How much do you make?
Speaker 2: I'm a GS - 15. That's high on the scale of workers, But even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: It's my treat this time.
Speaker 1: Thanks. I could eat a cow.
Speaker 1: And not expensive either.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't care about that.
Speaker 1: Everybody is buying them.
Speaker 2: Are they?
Speaker 1: Yes, They're very fashionable, You see.
Speaker 2: I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But thank you very much all the same.
Speaker 1: Sorry, I couldn't help you.
Speaker 1: Gotta go. Call me tonight.
Speaker 2: Okay. Check you later.
Speaker 1: We should choose from the backups.
Speaker 2: That's right. Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match.
Speaker 1: That's why we should learn to protect ourselves. Otherwise, The game is not worth the candle.
Speaker 2: That's for sure. During the back court, We should change the position we played.
Speaker 1: Yes, I played shooting guard, I like shooting and you'll play inside, Ok?
Speaker 2: I agree with you. I think we'll play much better than before.
Speaker 1: Wow, The cheer-section is coming. The music is so fantastic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Look how passionate they are! Are they professional?
Speaker 1: Well, You should ask your friend. You know I'm not the boss. Just kidding.
Speaker 2: Oops! I almost forget about it. Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line?
Speaker 1: Yeah, What's up?
Speaker 2: Don't you think she looks like your daughter?
Speaker 1: I also have a doubt. Oh, Kill me softly, She is May.
Speaker 1: Wow, A remote car model and my favorite brand. I really like it. That is so nice of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car. It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself.
Speaker 1: Typical you, Always wanting to keep the best things for yourself. The more I appreciate the gift now.
Speaker 1: How was your flight?
Speaker 2: It was OK. There was a lot of turbulence, Though.
Speaker 1: That's too bad. How long was the flight?
Speaker 2: It was 10 hours.
Speaker 1: Did you have a layover?
Speaker 2: Yes, In Paris, France.
Speaker 1: Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores?
Speaker 2: Yes. I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you!
Speaker 1: Oh, You didn't have to...
Speaker 2: It was nothing.
Speaker 1: With Susan leaving, We should probably look to someone new on board.
Speaker 2: Our human resource department is working on it, It's not easy to recruit new employees every few month, It's hard to find qualified people.
Speaker 1: Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people.
Speaker 1: Have you got a new one?
Speaker 2: Mmmm, No. How about you?
Speaker 1: I am single, I have no real of, Only an E-gf, That is you.
Speaker 2: Haha, So you are my E-bf.
Speaker 1: I like you. Do you agree to be my of?
Speaker 2: Mmmm. .. OK, Let's try to be.
Speaker 1: Wow! Blablablabla...
Speaker 2: Hey! What is it?
Speaker 1: I am flying like a bird.
Speaker 2: Ll.
Speaker 1: I am so happy. I want to drink a cup of champagne.
Speaker 2: I have no champagne right now. How about this?
Speaker 1: It's OK, So I send you this.
Speaker 2: Is it made of chocolate?
Speaker 1: It's my heart ; it's made of what you like.
Speaker 2: Oh, I will have a sweet dream.
Speaker 1: Are you sleepy?
Speaker 2: A little bit. I have to go to sleep though I don't want to.
Speaker 1: Yes, I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office.
Speaker 2: Thx. Bye for now. Kisssssssssss.
Speaker 1: C U here, Honey.
Speaker 1: I wouldn't either. It's been looking like rain for several days.
Speaker 1: I think his house is fantastic, But I wouldn't want to live there. You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house, Plus a few people to take care of the gardens, And pro.
Speaker 2: What's your dreamhole like then?
Speaker 1: My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England.
Speaker 2: Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself?
Speaker 1: Old homes are great because they've got character. I think that's important.
Speaker 2: It that why you wear second-hand cloths as well? Because they've got character?
Speaker 1: No, That's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time!
Speaker 2: I see. If you lived in an old house, Would it be decorated in a modern way?
Speaker 1: No, I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state. I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a.
Speaker 1: Well, What are you going to do now? Have you made any plans?
Speaker 2: Yes, I intend to go to university. That'll be in September. But it all depends on my A level results.
Speaker 1: You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes.
Speaker 1: Ooh, That's my favorite. Maybe I'll have a small slice.
Speaker 2: Great. Would you like coffee or tea with that?
Speaker 1: I'll have a cup of tea.
Speaker 2: Do you take cream or sugar with your tea?
Speaker 1: Actually, Could I have some milk with that?
Speaker 2: Definitely. Would you like skim or whole milk?
Speaker 1: Skim, Please. That'd be very nice. Thanks... Oh no. Janna, I'm so sorry, But I've got to go.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident. I need to go pick her up.
Speaker 2: I'll go with you. Where is she?
Speaker 1: She's on theM40, Near Reading.
Speaker 2: Is she alright?
Speaker 1: I don't know, She didn't say. I'm so sorry about this.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. Family comes first. Come on, Let's go.
Speaker 1: Actually, I've only got a two-seater. I'll have to go on my own.
Speaker 2: Ok. Just call me if you need anything then.
Speaker 1: I will. Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad! I am sorry to hear that!
Speaker 2: Forget it, There is no use crying over the spilled milk.
Speaker 1: What is the international community doing to help?
Speaker 2: The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies. Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies. Refugee camps have been set up across the region.
Speaker 1: How many countries have been affected?
Speaker 2: Six have been seriously affected, But the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries.
Speaker 1: I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran.
Speaker 2: Yes. There have been a few there recently. They say that this one was not a big quake. The Iranians are dealing with it on their own. They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble.
Speaker 1: Does the newspaper say anything about casualties?
Speaker 2: So far, Less than 20 people have died, But over 100 are in hospital.
Speaker 1: Yes, It's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds.
Speaker 2: How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas?
Speaker 1: The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms. The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation.
Speaker 2: It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody!
Speaker 1: You are quite right.
Speaker 1: Oh, Really? I saw it two years ago. It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I found it is so close to our life.
Speaker 1: It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world.
Speaker 2: You said it. You know, The divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years.
Speaker 1: Well, It's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too.
Speaker 2: I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too short-lived.
Speaker 2: That's true. It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation.
Speaker 1: I can't agree more. The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage.
Speaker 2: Definitely. They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously.
Speaker 1: In their mind, Love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone.
Speaker 2: I think, As the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste, It is the same thing with marriage.
Speaker 1: Are you serious, John?
Speaker 2: All I'm trying to say is that life is... Like... Er... This painting.
Speaker 1: Yes, That happens.
Speaker 2: I brought my transcript from my first year. Here. And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall.
Speaker 1: Alright. Good. I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements. You have one botany class and one chemistry class. And political science. So that's nine credits. Did you take English Composition 201?
Speaker 2: No, I don't need to. I took Advanced Placement English in high school. So I'm not required to take composition.
Speaker 1: Excellent. I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester. And the modern novel class. You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet.
Speaker 2: No, I thought I would take it later.
Speaker 1: Actually, I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later.
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class. I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets.
Speaker 1: Let me look at the timetable. Shakespeare meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11.
Speaker 2: I can take it then. I have that time slot free.
Speaker 1: Good. I recommend it. Shakespeare is of course enormously important. We want our students to take the class as soon as they can. And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher.
Speaker 2: I'll take it then.
Speaker 1: Tell me, Lisa, What made you decide to be an English major?
Speaker 2: I want to be an English professor in the future. I love studying literature, And I want to teach it.
Speaker 1: Really? That's great to know.
Speaker 2: That's the reason I want to finish my B. A. In four years. Because I know I will be in school a long time. I want to start theM. A. And Ph.D. Program as soon as possible.
Speaker 1: What else did you see?
Speaker 2: Art galleries, Cathedrals, Statues, Fountains, Palaces, Bistros, There's really too much to say.
Speaker 1: You must have had a great time.
Speaker 2: Yes, At the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun. However, On the third day of traveling in the city, I felt sick. I think I had something bad to eat, But it passed by the evening.
Speaker 1: Yes, You need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad. Sometimes new food might disagree with you.
Speaker 2: On the fouth day, We went to taste the French cuisine. That was really fantastic! And no stomach problems.
Speaker 1: That is great. Everyone says French food is wonderful.
Speaker 2: You'll have to try for yourself some day.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Miss, I'm very sorry for the delay, Please enjoy this. Free a glass of wine for inconvenience. Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: Me? Oh, No. In fact, I took up dancing quite recently.
Speaker 2: Oh, Really? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you say so, You dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments. It's just that you are a good leader. Do you like the fox-trot and tango?
Speaker 1: Yes. And what dances do you do best?
Speaker 2: Disco is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings, And is a healthy exercise. But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance.
Speaker 1: Oh, Well, The music has stopped. Thank you for the dance.
Speaker 2: My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.
Speaker 1: Fine.
Speaker 1: What did you do last week?
Speaker 2: We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff. It's very exciting.
Speaker 1: Wow. That sounds like a lot of fun. I am sorry I missed it.
Speaker 2: Well, You should come this weekend. I think you could do the climb.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will. See you then!
Speaker 2: Ok, See you.
Speaker 1: Wow. That is a very big family. Do you all live together?
Speaker 2: Of course we do! My father's parents, Mum, Dad, Three unmarried aunts, Two uncles, My two brothers, My three sisters and me.
Speaker 1: But you don't live at home anymore.
Speaker 2: Right, But that's where my heart is. But you're right, Now there are only 14 living at home.
Speaker 1: My goodness! Your family must live in a huge house.
Speaker 2: Yes. My family lives in rural Korea, Near Pusan. We have a huge house. The first floor of the house is a part-time private school. In the afternoon, Students come for special tutoring in biology, Englis.
Speaker 1: Wow! You grew up in a school! No wonder your English is excellent!
Speaker 2: My aunts and uncles are all teachers.
Speaker 1: You are so lucky!
Speaker 2: I guess so. While growing up, I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year.
Speaker 1: That's what i did in America. I was reading all the time. I was never a big TV watcher. Tv wastes time.
Speaker 2: I agree. Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English. All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English.
Speaker 1: 800 books? I'm impressed!
Speaker 2: My aunts studied in the American universities. They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English. That's what they learn here in America.
Speaker 1: For crying out loud... How fast are we losing money?
Speaker 2: Um... How can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, We will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months.
Speaker 1: What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news?
Speaker 2: Oh, That's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, Well, Half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're going to have to shoulder this cost.
Speaker 1: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess!
Speaker 2: We tried that, Sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.
Speaker 1: We're doomed!
Speaker 2: There is some really good news though!
Speaker 1: Really? What!
Speaker 2: I got offered a new job!
Speaker 1: What's strength do you bring to the job?
Speaker 2: I get along well with people, And I enjoy working with others.
Speaker 1: That's good. We always need team players here.
Speaker 1: Tomorrow morning. Try it.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: Are you going to this class this morning?
Speaker 2: Of course, Easy. No sweat.
Speaker 1: You're no able to move after this class.
Speaker 2: Are you kidding me? It's going to be up a piece of cake.
Speaker 1: You want to bet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, What't the bet?
Speaker 1: I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Where's Mexico?
Speaker 2: Mexico is south of the United States.
Speaker 1: How about Connecticut? Where's that?
Speaker 2: Connecticut is east of New York.
Speaker 1: What state is west of Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Ohio.
Speaker 1: Ok, Where's Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles is in California. It's southeast of San Francisco.
Speaker 1: Where's Boston.
Speaker 2: Boston is in the northeast part of the country.
Speaker 1: Where is Las Vegas?
Speaker 2: Las Vegas is in the southwest.
Speaker 1: I prefer the novels by Hemingway, Such as The Old Man and the Sea. I like the simple words in his novels.
Speaker 2: Yup. Though the words he used are simple, But the spirit he has conveyed is great.
Speaker 1: Absolutely!
Speaker 1: She's glowing. It must be the pregnancy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Or the expensive Italian facial treatments.
Speaker 1: How nice! I can see you are busying packing. I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Speaker 2: That's all right. I'm almost finished. Do you need my help?
Speaker 1: Yes, Could you please go over this for me? And see if there is any mistake in it?
Speaker 2: Oh. All right I'll read it soon.
Speaker 1: Excuse me for taking your time.
Speaker 2: It's nothing Nancy.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk?
Speaker 2: Yes, But there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk.
Speaker 1: How about the shelf?
Speaker 2: I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it?
Speaker 1: Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go.
Speaker 2: I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing?
Speaker 1: Cheer up! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week. There is no need to write a new one. Oh, What's this? Is this your dissertation?
Speaker 2: Let me see. Yes, That's it. Where did you find it?
Speaker 1: You'Ve put it among these journals.
Speaker 2: My poor memory. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Well, To be fare, Since he's coming all the way from Lancaster, He's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us. He must get start on his commute about six thirty, No telling what time he actually gets up.
Speaker 2: That's right, Because he's got to get to the train station from his house, Then take the blue line into the city, Then switch trains to the red line. In all, The trip's got to take more than 2 hours.
Speaker 1: Why doesn't he just drive to work?
Speaker 2: It's too difficult to park your car in the city. Also, The traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Peter! Pack them. Don't read them.
Speaker 1: These magazines are interesting. May I borrow one?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Thanks, John.
Speaker 1: How about giving them to that old man?
Speaker 2: Good idea.
Speaker 1: By the way, Do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, But still it did attract a large crowds today.
Speaker 1: I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper.
Speaker 2: But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: Anyway, Let's just finish out job and get back home.
Speaker 1: Okay. Howtiring the job is!
Speaker 1: You think it's funny. I'm terrified.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. It's safe.
Speaker 1: But I've never jumped off anything in my life. The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed. I'm scared.
Speaker 2: You are the one who wanted to come here, Sandy. You should enjoy it.
Speaker 1: I guess I'm adventuresome, But then I'm scared too.
Speaker 2: I'm not too scared. But I've done sky diving before.
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 1: Enjoy yourself.
Speaker 1: But my father did not. He didn't have much time.
Speaker 2: Honey, I'm sorry. I promise you, This summer vacation, I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains. It is more beautiful and magnificent.
Speaker 1: Really? It's a deal. Have you ever been there?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went there five years ago. You were still a baby at that time.
Speaker 1: It really gets me interested. Is it higher than Kiang Shan?
Speaker 2: Surely. You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls. The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty.
Speaker 1: Can I see the rainbow?
Speaker 2: That depends. If you are lucky, You can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks.
Speaker 1: Yes, We'll start with appetizers, Follow with a soup and salad course, Then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken, And finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort.
Speaker 2: That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal, Don't you think?
Speaker 1: As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic, We should be okay.
Speaker 2: With your prime rib and chicken choices, You'd better hope nobody's vegetarian.
Speaker 1: We can make some special arrangement if we need to. After all, It's the company who is footing the bill.
Speaker 1: Got that.
Speaker 2: Ok - when you leave the Underground, Cross the road and you should see Horntown Street. Was up that street to the crossroads. As you was you should see a fast food place on your right.
Speaker 1: Hold on, I am looking at the map now. Ok, I can see Horntown Road. Do I go straight at the intersection?
Speaker 2: No, You need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right.
Speaker 1: Ok, I can see that road.
Speaker 2: That's fine. You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library.
Speaker 1: Good, I can see the library on the map.
Speaker 2: Ok, We live in the third building on your left. Will we see you around 7 pm?
Speaker 1: That's great, See you at seven.
Speaker 1: Freshman orientation is the last week of august, But I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in.
Speaker 2: You're so lucky! Do you have to do many things before you leave?
Speaker 1: Yes. I'll be very busy! I have to get a visa, Buy a plane ticket, And pack my things. But first, I want to register for classes.
Speaker 2: When can you do that?
Speaker 1: Well, They sent me their prospectus, So I can start looking now. Do you want to help me decide which classed to take?
Speaker 2: Sure. What can you choose from?
Speaker 1: Well, I have to take all the fundamental course, Plus a few from my major.
Speaker 2: What is your major?
Speaker 1: I hope to major in English literature, But the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year, So we'll see.
Speaker 2: What are the fundamental course?
Speaker 1: In order to graduate, Every student must take a certain amount of classes in history, Math, English, Philosophy, Science and art.
Speaker 2: Interesting. That's very different from the Chinese education system.
Speaker 1: Yes, It is. It's also very different from the British education system.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Oh, Sure. In British, Students don't have to take the foundation course.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Maybe because they think they know everything already! Ha ha.
Speaker 1: Yeah, You're a pretty big guy. I play goalie, Myself.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah? Which team?
Speaker 1: The Rockets.
Speaker 2: Really? I think we play you guys next week. Well, I have to go to practice. See you later.
Speaker 1: All right, See you later.
Speaker 1: And how long does the course last?
Speaker 2: It lasts for 9 months.
Speaker 1: When does it start?
Speaker 2: The next beginning class starts on October 25th.
Speaker 1: What time is the class?
Speaker 2: From 7 to 9 o'clock.
Speaker 1: How much does it cost?
Speaker 2: It costs 125 dollars a month.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's all right. I want to enroll in the course.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Please fill out this form for us.
Speaker 1: Do you want me to fill it out now?
Speaker 2: Yes, Please. We need a record of you education and your work experiences.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. Are you here alone?
Speaker 2: My father and sister are out to photographing. What about you?
Speaker 1: I'm a back-packer from America.
Speaker 2: What is a back-packer?
Speaker 1: It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world.
Speaker 2: Cool. You must have been to a lot of places.
Speaker 1: Yes, Actually almost half of all the countries over the world. I love traveling places.
Speaker 2: So cool. I want to be a back-packer when I grow up.
Speaker 1: You can do it. But do work hard on your English to make it easier.
Speaker 2: I'll try my best.
Speaker 1: Uh, Are you sure about that? I thought espresso was an Italian word.
Speaker 1: Yes, I did. Have you lived here long?
Speaker 2: Me? I guess so. I've lived here for about six years now. Have you lived in America very long?
Speaker 1: No, Not really. When I left Vietnam, I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years. Where do you work, Alice?
Speaker 2: I teach mathematics at a college. What do you do?
Speaker 1: I am an accountant at a company.
Speaker 2: Well, Tom. It's good to meet you. I have to go now. I am teaching a class this evening, And I need to get to the college.
Speaker 1: It's nice meeting you too, Alice.
Speaker 2: See you around!
Speaker 1: Goodbye, Alice.
Speaker 1: Bye!
Speaker 1: I see. I generally like movies to help calm me down. I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Unfortunately, Nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film.
Speaker 1: True. The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial. You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value. I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today. You can name a lot of classics from that decade.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties. They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time.
Speaker 1: I'm totally with you on that.
Speaker 1: Hang in there. It'll all come together one of these days.
Speaker 1: What do you plan on doing after you retire?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think I will do something new. I'Ve always wanted to be a teacher. I'm willing to begin studying to teach.
Speaker 1: I admire your energy, Ruth. You are young at heart.
Speaker 1: Does she wear glasses?
Speaker 2: No... No. I think you're thinking of someone else.
Speaker 1: No. I'm sure I know her.
Speaker 2: Er... What else can I tell you? Er... She's got... Er a... Round face, A very round face, And a very big mouth, Sort of wide mouth, When she laughs, Her face is all mouth.
Speaker 1: Ah... No, I can't place her.
Speaker 1: What are their names?
Speaker 2: Jack and Stephanie.
Speaker 1: How old are they?
Speaker 2: Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24.
Speaker 1: Are they in school?
Speaker 2: Stephanie is. She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida.
Speaker 1: What does Stephanie study?
Speaker 2: She studies English.
Speaker 1: Is she here now?
Speaker 2: No, She's at school.
Speaker 1: That would be great!
Speaker 2: Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading?
Speaker 1: This one right here should be right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that, Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Let's do the math.
Speaker 2: I count all of the correct answers, Total them, And divide by the total. Does this look right to you?
Speaker 1: Looks pretty good.
Speaker 2: Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying!
Speaker 1: Congratulations!
Speaker 2: And so I bought all these books on having kids and...
Speaker 1: And they said you should play classical music?
Speaker 2: How did you know! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter!
Speaker 1: Not anymore! Can you believe it? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore!
Speaker 2: Nice try. I wasn't born yesterday, You know.
Speaker 1: I'm dead serious. They've decided that it's too small to be a planet, But actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore.
Speaker 2: That sounds crazy. But they can't just change their mind about things like that.
Speaker 1: Yes, They can. If you remember correctly, People used to believe that the world was flat.
Speaker 2: I suppose you're right. They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them, Not the other way around.
Speaker 1: We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos.
Speaker 2: Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation?
Speaker 1: I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way.
Speaker 2: Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space?
Speaker 1: I hope not. I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth.
Speaker 2: You're so old-fashioned. That's what people used to think about people from another country!
Speaker 1: Point taken. Hopefully one day, We'll live in an interplanetary society.
Speaker 1: Well, What are you going to do now? Have you made any plans?
Speaker 2: Yes, I intend to go to university. That'll be in September. But it all depends on my A level results.
Speaker 1: Tomorrow? No, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to. I'm going out of the town on business.
Speaker 2: What about Saturday?
Speaker 1: Sorry, I never go out on Saturday evening. I always watch football on Saturday evening.
Speaker 2: Will you come round next Tuesday?
Speaker 1: Next Tuesday? Just a moment! It will be the 21st of May. Oh, Dear. Arm... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party.
Speaker 2: What do you say to next Wednesday then?
Speaker 1: Look at the snow, It's so beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yes. It's really snowing.
Speaker 1: I love winter, I love snow.
Speaker 2: But don't you think it's a little too cold?
Speaker 1: But I like cold more than hot.
Speaker 2: You are so interesting.
Speaker 1: Do you ever speak to native speakers of English?
Speaker 2: Sadly, I hardly ever speak to English people. I usually practice with my Chinese friends.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: She would be laughing one moment, And if I said something insensitive, She would start crying. I didn't want to deal with that.
Speaker 1: She sounds very emotional.
Speaker 2: She was a psycho, Man. One time we were suppose to get together. I was waiting for her call, And when she finally called, She was screaming why I wasn't at her place.
Speaker 1: Were you suppose to be there?
Speaker 2: I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping. It was a misunderstanding. She was literally screaming on the phone over this.
Speaker 1: Yes. But those are the rush in that moment. And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters.
Speaker 2: Didn't you tell him you have an appointment?
Speaker 1: Well, No. I thought I ‘Ve finish in five minutes. And I didn't want to be difficult about just few minutes, If I hadn't been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Well. You're here.
Speaker 1: She liked the acting, Too, Because that's what she wanted to see.
Speaker 2: I wasn't happy with it.
Speaker 1: Nothing is to your satisfaction.
Speaker 1: Perhaps. I'm dead tired.
Speaker 1: What makes you say that?
Speaker 2: Today, I'm told I failed three courses.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Work harder next term.
Speaker 2: B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me.
Speaker 1: Don't lose heart. Everything will be fine.
Speaker 2: I hope so.
Speaker 1: A virtual office?
Speaker 2: Yeah, An office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies. I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building.
Speaker 1: What kind of services do they offer?
Speaker 2: A separated office, Internet access, Phone services, Fax services, Mail & courier services, And almost everything you have in a conventional office.
Speaker 1: Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.
Speaker 2: Well, It looks very nice.
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 1: I'm going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag.
Speaker 2: Afterwards, We can do the washing up together. Everything will be finished within an hour. Your friend Keith is really funny. I liked his magic tricks.
Speaker 1: Yes, He's very good .. isn't he? He told some funny stories too.
Speaker 1: So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out.
Speaker 2: Don't pull my leg.
Speaker 1: This way you'll probably put on more weight. Will you give up?
Speaker 2: Surely not. I can feel the results. I'm starting to feel different now.
Speaker 1: Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight?
Speaker 2: I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed.
Speaker 1: That's the man I told you about. Remember?
Speaker 2: Ah yes. The one who offered you a job in Australia.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Who's this?
Speaker 1: Guess!
Speaker 2: It's not you, Is it?
Speaker 1: That's right. I grew a beard during the trip, But I shaved it off when I came home.
Speaker 2: Why did you shave it off?
Speaker 1: Who has a crush?
Speaker 2: Come on, Ted! Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You'Ve got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out.
Speaker 2: What are you so afraid of? Just tell her what you are feeling about her.
Speaker 1: I'd totally die if she turned me down.
Speaker 2: But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You'Ve got to let her know. Come on! You'Ve got to take a chance. Even though you are rejected, It's not the end of the world. There's nothing to lose, Is there?
Speaker 1: Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines, All of them have the side effect. She has lost all her hair.
Speaker 1: No. We'll meet at my house. He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa.
Speaker 2: That's nice. Where is his villa?
Speaker 1: It's not his villa, But his father's. I think it's somewhere in Florida. I am not sure myself.
Speaker 2: Sometimes I envy you a lot. Tom is a good guy.
Speaker 1: Come on. You just haven't met the right person and I think that you work too much. You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life.
Speaker 1: So there are only five working days in a week?
Speaker 2: Right. What are you going to do tonight?
Speaker 1: I'm going to study.
Speaker 2: On a Friday night?
Speaker 1: Well, I need to polish up my English.
Speaker 1: She's fairly tall, Maybe 2 inches taller than me.
Speaker 2: Is she chubby?
Speaker 1: Not at all. She's actually very athletic.
Speaker 2: It sounds like she's pretty good-looking. Does she wear glasses?
Speaker 1: No, But she does wear contact lenses.
Speaker 2: How's her skin?
Speaker 1: She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose.
Speaker 1: I know a place that should be perfect. It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety. You can even buy a live chicken there if you want.
Speaker 2: Live chicken? Thanks, But no thanks. So... Tell me about bargaining. How can I do it like a local?
Speaker 1: Well. I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person. You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that. But... If you're smart, You can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price.
Speaker 1: Me too. You look so beautiful tonight! I wish this night would never end. There's something I have to tell you...
Speaker 2: What is it?
Speaker 1: I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day, But I was wrong. A twist of fate brought us together. I crashed into your life and you into mine, And this may sound crazy, But I'm falling in love with you, Veronica.
Speaker 1: Sure. What is it?
Speaker 2: Hmm... Okay, Here's the thing. I'Ve always seen you as more than just a friend, And I can't take it any more. I know you better than anyone, I know the pros and cons of your personality, I even know what side of the bed is yours! I think we would be great together, Don't you?
Speaker 1: Are you serious? We'Ve been friends for years! We can't just change that overnight!
Speaker 2: I know! I never had the guts to tell you... Until today. So, What do you say? Are you willing to give me a shot?
Speaker 1: That sounds nice. How do you spend your mornings?
Speaker 2: I usually do housework in mornings. I go shopping occasionally. I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket. I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center. It takes about 20 minutes to drive there.
Speaker 1: How do you spend your afternoons?
Speaker 2: I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies. I spend winter evening watching tv, But I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time.
Speaker 1: But... But...
Speaker 2: But what? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue, But also a great revenue.
Speaker 1: Ah, The transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget.
Speaker 2: Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel. But if we want to save money, We can choose a hotel which is not so good.
Speaker 1: Hmm, What I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel.
Speaker 2: In that case, We can choose the Youth Hotel. It's a good choice, Clean and economic.
Speaker 1: I mean Internet brings benefit a lot, But also some disadvantages. For example, Many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online, Etc.
Speaker 2: I agree. But I think although it has some negative effects, On the whole Internet does more good to us than harm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, You are right. But we have to know how to make good use of it.
Speaker 1: Congratulations to you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, That's right. So what are you studying?
Speaker 2: Business management.
Speaker 1: That sounds interesting.
Speaker 1: You can't think of anything?
Speaker 2: I really like where I'm at now.
Speaker 1: So, Why don't you just stay here?
Speaker 2: That may be what I'm going to do.
Speaker 1: It's a perfectly good school.
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Do you know what you're going to do now?
Speaker 2: I'm just going to stay at PCC.
Speaker 1: Why? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live.
Speaker 2: Yeah, But so what! I'm proud to live in the world's most exciting city. And, The salaries here are the highest in the nation, Too.
Speaker 2: Why don't you go talk to her?
Speaker 1: You think she's out of my league?
Speaker 2: Hell no! You're just a chicken that's all.
Speaker 1: C'mon. I get nervous when I talk to girls.
Speaker 2: Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up, Strike a conversation.
Speaker 1: What do I talk about?
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter. You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that.
Speaker 1: I don't know...
Speaker 1: How about a snack after work?
Speaker 2: I couldn't careless.
Speaker 1: Would you rather stay home?
Speaker 2: Whatever you say.
Speaker 1: Are you really interested in doing something?
Speaker 2: I don't mind if you want to.
Speaker 1: It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active.
Speaker 1: Do you mean financially rewarding?
Speaker 2: Well, Many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries.
Speaker 1: I'Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy.
Speaker 2: Sometimes that's true, But not usually. Most feds are honest, Hard-working professionals. It's hard to keep highly trained people, So the pay and working conditions have to be attractive.
Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?
Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I am impressed with how smart and humorous.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's love at first sight.
Speaker 1: And that's it. You're done.
Speaker 2: I see what you mean. That was pretty easy after all.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. We really had a good time.
Speaker 2: Well. Thank you for coming.
Speaker 1: So see you.
Speaker 2: Bye.
Speaker 1: Really? That's the icing on the cake. Congratulation again!
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale. It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on.
Speaker 2: That sounds great. Where should we meet?
Speaker 1: I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes.
Speaker 2: Sounds good. See you there.
Speaker 1: What do you think about these shoes?
Speaker 2: They're cute. But do you think you'll wear them much?
Speaker 1: Well, I hate the noise in the city, But I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The tow just don't go together.
Speaker 2: I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, But I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities.
Speaker 1: People can't have it both ways. If you live in the country, It is often less convenient. If you live in a city, It is noisy, Buy there's more to do.
Speaker 1: Well, My boyfriend was supposed to call me last night, But he never did.
Speaker 2: That's too bad. I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it. Don't be too upset about it.
Speaker 1: The thing is, This isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't.
Speaker 2: I see how that can get a bit annoying.
Speaker 1: A bit? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would! He's such a liar.
Speaker 2: So what are you going to do about it?
Speaker 1: I'm speaking French. Don't you know anything?
Speaker 2: What's wrong with speaking English?
Speaker 1: Well, I just got back from my language school. We have to speak French all day there. No English allowed!
Speaker 2: What are you doing that for?
Speaker 1: I'm trying to learn new skills. It makes me more qualified for a good job.
Speaker 2: Good for you.
Speaker 1: You have all the fun, Don't you?
Speaker 2: Listen, I'd better get back to the grindstone.
Speaker 1: Sure thing, Johnny. Watch out for dishpan hands there, Kid!
Speaker 1: I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty.
Speaker 2: Yes. I think I won't come here again next time.
Speaker 1: So do I.
Speaker 2: We waste a vacation.
Speaker 1: Maybe you are right.
Speaker 1: Let me see. We can visit the country. We haven't done that for such a long time.
Speaker 2: Good idea. I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby. We'll go to the zoo and the park another time. After all, We can put that off.
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 1: There are a lot of wild animals in that place, And also some special rules while visiting.
Speaker 2: Special rules?
Speaker 1: There, You only have two ways for visiting.
Speaker 2: Details?
Speaker 1: On their bus or in your own cars, And you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus. You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be.
Speaker 1: Sounds interesting! That must be very convenient.
Speaker 2: Yes, You're right. I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move. It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me.
Speaker 1: How can you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, If I simply want to write a few words, I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser.
Speaker 1: That's really interesting. You have to play for me some time.
Speaker 2: Sure, So, What about you? Do you have any hobbies?
Speaker 1: Well, I collect beer mats. I'm not sure that counts, Though.
Speaker 1: My friends and I just got back from Bali.
Speaker 2: Wow! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world, Don't they?
Speaker 1: Yes, We were lucky. My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands, So we were able to stay for free.
Speaker 2: Did you go diving while you were there?
Speaker 1: I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die.
Speaker 2: I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension.
Speaker 1: That's one of the conditions of my policy too. It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire.
Speaker 2: Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy?
Speaker 1: That's what my parents want me to do.
Speaker 2: You should take their advice. They know what's best for you.
Speaker 1: But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun, While I spend all my time doing reading and writing.
Speaker 2: But if you go to university, You'll still have time for fun.
Speaker 1: Hm, What you say makes sense. But you know, I still have to ask my parents for pocket money, And I hate to do so at this age.
Speaker 2: And if you try to find a part-time job, You'll have some money too.
Speaker 1: Jen, It's not alive... But it does look user-friendly.
Speaker 2: I would look so cool carrying this around!
Speaker 1: I like landscapes and still life. You prefer abstract paintings, Don't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. I like painters who use rather than watercolors. The colors appear richer. What do you think?
Speaker 1: They are beautiful. You did a good job.
Speaker 2: Thank you for saying so.
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, You are really a terrific photographer.
Speaker 1: That won't be necessary, Elvin. Look, I want to apologize for your nose. I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Why are you being so nice to me? Don't think for a second that I trust you.
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 1: When did you begin to smoke?
Speaker 2: I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?
Speaker 2: Yes, Twice.
Speaker 1: Right on, Right on! Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite! He was low on bread, But Sherry paid for everything.
Speaker 2: Gravy! Jim is such a jive turkey man. He is always hitting me up for cash. Anyway, You wanna book and go grab some grub?
Speaker 1: Yeah man, I'm starving!
Speaker 1: But let me tell you, You're doing just fine. I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German. By the way, How long have you been learning English?
Speaker 2: On and off, For quite a few years.
Speaker 1: That's incredible!
Speaker 1: Well, I really like being with her.
Speaker 2: Have you thought about going Dutch?
Speaker 1: Dutch, Where's that?
Speaker 2: Not where, What. Dutch means you both pay your own way.
Speaker 1: Oh. I wonder if she'll go for that.
Speaker 1: Um... Let me see now, Is it 18 or 19, I can never remember... 18... 19 next birthday.Tthat's it.
Speaker 2: What does she look like?
Speaker 1: Well...
Speaker 2: Pretty, Is she?
Speaker 1: Yes... Quite pretty.
Speaker 1: Never.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah. People down our way hardly speak to each other.
Speaker 1: How come?
Speaker 2: It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected.
Speaker 1: Oh. It's awful, But it can't be helped.
Speaker 2: I'll just have to put up with it.
Speaker 1: I cant't believe it. You've worked here for years.
Speaker 1: I never thought about it that way.
Speaker 2: I bet you eat a large evening meal, Then sit and watch TV or read a book. Then instead of burning off your energy, Your body stores it as fat.
Speaker 1: Oh doctor, I feel so foolish.
Speaker 2: Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits.
Speaker 1: We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, But cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced.
Speaker 2: The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.
Speaker 1: I think you're right. An international response to this problem is needed.
Speaker 1: All right. I only hope to get a skillful driver, And drive me to my stop safe way.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot, Bye bye.
Speaker 2: You are welcome, Bye.
Speaker 1: Who composed it for your?
Speaker 2: You needn't ask anyone. You can get on line to search for one.
Speaker 1: Can I get on line to search one, Too?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON.
Speaker 1: What about my SIEMENS?
Speaker 2: Numerous. It's time that everybody is particular about personality. Find one and change yours.
Speaker 1: I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in, But they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again!
Speaker 2: What did they say?
Speaker 1: They both just talk about how great they are all the time.
Speaker 2: Theysoud like the neighbours from hell!
Speaker 1: Well, We have always dreamed of owning our own home, But real estate in this area is extremely expensive.
Speaker 2: I understand. That's why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town, Far from the city.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea if you can find employment nearby.
Speaker 2: I agree. That's why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine, Or Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: What about me? I'm your friend.
Speaker 2: I know you are, You are my girlfriend. I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes.
Speaker 1: I know what you mean. I find it difficult to make new friends, Too. It's not as easy as it was when we were young, Is it?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Really! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival?
Speaker 2: Oh... Sure. We have an entire month! In traditional Chinese culture, Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit.
Speaker 1: Cool! A whole month! What do you do during that month?
Speaker 2: Well, People sometimes set off firecrackers, Some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense. Mainly though, You need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry.
Speaker 1: Nice pun. What is it you active about him most?
Speaker 2: He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom.
Speaker 1: He looks like a very personable man.
Speaker 2: He was. He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met.
Speaker 1: Geez! Now that I think about it, Maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, And I didn't become addicted or anything like that.
Speaker 2: You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize!
Speaker 1: Yes, I would.
Speaker 2: Mr. : Here's a hall pass for it. Do you need someone to walk you there?
Speaker 1: I can manage on my own. Thanks.
Speaker 2: Mr. : I'll drop by later to check on you.
Speaker 1: Thank you, They're beautiful. You can hang your coat over there. Try this new couch, It is so comfortable. You will love it. Want something to drink, Tea, Coffee, Juice or Cola?
Speaker 2: Don't bother. I will help myself.
Speaker 1: Make yourself at home.
Speaker 1: It must be a unique experience. I'm looking forward to share your story when you come back.
Speaker 2: Ok, I will bring you photos as many as possible.
Speaker 1: Did you tell your parents yet?
Speaker 2: Not yet. I didn't get a hold of them. I'll try to call them again tonight.
Speaker 1: They're probably going to be so happy.
Speaker 2: I think so. It's turning out to be a great day.
Speaker 1: No, I haven't seen those spots.
Speaker 2: The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit. Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night?
Speaker 1: I park in the daytime.
Speaker 2: Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits. Have you noticed those signs?
Speaker 1: No, I have not seen the signs.
Speaker 2: Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there. Do you know what the curb colors mean?
Speaker 1: That's true. Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones.
Speaker 2: Actually, It's not the fault of the mobile phone. But people should have a proper attitude towards it. Mobile phone is a tool serving people, Not the fetters restricting them.
Speaker 1: Port, Please.
Speaker 2: Excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor.
Speaker 1: The port is quite exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right?
Speaker 2: Yes. You always have a good nose for wines.
Speaker 1: Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.
Speaker 2: Oh, What's that?
Speaker 1: Here you are, Sir. Bourbon withiced water.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Now how much do I owe you?
Speaker 1: The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge. So the total is 16. 5 dollars.
Speaker 2: That is OK. Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about that, I am sure they will understand. After all, It was a very difficult exam.
Speaker 2: What am I to do?
Speaker 1: You can always take it again.
Speaker 1: No. It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was.
Speaker 2: Well, Then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner?
Speaker 1: I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men.
Speaker 2: Or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men.
Speaker 1: Yeah, How about your maths teacher?
Speaker 2: He's an old antique, Very serious.
Speaker 1: Bad luck, Anne.
Speaker 2: Hey! How about your history teacher?
Speaker 1: She's another antique.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Don't be afraid. She isn't going to bite you.
Speaker 1: Who is afraid? I am not afraid.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Look, It's starting!
Speaker 2: Mysteries of the Pyramids. Didn't we watch this program last week?
Speaker 1: It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture. What do you think about this?
Speaker 2: Well, Its theme is moving and profound, So from the academic aspect, This is its advantage to win the award.
Speaker 1: I went a long time ago, Before they built the new train that can take you there.
Speaker 2: Would you recommend going there for a few days?
Speaker 1: Personally, I think it'd be better to go when you have more time. A few days isn't really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital.
Speaker 2: You're probably right. What do you think about Yangshao?
Speaker 1: It's a beautiful city, But I think it's become too touristy. How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong?
Speaker 1: Nothing exactly. She's grown into a very attractive young lady.
Speaker 2: Oh, She is.
Speaker 1: You know, Her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others.
Speaker 2: Not surprising. I bet she's very tall and slim.
Speaker 1: Yean. Around five feet five inches tall.
Speaker 1: Why don't you like horror? They're entertaining.
Speaker 2: Some are entertaining, But I find most of them stupid and childish. For example, I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious.
Speaker 1: Ha ha. I know what you mean. But it's just a movie. They need for the characters to do that.
Speaker 1: You know, Speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use.
Speaker 1: Hang in there. It'll all come together one of these days.
Speaker 1: Yes, Thank you.
Speaker 1: That sounds ridiculous. Why?
Speaker 2: Well, I am gaining weight these days, And I have to watch my calories.
Speaker 1: Come on. We are already here. Besides, I really wanna see this picture.
Speaker 2: All right. Let's see when the next movie is playing?
Speaker 1: Seven thirty. There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line!
Speaker 2: Shall we take a chance?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Let's do so.
Speaker 1: You mean you didn't know much English then?
Speaker 2: Right. I only knew a few English sentences.
Speaker 1: That's incredible. Could you tell me what you did to make a start?
Speaker 2: First, I worked as a servant.
Speaker 1: Really? I wish you could tell me more about your experience.
Speaker 1: My husband is betting on France.
Speaker 2: France? Is he crazy?
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, How can I put this? France is a terrible team.
Speaker 1: I can see that. Then what is your favorite coffee?
Speaker 2: Irish coffee is my favorite. But I can drink any other. I'm not particular on it.
Speaker 1: All right. Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home?
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The survey said that the low, Income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis.
Speaker 1: That makes sense. Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper.
Speaker 2: And junk food contains lots of fat and oil. There is one final reason why so many people are fat.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 1: Ok. People decorate their houses, Place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together.
Speaker 1: Yeah, You're right. Good night.
Speaker 1: No, He doesn't. Anyway, She found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time.
Speaker 2: Maybe it is for the best. They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 1: The Dai people are enthusiastic.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Yeah, It was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, But here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.
Speaker 1: Sure, You still have my contact details, Right?
Speaker 2: You know what, This is really embarrassing, But your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me?
Speaker 1: Sure, My name is Ana Ferris. Don't worry about it. It happens to me all the time. I'm terrible with names too.
Speaker 1: Alright, The puck is back in play now. Pavel Bure is on a breakaway! He is flying down the ice! The defenders can't keep up! Slap shot! He scores.
Speaker 1: Two months? How did you find out?
Speaker 2: I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, And I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately.
Speaker 1: So you asked him about the girl who called?
Speaker 2: Yeah, He first said it was someone from work. He gave me a lame excuse, And so I pressed him on it.
Speaker 1: A very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher gives him the sign, He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive!
Speaker 2: The players are scrambling to get the ball. Vargas gets to first base and he's still going! The outfielder throws it to second! Vargas slides! He's safe!
Speaker 1: Well that's what being friends is about, Isn't it?
Speaker 2: Hey, What if the three of us go to the beach together? Besides, You and Bob haven't seen each other for a while. I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers.
Speaker 1: Nah, I wouldn't worry about that. But I don't want to be the third wheel. You two should have some quiet time to yourselves.
Speaker 2: I know Bob won't mind. You can bring a date, Like that guy from the bar you keep talking about.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence.
Speaker 2: That's all right. Would you have a cup of coffee?
Speaker 1: Yes, Please. It's very kind of you.
Speaker 2: Don't mention it.
Speaker 1: The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well. You are very helpful. I want to thank you for everything you've done for me.
Speaker 2: It's my pleasure.
Speaker 1: I bought you some books on literature, I don't know if you would like them.
Speaker 1: No, He doesn't. Anyway, She found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time.
Speaker 2: Maybe it is for the best. They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 1: That's really interesting, You have to play for me some time.
Speaker 2: Sure, So, What about you? Do you have any hobbies?
Speaker 1: Well, I collect beer mats. I'm not sure that counts, Though.
Speaker 1: And have you taken anything for it?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't.
Speaker 1: Well, It's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock. Then drink a cup every half hour. It really works!
Speaker 2: Ugh!
Speaker 1: Tell me about it.
Speaker 2: You guys are working around the clock, I know. That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves.
Speaker 1: Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month.
Speaker 1: Never? Really? I'm surprised.
Speaker 2: Many Americans have never gone to a ETV. It's not an American thing to do.
Speaker 1: But there are a lot of Kts in this town. There's one just two blocks from here.
Speaker 2: Ok, Let's go.
Speaker 1: She married Jerrod.
Speaker 2: You're kidding.
Speaker 1: She's going to live in Paris.
Speaker 2: Really? I'm surprised.
Speaker 1: Which is better?
Speaker 2: One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers.
Speaker 1: I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools.
Speaker 2: Yes, Sometimes.
Speaker 1: I guess you're right.
Speaker 2: Of course I'm right. I already told you the rule for Las Vegas. Remember?
Speaker 1: Yes, I remember. You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play.
Speaker 2: That's right. That's the best way to have control over yourself. You say to yourself. Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars. Only fifty dollars. No more. If you follow the rule, You can't lose more than fifty dollars.
Speaker 1: I know it's true, Sandy. But still some people lose control. They start to gamble, And they can't stop.
Speaker 1: But my Rose is great.
Speaker 2: Your Rose is a fool.
Speaker 1: Really, Mary, You're horrible.
Speaker 2: Why don't you marry Rose, Then?
Speaker 1: Mr. : I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves. Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage.
Speaker 2: May I have a book?
Speaker 1: Mr. : Here. Write your name inside the front cover. Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester, So keep it in good condition.
Speaker 1: With the greatest pleasure. Where is the concert this evening?
Speaker 2: It will be held at the Music Hall.
Speaker 1: What's on the program?
Speaker 2: It's a piano recital. I'm fond of piano, You know.
Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more. Actually, I'm a Beijing Opera fan.
Speaker 2: Really? Good for you.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what days the classes are on?
Speaker 2: One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p.M. To 4.
Speaker 1: And the other class?
Speaker 2: That class is from ten to twelve on Monday and Wednesday.
Speaker 1: Are you sure these are the only open classes?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, Sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday.
Speaker 2: Very well then.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Congratulations! Susan. I'm so happy for you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Really going to miss you.
Speaker 1: Me too. I'll write to you once I get settled. But I have so much to do. You might have to wait a while. But I really will write to you. I love to write letters. I think it's more meaning than the emails even than the phone call.
Speaker 2: Ok. Take care. Have a nice journey.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 1: But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money.
Speaker 2: Mmm, You may be right.
Speaker 1: Do you think we'll need our overcoats?
Speaker 2: No. We couldn't possibly.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: It will be summer. So it will be hot.
Speaker 1: Is that very likely in England?
Speaker 2: Yes. It could happen.
Speaker 1: You just pop'em in in the morning, Take them out at night, And then throw them away. No cleaning!
Speaker 2: Cool. So are you near-sighted or far-sighted?
Speaker 1: Near sighted.
Speaker 1: It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?
Speaker 2: There's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, But when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar h.
Speaker 1: Well, That's something I've never heard of. But if you as me what I value most in a friend, I would have to say honesty.
Speaker 1: What do you think of the literature course.
Speaker 2: It's very helpful. The course has let me into a world of literature. I read so many great literatures.
Speaker 1: Can't you hang out with them, Too?
Speaker 2: I could, But all they ever talk about is work, So I always end up feeling left out.
Speaker 1: Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, So it's just the two of you.
Speaker 2: I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her.
Speaker 1: Peach blossom is really beautiful.
Speaker 2: Yes. How about you?
Speaker 1: I like lotus.
Speaker 2: You have a perfect taste!
Speaker 1: But there aren't any lotus now.
Speaker 2: Yes. It's snowing outside. Let's enjoy the plum blossoms.
Speaker 1: That's not bad. Let's go.
Speaker 1: So, Is that a yes?
Speaker 2: Yes. What time does it start and do you want to meet me there?
Speaker 1: It starts at one and yea, Let's meet there. It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main.
Speaker 2: Great! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater!
Speaker 1: Thanks. I will.
Speaker 1: I disagree, A big town is more lively.
Speaker 2: But I like the small mountain village. The big town is noisy. How charming it is when walking along the hill!
Speaker 1: Well, Alright, I agree with you about that, But I still prefer a big town.
Speaker 1: What's the puzzle?
Speaker 2: My husband and I prefer to have no kids, But my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way.
Speaker 2: Yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night.
Speaker 1: Oh, Really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.
Speaker 2: But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not.
Speaker 1: What if he had his friends fake the reviews?
Speaker 2: You are so paranoid! Not everybody is a crook, You know.
Speaker 1: I don't think that you're done.
Speaker 2: What's wrong?
Speaker 1: My hair looks hideous.
Speaker 2: What's so bad about it?
Speaker 1: It doesn't look good at all.
Speaker 2: Sorry about that.
Speaker 1: I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this.
Speaker 2: Well, Let me talk to my manager, Okay?
Speaker 1: Oh, Gosh! I have to go to the restroom so bad! I can't bear it anymore!
Speaker 2: I'm sure a spot will open up soon.
Speaker 1: Oh, Look! There's a spot open next to the public restroom! Can I take it?
Speaker 1: I wanted to show you the cabin. We only had another half-hour to go.
Speaker 2: Well, Now we're stuck. What can we do?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: I've heard that when this happens, It's important to save energy.
Speaker 1: ( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr. Bellow and hands into him. ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail, Mr. Bellow.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Oh, It tastes excellent.
Speaker 1: But this chance is really precious.
Speaker 2: Well, I know. So I am thinking now.
Speaker 1: I hope you can make a clever choice. Anyway, The opportunities around you are not that By.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your kindness. I will think about it carefully.
Speaker 1: For me, I think I will iron my shirt and trousers. Actually, Weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week.
Speaker 2: I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights. But... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them.
Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more.
Speaker 1: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time!
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Honey, That was a great meal. I'm stuffed. Do we have any chips left?
Speaker 1: I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm.
Speaker 2: Ok, Can I bring a date with me?
Speaker 1: Certainly. But if there are going to be four of us, I had better make reservations.
Speaker 2: Yes. That is a very good idea. It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit.
Speaker 1: Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four.
Speaker 2: I'll be there. Oh, Is there a cover charge at the bar?
Speaker 1: Just plain water with plenty of ice rock.
Speaker 2: All right. Please wait for a minute.
Speaker 1: I think his house is fantastic, But I wouldn't want to live there. You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house, Plus a few people to take care of the gardens, And probably an au pair or two to take care of the children. It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own.
Speaker 2: What's your dreamhole like then?
Speaker 1: My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England.
Speaker 1: Really? I can't believe this. I am also keen on classic music. And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening?
Speaker 2: But I didn't get the ticket. And it is said that they were sold out yesterday.
Speaker 1: I got two. We can go there together.
Speaker 2: Amazing! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: I eat more and more these days. And it puts even more weight on me.
Speaker 1: It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning. What about trying something else?
Speaker 2: I'd love to do that. What do you recommend?
Speaker 1: More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days. Do you want to have a try?
Speaker 2: Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation?
Speaker 1: Absolutely. But it takes great perseverance to master.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: He said I should put on something very nice, Because this girl will be my next target.
Speaker 1: He knows you very well.
Speaker 2: He always makes fun of me. He always says things like that. You know the new coming teacher, A Chinese Canadian. He said she would really be my chance.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you have chances everywhere. You're handsome, Talkative, And got a sense of humor. You must be very popular.
Speaker 2: No, You're kidding. I'm not taking it seriously.
Speaker 1: And who's the man in the green beside her?
Speaker 2: You mean the man wearing jeans? He's her little brother.
Speaker 1: I think I'd say Norway. It has many pictures as fjords, Waterfalls, And mountains.
Speaker 2: Isn't it really cold there?
Speaker 1: Well, The north of Norway is almost always cold, But further south it can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, So there's snow almost everywhere in winter.
Speaker 1: What about sunday?
Speaker 2: I wish I could, But it's mymums birthday.
Speaker 1: Maybe next week.
Speaker 2: Much as I'd like to, I am afraid i wont be free next week, I have a lot of work.
Speaker 1: Sorry to hear that, I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you, I really enjoyed our last chat.
Speaker 2: I am really sorry too, Maybe I can give you a call sometime.
Speaker 1: School, You mean? Yes, He does. He likes his teachers, And that always makes difference.
Speaker 2: Yes, It does. Does he go to school by bus?
Speaker 1: No, He walks. He likes walking. He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together.
Speaker 2: What does he do when it rains?
Speaker 1: Oh, Do you like Chinese?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm eager to learn Chinese, But it is too difficult for me.
Speaker 1: I want to study German. Can we exchange lessons?
Speaker 2: Very Good. I'd like to do that.
Speaker 1: When will we begin?
Speaker 2: How about tomorrow night?
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 1: Then, Do you know her younger sister?
Speaker 2: You mean Mary?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Sure. I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary.
Speaker 1: Oh, Not bad. Then do you know her mother?
Speaker 2: Yes, Certainly. I know her mother and father, And brother and sisters, Too.
Speaker 1: That sounds terrific.
Speaker 2: Why do you ask me these questions?
Speaker 1: I just want to visit the family some day.
Speaker 1: Have you done windsurfing before?
Speaker 2: No, But it looks fun. I always wanted to try it.
Speaker 1: Can you take a little advice from a friend?
Speaker 2: Sure. What?
Speaker 1: Don't waste your money. Windsurfing is very hard. And it will be windy today. They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour, And you won't be able to windsurf. You will fall and fall and fall.
Speaker 2: But I always wanted to try it.
Speaker 1: Yes, But it takes a long time to learn. You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer.
Speaker 1: That's true, But my supervisor is very dishonest. There's no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth. I'm sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault, And there's nothing I can do about that. My boss won't believe me if I tell him the truth.
Speaker 2: Let's think realistically about what might happen. How much money do you have in your savings?
Speaker 1: I have enough to live off of for about 3 months. But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living! I'd rather invest my money somehow.
Speaker 1: My class is in the C building.
Speaker 2: I know where the C building is.
Speaker 1: Do you mind telling me where it is?
Speaker 2: Of course, Which room number is it?
Speaker 1: Number 261.
Speaker 2: I actually have a class right around there.
Speaker 1: Can you please show me?
Speaker 2: I can do that.
Speaker 1: I heard about a software program called turbid. It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction.
Speaker 2: Count me out. I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders.
Speaker 1: I couldn't even if I wanted to. My parents told me that if I went home, Then'd have to find my own place.
Speaker 2: You mean they're kicking you out?
Speaker 1: Not really, They just don't want me living at home. My older sister did that, And she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, It got harder and harder for her to move out.
Speaker 2: Well, It's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with, But they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so.
Speaker 1: My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well, And because of that, They want me to be more independent. They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own.
Speaker 1: Are you kidding me? Becky? She's a real bitch.
Speaker 1: Why can't we?
Speaker 2: It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, Then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, And I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon.
Speaker 2: But we can't have thirteen for dinner!
Speaker 1: Absolutely, I love temple fairs. Beijing has several temple fairs recently. They are different from each other to some extent, But also have a lot in common.
Speaker 2: I just can't wait to see them. Which one do you choose today?
Speaker 1: What about Tianqiao Temple Fair? A variety of opera performances, Acrobatics shows, And food will dazzle you.
Speaker 1: My daughter isn't feeling well.
Speaker 2: Oh, No. Is it serious?
Speaker 1: I don't know. Will you forgive me?
Speaker 2: Of course. I'm sorry for your daughter.
Speaker 1: Thank you. It's our first date. I hope it's not too offensive.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: That's because it's full.
Speaker 2: But I'm a new student here. I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class. I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office.
Speaker 1: Well, I could put you on a waiting list. But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class. What is your name?
Speaker 2: My name is Karen Huang. That's spelled H - U - A - N - G.
Speaker 1: Really? I love eccentric people.
Speaker 2: Yes, But he may be too eccentric even for you.
Speaker 1: Why? What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well, Haven't you heard?
Speaker 1: Heard what? No one ever tells me anything.
Speaker 2: Well, Apparently, He's been having an affair with his secretary.
Speaker 1: Really! How fascinating.
Speaker 2: According to Mary, He's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children. I thought everyone knew.
Speaker 1: Then he sent you to your home?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a romantic meeting. I can say that a hero saves a beauty.
Speaker 2: He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant.
Speaker 1: He is so humorous.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. What other languages can you speak?
Speaker 2: A little French.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 1: Well, Don't do this again next time. What is it about, Anyway?
Speaker 2: It is about sports for white-collar workers, People like you and me.
Speaker 1: What kind of sports?
Speaker 2: Aerobic sports, For example, Jogging, Yoga, Skating...
Speaker 1: Interesting. What were you reading just now?
Speaker 2: Stretching exercise after sitting a long time.
Speaker 1: Really? That sounds interesting!
Speaker 1: Do you like NBA?
Speaker 2: Yes, Of course.
Speaker 1: Who do you like best of the NBA players?
Speaker 2: Kobe.
Speaker 1: So do I.
Speaker 2: Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight, Shall we?
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Good! Where is it?
Speaker 2: It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?
Speaker 1: That would be great.
Speaker 2: Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun!
Speaker 1: The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything. And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation.
Speaker 2: Actually, We are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time. Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars, But they have looked at various designs.
Speaker 2: One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it. What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory?
Speaker 1: I'll pick you up here tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Yes, I will be there on time.
Speaker 2: We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?
Speaker 1: Yes, Someone is coming to get me.
Speaker 2: The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p.M. And return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p.M.
Speaker 1: What should we bring with us?
Speaker 1: Mr. : Right here is the cafeteria.
Speaker 2: It's huge!
Speaker 1: Mr. : But not big enough. And here is our computer room.
Speaker 2: There must be about 50 computers in here.
Speaker 1: Mr. : And over here is our gymnasium.
Speaker 2: Do I have to take gym?
Speaker 1: Mr. : Just like everyone else.
Speaker 1: But it's already awfully close.
Speaker 2: Well, I just hope it'll level off.
Speaker 1: I guess you can't do anything until after dark then.
Speaker 2: I guess so. What else can we do? You can't stay in the heat for long.
Speaker 1: I'm not really in the mood for Italian, Actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.
Speaker 2: If you want spicy food, Then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road?
Speaker 1: I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, They've westernized their food, So it's not actually that spicy.
Speaker 2: You're right. Most of their dishes have sweet sauces. We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us.
Speaker 1: It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow.
Speaker 2: How about you? What are you going to do tomorrow?
Speaker 1: I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house. How I envy you, Robin!
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 1: It's Greek to me.
Speaker 1: Speaking of The X-files, It's on right now!
Speaker 1: Nice to meet you, Too.
Speaker 2: Since we live in the same neighbourhood, Maybe we can help each other from now on.
Speaker 1: I guess so. I live next door but one, And hope you'll drop in now and then.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I will.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's the reason why I remain here.
Speaker 1: Sounds fine to me. Whatever, Let's enjoy this pond first.
Speaker 2: Sure. We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there. Hey, Look! There are some wild ducks over there in thereeds.
Speaker 1: Well, At least we have Stars. Com. That'll be great publicity.
Speaker 1: That's exciting, Man.
Speaker 2: So how did you propose?
Speaker 1: You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now.
Speaker 2: What do you think I should do?
Speaker 1: There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, Or ask her in a public area, Or if you have the balls, Ask her father in front of her.
Speaker 2: I never thought about that.
Speaker 1: I am so happy for them.
Speaker 2: Are you crying?
Speaker 1: Yes, I always cry at weddings.
Speaker 2: Harris and Anne are perfect for each other.
Speaker 1: Yes, They are.
Speaker 2: You and Tom also make a great couple.
Speaker 1: In fact, We are beginning to make preparations.
Speaker 2: For the wedding?
Speaker 1: No, No, For the engagement.
Speaker 2: Try to catch this bouquet then.
Speaker 1: Oh, That would be very useful.
Speaker 1: Where did you get that idea?
Speaker 2: Oh, Come on. Jane is a very nice girl, Someone you meet only once till lifetime.
Speaker 1: You are right. I am not boasting, But she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent.
Speaker 2: Well, I really envy you for finding such a nice girl.
Speaker 1: Yes, Sir. I'll bring your drink right away.
Speaker 2: It's not that. There's an animal in my soup.
Speaker 1: Is there, Sir? I'm very sorry. I'll change it straight away.
Speaker 2: I've never been to such a dirty restaurant, And never seen such slow service.
Speaker 1: I'm really sorry.
Speaker 1: This city is really comfortable to living.
Speaker 2: It sure is.
Speaker 1: No other city can match it. It's heaven.
Speaker 2: Well, If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much.
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 1: Is this your first date?
Speaker 2: Yes. I hope it pans out. Cross your fingers, Lily.
Speaker 1: Sure it will. Oh, No, It's seven fifteen already. I'm going to be late for my date.
Speaker 2: Oh... So you buried the hatchet with Steven?
Speaker 1: Absolutely not! He's a cheater. I will never talk to him again. I'm over with him. He's history!
Speaker 2: Then who will you meet tonight?
Speaker 1: That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, They look so cute!
Speaker 2: I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.
Speaker 1: That's all you ever think about, Food! Oh, I think the bride's coming now! She looks gorgeous. Wait, What's she doing? Where's she going?
Speaker 2: Oh great! Does this mean that the reception is canceled?
Speaker 1: Don't worry about that, I am sure they will understand. After all, It was a very difficult exam.
Speaker 2: What am I to do?
Speaker 1: You can always take it again.
Speaker 1: Really? Are you going to introduce us?
Speaker 2: Well, He has already taken you know, That's his wife right there.
Speaker 1: It is serious.
Speaker 1: Uh, I can see that. And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight.
Speaker 2: I've got something. You saw Taylor Smith? Looks terrible, Doesn't he? I heard he...
Speaker 1: Yes, I guess basic speaking in the English is easier.
Speaker 2: Maybe that's why your English is much better than my Chinese.
Speaker 1: I want to know where this relationship is going. I'm in love with you and I need to know...
Speaker 2: You know, I think you're awesome.
Speaker 1: I'm awesome. Well, I guess that's my answer, Isn't it.
Speaker 2: Honey...
Speaker 1: Look, If you don't love me, It's not a thing, Alright, We'Ve had our laughs, But I don't appreciate... Maybe it's just time we...
Speaker 2: Baby, I love you so much.
Speaker 1: You do?
Speaker 1: Yes, With a P.
Speaker 2: Er... I'm Barker.
Speaker 1: Barker? With a B. Of course.
Speaker 2: Yes, With a B.
Speaker 1: Won't you come in, Mr. Barker?
Speaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Parker.
Speaker 1: Where do we pay the fare?
Speaker 2: Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token. Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in.
Speaker 1: Let me pay for it.
Speaker 2: Where can I get the subway Madam?
Speaker 1: Well, What kind of movies do you like?
Speaker 2: Er, Let me see. Romance, Comedy, Documentary, Action, Science fiction, Cartoon and so on.
Speaker 1: In a word, You like all the movies except for the horror movies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned.
Speaker 1: Not quite. I also like romance and comedy movies very much.
Speaker 2: The Terminal is a movie of this type.
Speaker 1: And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service?
Speaker 2: It's really very good.
Speaker 1: Why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Well, Trains are frequent and come on time.
Speaker 1: Which train do you catch in the evening?
Speaker 2: I usually take the 5 thirty home.
Speaker 1: And can you get a seat?
Speaker 2: No, I usually have to stand.
Speaker 1: Would you agree that the service is fast?
Speaker 1: Oh, You look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'm on a diet, But I'Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I'Ve lost twelve pounds.
Speaker 1: Wow! That's great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, But it's difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, Old habits are hard to break.
Speaker 2: What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I'm taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday.
Speaker 1: What advantages does it have?
Speaker 2: It is very convenient. You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time.
Speaker 1: Yes, If we do business through other ways, It will cost a lot of time.
Speaker 2: Also it has low cost, And you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet, Which is very cheap.
Speaker 1: Yes, Going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much. But does it have any disadvantages?
Speaker 2: To be frank, Sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways.
Speaker 1: No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, But in other countries it is.
Speaker 1: That's good to hear.
Speaker 2: I'm just glad there were no complications.
Speaker 1: If your wife and baby are both happy, What more can you ask for?
Speaker 2: It's been a week, And I haven't slept that well.
Speaker 1: That's normal for anyone with a newborn.
Speaker 2: Yeah, But it's so hard. I have to work, And then go home and take care of my wife and the baby. I'm going to get sick at this rate.
Speaker 1: You'll get used to it. After everything stabilizes, You can regain your health.
Speaker 2: That's true. I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time.
Speaker 1: He sounds hot! What does he do for a living?
Speaker 2: You know what, This is the best part. David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, So he's got a great career path ahead of him!
Speaker 1: Hold on a sec, His name is David?
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning.
Speaker 2: Ok, Will do!
Speaker 1: But some classmates said you took the money.
Speaker 2: It is not true.
Speaker 1: Look at my eyes.
Speaker 2: Well, I confess. I did it, Because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill. I'm ashamed that I did that.
Speaker 1: Return the money to Jim and make an apology. I think he will forgive you.
Speaker 2: I will.
Speaker 1: Well missy, The white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.
Speaker 2: Ugh... So how long is this going to take? An hour?
Speaker 1: I'm afraid a bit more than that. We need to order the spare parts, Take apart your electrical system, Fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again. You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.
Speaker 1: It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing, In a park with the same name. There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer, So it is called 'Fragrant Mountain'.
Speaker 2: Have you visited it before?
Speaker 1: Many times. Except climbing, There are many attractions worth visiting.
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November. During the period, Thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area. The bright red, Pink, Scarlet, And peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout, With some green pines and cypresses dotted in between.
Speaker 1: And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, Or from the government.
Speaker 2: Wow, You'Ve inspired me to do something!
Speaker 1: Sounds nice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll probably just stay in and relax. Maybe watch a few movies.
Speaker 1: Can I stop by?
Speaker 2: Sure. Any time.
Speaker 1: Really? I'm surprised.
Speaker 2: Me too.
Speaker 1: In fact, I took up dancing quite recently, Too.
Speaker 2: Oh, Really? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you say so, You dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments. It's just that you are a good leader. Do you like thesamba and waltz?
Speaker 1: Yes. And what dances do you like best?
Speaker 2: Waltz is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances.
Speaker 1: We don't allow people to check out magazines.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: It's just a policy of ours.
Speaker 2: So what am I allowed to check out?
Speaker 1: You may check out books or videos.
Speaker 2: I need to check out this magazine.
Speaker 1: You will have to just read it in the library.
Speaker 2: That doesn't make any sense.
Speaker 1: Fred and David, My college class mates and Rachel.
Speaker 2: Gorgeous! What should I bring on that day?
Speaker 1: Your tent and enough food and water.
Speaker 2: You mean, We can do many other things after the picnic, Right?
Speaker 1: We can go fishing, Chatting and camping.
Speaker 2: What are we waiting for? Come on!
Speaker 1: Don't hurry. Wait for my call.
Speaker 1: Have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters?
Speaker 2: No, But I've always wanted to do that. I've heard it's a beautiful place to go.
Speaker 1: It's fantastic. My family and I are very fond of the place.
Speaker 2: Do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there?
Speaker 1: Sure, Would you like to see them?
Speaker 1: Not bad! Do you do any other sports?
Speaker 2: Not really. I'd really like to try golf, Though.
Speaker 1: And what's Montreal like? What did you think of it?
Speaker 2: Montreal is more exciting. It has better shopping. The stores are cheaper and more interesting.
Speaker 1: Which one has better nightlife?
Speaker 2: Oh, Montreal of sure. It has more restaurants and clubs. They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada.
Speaker 1: You know, Speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use.
Speaker 1: It's not easy, Particularly with listening and speaking, Because sometimes the connection isn't too good.
Speaker 2: I bet you find the character difficult to write!
Speaker 1: Actually, Many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, So they're easy for me.
Speaker 1: I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.
Speaker 2: Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester.
Speaker 1: Yes, I remember.
Speaker 2: Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?
Speaker 1: Sure, No problem.
Speaker 2: Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester!
Speaker 1: Which students go to private schools, Then?
Speaker 2: Children needing special instruction. Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools, And children whose parents want them to receive a religious education.
Speaker 1: But are the public schools good everywhere?
Speaker 1: I agree completely. I just don't understand what's wrong with them. Don't they have any humanity?
Speaker 2: Well, Maybe they've got a point. I mean, I suspect that they think the same about us.
Speaker 1: Yes, But that doesn't make them right, Does it? Just because they think so?
Speaker 2: I guess not. My view is that we should give in to their demands, So that innocent people can stop getting killed.
Speaker 1: Come on, You can't be serious! We should never give in to terrorist's demands, Otherwise where would we be?
Speaker 2: Well, That's probably true, But I don't think we should be dogmatic about it. A colleague of mine was kidnapped once, So perhaps I have a different view of things.
Speaker 1: I'd love to but I'm afraid I can't. I'Ve already got a lunch engagement.
Speaker 1: I've got an old Ericsson. Here. Take a look.
Speaker 2: Wow, That's really old.
Speaker 1: Yes, I like collecting antiques.
Speaker 2: Why don't you get a new one?
Speaker 1: I don't know. I like this one, And I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones.
Speaker 2: Really, What makes you say that?
Speaker 1: Well, I just need to make and receive calls, And it's quite reliable. I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things, The more likely they are to break bown or go wrong, You know? I mean, This camera function, For instance-how often do you use it?
Speaker 1: It wasn't cold out this morning.
Speaker 2: Well, It's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there!
Speaker 1: Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you?
Speaker 2: It does, Actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here.
Speaker 1: Yes. I'Ve bought all the things to go in it. It won't take long to make. How many people are coming to the party?
Speaker 2: I think everyone will be coming. Dave don't come because he has to go to his parent's home and they live in Scotland.
Speaker 1: Do we have Christmas pudding?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Our homeroom teacher has to take attendance again to make sure that we're all here.
Speaker 1: So he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I'm going to my locker to get my jacket. Catch you later.
Speaker 1: Oh. What was your major?
Speaker 2: Drama. I was an actor for five years after college.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. So why did you become a hairdresser?
Speaker 2: Because I needed the money. And because I was good at it. Look! What do you think?
Speaker 1: Have you booked the hotel for the reception?
Speaker 2: Yes. The Palace Hotel. You have to be there.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 1: Me, Too. At this time of the year, I often miss my home in the warm south.
Speaker 1: When you sent your emails, Did you attach any files to them?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did. There's an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments, So I'm sure I haven't sent anything nasty to anyone.
Speaker 1: When you use the internet, Be careful not to give out your email address very often. If you do, You might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things.
Speaker 1: So Irene, What do you do?
Speaker 2: I'm in computing. I work for Macrohard.
Speaker 1: Macrohard, Eh?
Speaker 2: What do you do?
Speaker 1: I have my own company that designs computer systems.
Speaker 1: Take care, Honey. I am always expecting you.
Speaker 1: Can you do the vault?
Speaker 2: I do back flips at the pool all the time.
Speaker 1: Please don't forget to say good-bye to the rest of the family for me.
Speaker 1: Really? What kind of problems?
Speaker 2: Well, Off the record, Of course, But I hear that he's got terrible debts. He has his own company, And it's not going very well.
Speaker 1: Really? Well, I hate to say this, But I'm not surprised.
Speaker 2: Really? What makes you say that?
Speaker 1: Well, He doesn't look very honest.
Speaker 2: I know, That's the problem. He can't find any customers. It's a pity, Really, Because his products are very good. Oh, That reminds me. Did I tell you about my new laptop?
Speaker 1: No. Worse than that. I have a flu. I'm in bed with a fever.
Speaker 2: Oh, No! What about your presentation today?
Speaker 1: I'd like to do it, Of course. But I just can't. I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it.
Speaker 2: I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley?
Speaker 1: Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.
Speaker 2: Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?
Speaker 1: Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out. Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that.
Speaker 2: Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too?
Speaker 1: No, The one you have on looks fabulous, Especially with your hair like that.
Speaker 2: Thanks for saying. Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear?
Speaker 1: With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect.
Speaker 2: Thanks for helping out. Now that I'm ready, What are you doing tonight?
Speaker 1: Not much, Just a house party with some friends.
Speaker 1: Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work.
Speaker 2: I don't mind the work. I think it's worthwhile.
Speaker 1: Since we're good friends, You don't have to pay me.
Speaker 2: No, I can't accept it. Business is business.
Speaker 1: I wish she wouldn't regret for her decision.
Speaker 1: Um — I was just thinking aloud.
Speaker 2: You look so happy. I see a twinkle in your eyes.
Speaker 1: Come off it, Mary.
Speaker 2: Oh, You have a crush on someone, Don't you? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes!
Speaker 1: You certainly do like teasing me, Mary. Well I'm in love with someone. The question is, How do I get his attention?
Speaker 2: Well, That's easy. Walk up to him and kiss him.
Speaker 1: I guess I asked the wrong person.
Speaker 1: You bet. I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home.
Speaker 1: I'm relieved to hear that. Anyway, It's my fault.
Speaker 1: Just because he gets on well with everybody?
Speaker 2: Partly, And he's also a hardworking man.
Speaker 1: Oh, We always go to the movies. Can't we do something different?
Speaker 2: Well, Do you have any suggestions?
Speaker 1: Let's see. How do you feel about playing bridge?
Speaker 2: It's OK with me, But we don't have any beer and things.
Speaker 1: Well, Shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over, And I'll go to the store and buy some stuff.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that. I thought that you were happy together.
Speaker 2: That isn't true. Actually, We have been separated for six months.
Speaker 1: I can't believe it. But if you both determine to divorce, I hope you will have an amicable split.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Steven. I accept your advice.
Speaker 1: Hello, Tom. I'm really glad to meet you here.
Speaker 1: Ok. Look, I've typed driver schools, And there are so many results coming out.
Speaker 2: Let me see. Teetee Training School, Summer program, 3, 000 Yuan, Learn how to drive within one month, And get driver's license within three months.
Speaker 1: 3, 000 Yuan is a little bit steep.
Speaker 2: I think so. Let's see the next one, 3, 500 Yuan, Summer program. Forget it.
Speaker 1: Are you in love?
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories.
Speaker 2: Well, Maybe.
Speaker 1: Well, I really like being with her.
Speaker 2: Have you thought about going in Dutch?
Speaker 1: Dutch, Where is that?
Speaker 2: Not where, What. Dutch means you both pay your own way.
Speaker 1: Oh, I wonder if she'll go for that.
Speaker 1: Are your free this weekend?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have nothing to do.
Speaker 1: Great, Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend?
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: I'd like to call on you this weekend. I just want to a drop in for a chat.
Speaker 2: Really? Well, Ok, You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Is 5 PM. A good time for you?
Speaker 2: Hmm, How about seven? I can treat you to dinner.
Speaker 1: Not that well. I've got that Monday morning feeling today.
Speaker 2: Why is that?
Speaker 1: My boss has been breathing down my neck all day. I can't wait for the weekend!
Speaker 2: Your boss is a real salve-driver, Isn't he?
Speaker 1: You can say that again! He won't even let us check our personal email at work!
Speaker 2: That's not just your boss. No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office.
Speaker 1: Can I help in anyway?
Speaker 2: You can take me to the bank if you want to.
Speaker 1: Sure. Let's go.
Speaker 1: I don't know what to suggest. There're so many attractions, And they all sound interesting. One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town. You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations.
Speaker 2: I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park.
Speaker 1: Then you can take Route No. 5. Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance, Dragon Boat racing, And many other water shows.
Speaker 1: I use those sites. Hey! Let's go check out a flea market later.
Speaker 2: Great! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping!
Speaker 1: Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station. It took me 20 minutes.
Speaker 1: Yes, But you only pay 800 dollars a month. Emm, It's hard to decide which is better, Shorter commuting time or lower rent.
Speaker 2: I thought paying a lower rent would be better, But now I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: I ride a motorcycle.
Speaker 2: That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card?
Speaker 1: I'll use a credit card, Thank you.
Speaker 2: Do you need a second permit for a car?
Speaker 1: No, Just the motorcycle permit.
Speaker 2: Fine, Here it is and have a great semester!
Speaker 1: How about one little hint?
Speaker 2: Here's one little hint. If you don't go out right now, This won't be under the tree.
Speaker 1: That's a very good hint.
Speaker 2: And please shut the door and lock it behind you!
Speaker 1: What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, He said he was coming.
Speaker 2: Kitty's? He sure gets around, Doesn't he?
Speaker 1: Looks like it. So how did he handle it to?
Speaker 2: His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again.
Speaker 1: I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.
Speaker 2: I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy.
Speaker 1: Doesn't sound promising.
Speaker 1: He did? That's too bad!
Speaker 2: I think so, Too.
Speaker 1: Next time you see him, Please tell him I'm thinking of him.
Speaker 2: I'll be sure to do that.
Speaker 1: What park? You found a doll in a park? Gross!
Speaker 2: South Park is a popular cartoon. You're so out of it, Jen.
Speaker 1: Well, Don't blame me! I never get a chance to watch TV.
Speaker 1: He got arrested all right.
Speaker 2: If I remember, He got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison.
Speaker 1: Yup, That's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.
Speaker 2: I think the government fined him a small amount, And he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire.
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail.
Speaker 1: I know that. But that has nothing to do with being unlucky. Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people.
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, The harder to make a decision.
Speaker 2: Toss a coin to decide then.
Speaker 1: Good idea!
Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Can I get you another glass of champagne?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'd love another glass. You're a wonderful host. Thank you for everything.
Speaker 1: It's my pleasure having you here.
Speaker 1: We will need it for Saturday only.
Speaker 2: I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?
Speaker 1: Mary and I will be driving the van.
Speaker 2: Could you drop it off on Sunday night?
Speaker 1: Yes, We can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?
Speaker 2: Yes, That would be fine. Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night.
Speaker 1: Come on, Dear. I know you mustn't forget it.
Speaker 2: It's Saturday, A great weekend.
Speaker 1: Ur, You really let me down.
Speaker 2: Don't be angry with me. I have a bad memory.
Speaker 1: No, You haven't. You just don't care about me. You're an indifferent husband.
Speaker 2: What day is it on earth?
Speaker 1: It's an anniversary of our weeding.
Speaker 1: Oh, Maybe you can find something from the New York Times, Or the Washington Post during that period.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: You are welcome.
Speaker 1: Nothing rang a bell.
Speaker 1: That's a long time! Was the weather OK?
Speaker 2: Yes, Most of the time. But it snowed a lot in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So, What was the best thing about your trip?
Speaker 2: Oh, That's difficult to say. But I guess I liked Nashville the best.
Speaker 1: Thanks, But I have to admit I am really good at bluffing!
Speaker 1: I've always wanted to go to Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top?
Speaker 2: That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them?
Speaker 1: Sure. What's this one a picture of?
Speaker 2: Oh, That's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city.
Speaker 1: Why? What does she want to be?
Speaker 2: She wants to be a manager.
Speaker 1: What classes does she take?
Speaker 2: She takes classes in accounting and business.
Speaker 1: Yeah, She is. She is pretty, Caring, Getting easy-going and she is a great cook. She is a gem.
Speaker 2: Well, You are right. But sometimes she is too caring. Well, No... She's just possessive and I kind of want a break... You know... For some room for myself.
Speaker 1: Oh?! Did you talk with her about it?
Speaker 2: I've tried, But it didn't work.
Speaker 1: Sure. I love this place, Especially the decoration. So tasteful!
Speaker 2: Yeah. Other than that, The real feature is the excellent drinks. Can I have your ticket?
Speaker 1: Here it is. But, What for? We're already in.
Speaker 1: I agree with you.
Speaker 1: Do you like it? It's Irish music.
Speaker 2: It's great! Where did you get the CD?
Speaker 1: Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall. Have you been there?
Speaker 2: Yes. I buy a lot of stuff from there. It's a good shop, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yes. Hey, I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland. Would you like to see them?
Speaker 2: Why not? I'd love to!
Speaker 1: If you gamble all night, You'll run out of money in a few days.
Speaker 1: What did you do last week?
Speaker 2: We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff. It was very exciting.
Speaker 1: Wow! That sounds like a lot of fun. I'm sorry I missed it.
Speaker 2: Well, You should come this weekend. I think you could do the climb.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will. See you then!
Speaker 2: O. K. See you.
Speaker 1: You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year?
Speaker 2: You should be able to find something comfortable in town, Though that would be kind of far from school.
Speaker 1: I got a car, So the distance wouldn't really be a problem.
Speaker 2: But the parking might be.
Speaker 1: Sure, What do you want to know?
Speaker 2: I have my book from class here. How do you say this word?
Speaker 1: Laptop.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't understand. What does that mean?
Speaker 1: A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you. Do you understand?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. Can you say it again?
Speaker 1: Laptop.
Speaker 1: What do you believe, John? Are you Christian?
Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I don't know if I'm a Christian or not. Christians don't often share the same belief. But I believe that we all possess, By the grace of God, The potential to create fantastic changes on this earth.
Speaker 1: Do you believe that one religion is better than another?
Speaker 2: No, All religions are essentially based on the same ideals, So no one is really better.
Speaker 1: It sure is.
Speaker 1: Alright, The puck is back in play now. Pavel Bure is on a breakaway! He is flying down the ice! The defenders can't keep up! Slap shot! He scores.
Speaker 1: I see. Thank you.
Speaker 1: My sister. She is going to her in-law's house this year.
Speaker 2: That's too bad. So, What did you ask for Christmas this year?
Speaker 1: I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games.
Speaker 2: I want some computer games also. I gave my parents a really long Christmas list.
Speaker 1: I hope that I get what I asked for.
Speaker 2: So what does your family do on Christmas Day?
Speaker 1: I'm pretty good. I've been looking for a place to live recently. My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the neighborhood. Have you found a place yet?
Speaker 1: Not yet. I am still looking through the classifieds. Wish me luck.
Speaker 2: Well, Maybe I can help. Remember my neighbor?
Speaker 1: Mrs. Thou?
Speaker 2: Yes, Her daughter's having a baby, So she's moving in with her to help out. I think if you are interested, You can come over and have a look.
Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do?
Speaker 2: Can I borrow some money?
Speaker 1: Sure, How much do you need?
Speaker 2: About 50 dollars.
Speaker 1: That's no problem.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I'll pay you back on Friday.
Speaker 1: That'll be fine. Here you are.
Speaker 2: What are you going to do now?
Speaker 1: I'm going to buy some books and then I'm going to the gas station.
Speaker 2: If you wait a minute I can go with you.
Speaker 1: Ok, Well, Let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: He sounds hot! What does he do for a living?
Speaker 2: You know what, This is the best part. David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, So he's got a great career path ahead of him!
Speaker 1: Hold on a sec, His name is David?
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: But why do you choose cycling at first?
Speaker 2: Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection.
Speaker 1: You are really a good citizen.
Speaker 2: That's what I can do.
Speaker 1: No, I tried to shake her hand, But her hand was so limp I was a bit offended.
Speaker 2: Well, Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan. She might have been offended by your strong handshake.
Speaker 1: But she was in America! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect?
Speaker 2: Things are different in Japan. You know, In some countries, Making eye contact with others is considered rude.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: That's not all. They use them! Every night men, Women, Children all out there till 3 and 4 a.M.
Speaker 1: Are you serious?
Speaker 2: I don't know how they function the next day! It's like they eat and breathe soccer!
Speaker 1: Sure, But you must have access to the Internet.
Speaker 1: Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn't mean all athletes are.
Speaker 2: Ok, Ok. I'm feeling a little dehydrated. Let's get something to drink.
Speaker 1: Oh really? I'll come along with you if that's ok.
Speaker 2: Sure, You're more than welcome. I'm meeting everyone at three o 'clock.
Speaker 1: Oh great, I'll see you there!
Speaker 1: What other expenses will we have?
Speaker 2: There won't be many other expenses expect food.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. How old is she?
Speaker 2: She's ten.
Speaker 1: I suppose they're playing games.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Ellie was playing games all day yesterday. By the way, Alice, When's your birthday?
Speaker 1: Today.
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, Imagine that! How old are you?
Speaker 1: Eighteen. Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight. Do you want to come?
Speaker 2: Very much. What time?
Speaker 1: Any marks on his face?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Glasses?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What about his hair?
Speaker 2: Black or dark brown.
Speaker 1: Long or short? Straight? Curly?
Speaker 2: Straight, I think, And about average length.
Speaker 1: Boy, This sure doesn't help us much. It could be anybody. How about his cloth? What was he wearing?
Speaker 1: Good. I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror!
Speaker 2: Oh, Don't. I'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever!
Speaker 1: Well, I don't see the point of arguing this.
Speaker 1: Online chat? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not?
Speaker 2: No, I am not. And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me.
Speaker 1: It sounds interesting.
Speaker 1: I understand that, But you'd feel better if you took a break, Even for just a short while.
Speaker 1: What about the expression Goodbye? Is that an idiom?
Speaker 2: That is just a natural, Grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.
Speaker 1: This is interesting, Ms. Parker.
Speaker 1: Oh. I'm just going to take it easy.
Speaker 1: I don't know. The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good.
Speaker 2: If your uncle had an alarm system, Then it wouldn't have happened.
Speaker 1: He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it. And on a crowded street too.
Speaker 2: Didn't anyone stop them?
Speaker 1: You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that. No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen. The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away.
Speaker 1: It says that it comes in teal andtangerine.
Speaker 2: Totally cool colors!
Speaker 1: And it says that it sleeps.
Speaker 1: Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?
Speaker 2: No, But I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home!
Speaker 1: What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her?
Speaker 2: I wanted to, But I knew that if I spoke to her, I'd just blow up at her, So I decided to just go home. I called her later that night, But she didn't answer the phone.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. All things are difficult before they are easy.
Speaker 2: You hit the nail right on the head.
Speaker 1: Well, Are you invested in some language-exchange program?
Speaker 2: What is it?
Speaker 1: I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, But staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: I didn't do anything. Finally, He left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.
Speaker 2: Did he leave when you left?
Speaker 1: Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.
Speaker 1: You are right, Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement, Costs, Etc. I think he must spend much money.
Speaker 2: Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon?
Speaker 1: Yes. Look! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'll try to catch it.
Speaker 1: Sorry, It's not available now. Anything else?
Speaker 2: We still prefer French dressing.
Speaker 1: Will you say it again?
Speaker 2: Who's your manager? Tell me! Would you?
Speaker 1: How do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months, In Japan. I am going to miss it so much, Cause I've had a great time here.
Speaker 1: Mm, So what are you going to miss about Japan?
Speaker 2: Oh, I am going to miss the people, The food, The night life. Especially the nightlife.
Speaker 1: What especially about the night life are you going to miss?
Speaker 2: Well, I really like dancing. And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London.
Speaker 1: Don't you see many people over there? Just on your left.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see them. Some are doing Taijiquan, Some are performing swordplay, Some are practising the Chinese Wushu.
Speaker 1: A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China.
Speaker 1: How about your one-year-old baby?
Speaker 2: I've asked my parents to live with us for a while, So they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class.
Speaker 1: How sweet of them! I have to work in the day time, Study at night, And do housework during my spare time. I really hope I have eight arms and legs, Like an octopus.
Speaker 1: I can understand. By the way, Is there anyway I can help?
Speaker 2: No, Not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's so great, Bless you! If you need me, I'll always be there.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: I work in marketing. I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company. Normally, I work out of Beijing, But I'm here on business. My friend Judy over there, She lives here and she invited me to this party. And you? How about you?
Speaker 2: I live here. I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there. He looks a bit drunk, Actually...
Speaker 1: Did it?
Speaker 2: It sure did. It was a heavy storm, With lots of thunder.
Speaker 1: I was fast asleep, And didn't hear a thing.
Speaker 2: Well, It may rain again later today.
Speaker 1: Maybe. I see some dark clouds moving in.
Speaker 2: There may also be a strong wind coming in.
Speaker 1: It'll be dusty, Too, I guess.
Speaker 2: Maybe not. Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 1: Well, Being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity. Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet?
Speaker 2: Yes, It wasn't too hard to get. All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee.
Speaker 1: You leave next Tuesday, Right? What time is your flight?
Speaker 1: Great! It's always better to do things with a friend.
Speaker 2: Do you have the phone number? I need to call for registration.
Speaker 1: No, I left it at home. Sorry!
Speaker 2: That's OK. I can get it from you later.
Speaker 1: So, Do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight?
Speaker 1: Well, You have three kids, So you knew what it meant once upon a time!
Speaker 2: Ha, Ha! Those days are long gone.
Speaker 1: That sounds terrible the way you describe it. But you know, Not long ago I really suffered on the bus.
Speaker 2: What happened? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus?
Speaker 1: I suppose the local one.
Speaker 1: Just so so. But we can travel twice every year.
Speaker 2: Is this time one of them?
Speaker 1: Yes, We won't travel again until October.
Speaker 2: Really? We have only one chance every year.
Speaker 1: I wish I could find one just like it.
Speaker 1: Did you guys go on a date already?
Speaker 2: No. I didn't even talk to her yet. But I think I'm in love.
Speaker 1: Does she have a boyfriend?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy.
Speaker 1: Dude, You're a stalker man. Just ask her on a date.
Speaker 2: I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone. I think I'll ask her then.
Speaker 1: So why do you think you're in love?
Speaker 2: She's the only thing I can think of all day long.
Speaker 1: Is it a used one?
Speaker 2: Yes, It is.
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive.
Speaker 1: Tea Ceremony! It's, There's a certain way you have to make tea, Not only make tea, There's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Yes, With one piece of cloth, And you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl.
Speaker 2: How do you learn that? Is that something that your mother would teach you? How do people learn that?
Speaker 1: There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you. You could do some research for a university. There's a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays. Someone wit.
Speaker 2: Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics, Because there are so many possibilities. Few people know where next discoveries will be made.
Speaker 1: Well, I hope scientists don't decode to make a clone of me in the future! I wouldn't like to be the subject of an experiment.
Speaker 1: New York Times is better?
Speaker 2: Yes, They have a good reputation for fairness.
Speaker 1: You'Ve been wasting your time on this? I can't believe it! It doesn't even look fun or challenging!
Speaker 2: My laptop is on my bed. If you think it's so easy then get on line and try to beat me.
Speaker 1: Fine!
Speaker 1: He's just got no idea of how good you are.
Speaker 1: Me, Too. I miss you. Are you any better?
Speaker 2: Yes. But if I have any more soup, I think I'll die.
Speaker 1: You are really a hen-pecked husband.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And that's so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational!
Speaker 2: Right. You can't blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs.
Speaker 1: In my country, There's a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown. I think it's about six minutes per hour.
Speaker 1: My pleasure.
Speaker 2: I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day, But the pre-sale tickets were sold out. How did you manage to get hold of them?
Speaker 1: A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi, Which is a major sponsor of the movie. He was able to get the tickets for free, And then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece.
Speaker 2: You paid 50 dollars for each ticket? That's a huge premium over the regular price.
Speaker 1: Mom, It's so terrible. Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned.
Speaker 2: Do be patient, Honey. Let's do it slowly and correctly.
Speaker 1: Oh, Mom, I think I'm not the right person for swimming.
Speaker 2: Come on, Sweetie, You've done very well. It is the first step that is tough.
Speaker 1: Right, I'll make up my mind. Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong.
Speaker 1: Woo, Easy.
Speaker 2: Leave me alone!
Speaker 1: What are you so ticked off about?
Speaker 2: I don't want to talk about it.
Speaker 1: Maybe I could help.
Speaker 2: I blew the finally exam.
Speaker 1: You've got be joking.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not.
Speaker 1: Well, Don't get bend on a ship about it.
Speaker 1: Over there are Stacy and Rebecca. We're all on the school's tennis team.
Speaker 2: Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone?
Speaker 1: That's my boyfriend Matt. Isn't he cute?
Speaker 2: He sure is!
Speaker 1: Come on. I'll introduce you two.
Speaker 1: Tomorrow? No, I am afraid I won't be able to. I'm going on business to Birmingham.
Speaker 2: What about Saturday?
Speaker 1: Sorry, I never go out on Saturday evening. I always watch football on Saturday evening.
Speaker 2: Will you come round next Tuesday?
Speaker 1: Next Tuesday? Just a moment. It will be the twenty-first of May? Oh, Dear. Hum, I promised my aunt I'll be at her birthday party.
Speaker 2: What do you say next Wednesday then?
Speaker 1: Let's keep in touch.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll drop you a line as soon as I get there.
Speaker 1: Yes, The one with the R $D team. Is that a problem?
Speaker 2: I will never go out with him anymore.
Speaker 1: Why did you say so?
Speaker 2: Last time when we had dinner at the Smith's, It was a horrible experience. He had no manners at all!
Speaker 1: Oh, Really?
Speaker 2: He made a lot of noises while eating. He talked with his mouth full andsipped loudly.
Speaker 1: Are you kidding me? How could he behave like that?
Speaker 1: I start next Monday.
Speaker 2: You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know.
Speaker 1: I know. I'm a little nervous, But it's pretty exciting.
Speaker 2: I bet. You must be stoked.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I'm going to celebrate tonight. Wanna hang out?
Speaker 2: Sure. It's on you right?
Speaker 1: Of course. How about Toby? Should we call him?
Speaker 1: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time!
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Honey, That was a great meal. I'm stuffed. Do we have any chips left?
Speaker 1: Let me see. Oh yes. Your professor has placed this book on reserve. That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place. You need to go to a special room called the reserve room. It's down the hall and to the right.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry - I still don't understand.
Speaker 1: You see, Your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter. If one student removes the book from the library, It is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it. So, Your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh my god! It's still there. We have our first date right on there.
Speaker 2: Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then?
Speaker 1: You seemed to be dull at that time.
Speaker 2: But you agreed to go out with me at last.
Speaker 1: ( Smile ) I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married.
Speaker 2: So do you feel happy now?
Speaker 1: I couldn't have been any happier!
Speaker 1: Thank you very much!
Speaker 2: How are your cases coming along?
Speaker 1: Very well, Thanks, I will probably finish next week, But this is still a lot of work, I have been worked on in for six months, And i'm so closed to end. I can fill in.
Speaker 2: Wow, Good for you. It sounds like a lot of work. I'm proud of you! Is this the red of building?
Speaker 1: Yes, It's only 8 forty. Thanks so much!
Speaker 2: You're welcome. Good luck, Bye!
Speaker 1: That will be great.
Speaker 1: Thanks for your belief.
Speaker 1: If you like, You can apply right now.
Speaker 2: That would be great.
Speaker 1: I'm going to need you to complete this application.
Speaker 2: What else do I have to do?
Speaker 1: Then I will take your picture for your passport.
Speaker 2: How long will it take?
Speaker 1: Your passport will be ready in a few weeks.
Speaker 2: Thank you. That's perfect timing.
Speaker 1: Well, You're really as out-dated as she is.
Speaker 2: You're darn right. I am out of style. So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style.
Speaker 1: No wonder you never buy me a new dress.
Speaker 1: Oh, God. I just forgot it. I should have brought roses for my girlfriend.
Speaker 2: It's not too late. Go to buy some now.
Speaker 1: Haha, Jogging? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring?
Speaker 2: You know what? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it. It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort. This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging. Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest, Which translates into inspirations. Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me. Sometimes, I even come up with a verse or two.
Speaker 1: I have both, But I usually use my car to get to school.
Speaker 2: Great, The price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash, Check, Or credit card?
Speaker 1: I'll pay cash.
Speaker 2: Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?
Speaker 1: No, Thank you.
Speaker 2: Ok, Here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester.
Speaker 1: I'm serious.
Speaker 2: All right. Next time you will treat.
Speaker 1: It's a deal.
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 1: That was such a touching speech. He must have really known Taylor well.
Speaker 2: Oh, How I wish this all wasn't happening!
Speaker 1: Sink?
Speaker 2: Oops. I meant, \"think\".
Speaker 1: Mary, You're going to have to work on your pronunciation.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: But give yourself some time. You just got here.
Speaker 1: That's my index finger!
Speaker 2: Oh, Right. This one, Right?
Speaker 1: Umm... That's the thumb, Nick.
Speaker 2: Okay, Okay, I got it! This is the ring finger!
Speaker 1: That's my middle finger, Nick. This is my ring finger!
Speaker 1: That's the one.
Speaker 2: His house must be worth millions! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford. The surrounding area is really peaceful, And getting into the city centre from there is very convenient. How can he afford that place?
Speaker 1: He didn't buy it. His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money.
Speaker 2: Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy?
Speaker 1: I know, I know. But someone took offence.
Speaker 1: Fortunately for you, You don't. Next time, If you have any questions about visas, You should try to find out before you get to the airport.
Speaker 2: That's good advice.
Speaker 1: Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat?
Speaker 2: Are there any seats available by the emergency exits?
Speaker 1: Let me see here... Yes, There's one left.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll take that one then.
Speaker 1: Yes, You're right. Good night.
Speaker 1: All right. Now that everybody's here. Shall we be getting started? Miss Lin, Are you ready?
Speaker 2: Yes, Thanks. Before I start, I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, Miss Lin. Would you mind speaking up, Please? I can't hear you very well.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I'll try to speak louder.
Speaker 1: That's tough indeed! Do you think your health can afford?
Speaker 2: I don't care. I need money.
Speaker 1: Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime, But do you think it's really worth?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes. Money comes faster in that way than otherwise.
Speaker 2: But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited. Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage.
Speaker 1: In my country, Many people enjoy golf, But it is too expensive for some people. A few people like extreme sports, But I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them.
Speaker 2: Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people. Several people from my university enjoy them, But most of us just watch. No one I know plays golf.
Speaker 1: I know loads of people who play it regularly. There are plenty of golf courses around the country. In the past, Only a tiny number of people played.
Speaker 1: She what?
Speaker 2: Oh don't worry, Sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I'Ve got it all planned out. There's almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending.
Speaker 1: Where are you going now.
Speaker 2: To the beach.
Speaker 1: Have you made your hotel reservation yet?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't need to do that. I'll be staying with friends.
Speaker 1: You're lucky. It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August.
Speaker 2: Just think, In a few days, I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy.
Speaker 1: Do you want to go to the beach there?
Speaker 2: Yes, Of course. And what's your plan?
Speaker 1: The same to you.
Speaker 2: That's great.
Speaker 1: I thought I did bad on the interview, But I guess I was wrong. I'm so happy right now.
Speaker 2: I bet. That's great news. I'm very happy for you.
Speaker 1: Thanks. I feel like celebrating. Let's go have a beer. It's on me.
Speaker 2: Sounds good.
Speaker 1: Me too, But I think we shouldn't drink too much of it, As it's not very healthy.
Speaker 2: I totally disagree. The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink. Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 'including diabetes, Heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver.
Speaker 1: But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content, Serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system, As well as other organs, And leads to addiction.
Speaker 2: I don't think so. Coffee helps me wake up, Keep alert, And improve my short term memory.
Speaker 1: Sorry, We have student cards. We can get discounts with these, Can't we?
Speaker 2: Sure. That'll be 40 yuan, Please.
Speaker 1: Here is 50 yuan.
Speaker 1: Who do you think it is?
Speaker 1: No, They live alone.
Speaker 2: On second thought, I think I'll join you.
Speaker 1: They'Ve just renovated the place. You may be surprised.
Speaker 2: Wow, They really went to town on this place!
Speaker 1: Quite a difference, Huh?
Speaker 2: Sure is. Waiter, Bring us two drafts, Please.
Speaker 1: Can I hold it for a moment?
Speaker 2: Sure. She is a peaceful child.
Speaker 1: Oh, How adorable! She's got your eyes.
Speaker 2: So they say.
Speaker 1: When are you returning home?
Speaker 2: Well. The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth.
Speaker 1: You can use some time off. You'Ve been working too hard anyway.
Speaker 1: Aw, Mom. I don't want fruit, Aren't there any chocolate chips?
Speaker 1: There must be buttons. How do they turn it on and off?
Speaker 2: I think it is centrally controlled. They control it at the main desk.
Speaker 1: Well, They have it too cold in here. I want to be warmer. I won't be able to sleep.
Speaker 2: I'm going downstairs for more drinking water. I will ask them.
Speaker 1: What did they say about the air conditioning?
Speaker 2: They said it is centrally controlled. All the rooms are the same. They can't change it.
Speaker 1: Let's go and get a coffee together. That will help you to wake up again!
Speaker 2: Ok. I feel like sitting down and having a chat. How have you been recently?
Speaker 1: Oh, You know me. I'm always happy! If I think I'm getting into a bad mood, I call some friends and socialize or have a chat.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody.
Speaker 1: You must be joking. You can't fall in love with someone you've never met!
Speaker 1: I think it's just a crush. You can't be serious.
Speaker 2: Well, This might be silly. But I just can't get him off my mind. And I can't help missing him.
Speaker 1: Did you tell him?
Speaker 2: Yes. He said I'm his dream girl.
Speaker 1: Oh, I am so sorry.
Speaker 2: That 'ok. That's happens all the time.
Speaker 1: No. I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night.
Speaker 2: Oh, Dad, I'm not a child. I'm 17 already. I'll come back as soon as the film is over.
Speaker 1: Ok. Here's the key. Take care.
Speaker 2: I will. Thank you, Dad.
Speaker 1: Great. Uh, Justin, Would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night? He's at the Kangaroo Club.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Karen, But I can't. I have to work late this Thursday.
Speaker 1: Oh... That's too bad.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I really like Lesley.
Speaker 1: Actually, Are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday? He's playing those two nights as well.
Speaker 2: Well, I can't make it on Friday either, But I'm free on Saturday night. What time does it start?
Speaker 1: At eight sharp. How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven?
Speaker 1: I know that, It's The English Patient. It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s.
Speaker 2: Well, Along with Jurassic Park! Nice going, You got the right answer.
Speaker 1: The coffee, Books, Music and sunshine are just beautiful there.
Speaker 2: How nice.
Speaker 1: I may take you there some day.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: Sure. Oh, That reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?
Speaker 2: My boots? Er... Sure, Ok.
Speaker 1: I basically believe in science over theology. I mean, I believe in evolution for example. However, There are many things that science hasn't explained yet.
Speaker 2: I'm sure that science will explain everything eventually. I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: Religions preach tolerance, But many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics.
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to like it here.
Speaker 2: You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use.
Speaker 1: Wow, I have my own bathroom!
Speaker 2: Kind of. It leads to my bedroom.
Speaker 1: We share the same bathroom, In other words.
Speaker 1: I kind of know where you live, But could you e-mail me your address?
Speaker 2: I can do that. Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party?
Speaker 1: I would really like to bring my friend Jake, If that would be OK.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I remember Jake. That would be fine.
Speaker 1: Would you like some help with the food?
Speaker 1: It is?
Speaker 2: You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business. And we don't even have a working demo yet.
Speaker 1: I can't take the credit for that. I'm just Zina's assistant. She's the pro.
Speaker 1: Then would you like to have lunch with us?
Speaker 2: I'd love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now.
Speaker 1: Would you like me to give you a lift?
Speaker 2: No, Thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there.
Speaker 1: Come on. It's no trouble at all.
Speaker 2: Ok, Thank you.
Speaker 1: Please. And in the mean time, Can I look at apartments available in the area from this office?
Speaker 2: Yes, Here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As.
Speaker 1: Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them?
Speaker 2: The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry. You can call them with any questions you may have.
Speaker 1: Here is a little gift for your family. It's a calendar with all the community events on it. I hope it can be helpful.
Speaker 2: I really appreciate it.
Speaker 1: Since we are neighbors, If you need any help or anything, Please come to me.
Speaker 2: I will. Actually, I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before.
Speaker 1: Oh, Don't worry about that here. There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood. You know, They are all very strong.
Speaker 2: Really? That's good. Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood?
Speaker 1: It's a little green post-it note, Stuck right in the middle of my computer screen.
Speaker 2: And? What does it say? Isn't there a name?
Speaker 1: It says, Zina, I like how you rhumba. An admirer.
Speaker 1: I don't think I can get up enough nerve to do this.
Speaker 2: Here. I'll just give you a little push...
Speaker 1: One of the girls in my office.
Speaker 2: What's the occasion?
Speaker 1: There is no specie occasion. She just likes to organize parties from time to time. This time it is a country theme.
Speaker 2: That's easy, How about a cowgirl? Oh I know even better, A Canadian Mountie.
Speaker 1: Well where am I going to get that sort of costume?
Speaker 2: Leave it to me. I know exactly where to find it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, It can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, But then I started going out, Keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.
Speaker 2: I see what you mean, But I'm still bummed out.
Speaker 1: Yes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.
Speaker 2: Sure. That's not a problem. Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Here's my list. I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.
Speaker 2: Yeah, That's perfect. What about the subjects for your minor?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not too worried about Vince, But I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver...
Speaker 1: Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital.
Speaker 2: Oh? What happened?
Speaker 1: His sister had a car accident last week.
Speaker 2: Is she fine now?
Speaker 1: She is still in a coma.
Speaker 2: Oh, Poor Alan! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year.
Speaker 1: How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree?
Speaker 2: Normally it can be completed in four years.
Speaker 1: If I do try to do anything, I'd only be sent off with a flea in my ear.
Speaker 2: If you really think so, In my opinion you should give up this feeling completely.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: I've been studying hard for my examinations. And you?
Speaker 2: I've been learning Japanese every evening.
Speaker 1: Why have you been learning Japanese? Why not English?
Speaker 2: I hope to visit Japan next year.
Speaker 1: Well, We'll both have to start learning all the new dances.
Speaker 2: Yes, Let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons.
Speaker 1: A good idea. They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us!
Speaker 1: I know several. But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size?
Speaker 2: Isn't that complicated?
Speaker 1: No, It's easy. We'll just take the shirt back to the men's department and show them the sales slip. They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund.
Speaker 1: Oh, How long?
Speaker 2: Down to his shoulders. It's beautiful, Like gold.
Speaker 1: Ok. Ok. You'd better tell me what he does.
Speaker 2: He's a very creative painter. His paintings sell well.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: He's quite a patient teacher, Too.
Speaker 1: Fine.
Speaker 2: You're going to like him. Everybody says he's a nice guy.
Speaker 1: I know. I know!
Speaker 2: Let's think this through. First of all, You cannot leave Amy at the altar. Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, But she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this? Second of all, You are just getting cold feet. You know deep down inside that you want to marry her, So cut the crap and do it!
Speaker 1: Yes. I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting \"April Fool, April Fool\".
Speaker 2: Oh, Your classmates took you in.
Speaker 1: Only then did I realize it was April Fools 'Day.
Speaker 1: For me, I think starting school was more exciting.
Speaker 2: Does that mean work isn't that great?
Speaker 1: It's different for everyone, But because I knew school was going to be so much fun, I really got excited about it.
Speaker 2: But work is a huge portion of our lives. I'm looking forward to making it fun.
Speaker 1: That's a great attitude to have. I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce.
Speaker 1: Yeah. The final is next week. You have to watch it.
Speaker 1: Why would you say that?
Speaker 2: They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan. There are a lot of cultural differences to account for.
Speaker 1: I'll say! Sometimes they just do things really differently. But one thing I can say, They are really hospitable.
Speaker 2: Have you ever been to Japan?
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's pretty cold, Alright.
Speaker 2: Did you catch the news this morning? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street.
Speaker 1: No, I didn't hear about that.
Speaker 2: Did you happen to watch the football game last night? The Patriots scored in the last minute!
Speaker 1: No, I don't like football.
Speaker 2: Oh... By the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party. She is really beautiful!
Speaker 1: She's my wife! Oh, Here's my floor! Nice talking to you. Goodbye.
Speaker 1: What was the score?
Speaker 2: Seventy to sixty-seven.
Speaker 1: This is all you want to check out?
Speaker 2: Just the video.
Speaker 1: I'm going to need your library card.
Speaker 2: I have it right here.
Speaker 1: You'll need to take care of the video.
Speaker 2: I will.
Speaker 1: We will fine you if you damage it.
Speaker 2: I get it. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Oh. Really? I saw it two years ago. It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I found it is so close to our life.
Speaker 1: It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world.
Speaker 2: You said it. You know, The divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year.
Speaker 1: Well, It's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too.
Speaker 2: I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married.
Speaker 1: What? In your cubicle?
Speaker 2: Right here. Me and my PC. Home sweet home.
Speaker 1: There is something wrong with this dish.
Speaker 2: What's wrong?
Speaker 1: I don't think this is fresh.
Speaker 2: They were delivered this morning.
Speaker 1: Would you please ask the manager to come over?
Speaker 1: Really? I hope we will do much better under her guidance.
Speaker 2: I am sure we will.
Speaker 1: I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me.
Speaker 2: Yes, There are always pros and cons to making a career change.
Speaker 1: Also, The matter of pay is also a consideration.
Speaker 2: I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it. The benefits are much better.
Speaker 1: Yes, Sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice.
Speaker 1: What about restaurants and entertainment?
Speaker 2: There are restaurants with food from all over the world. We have a small china-town near the city centre. There are many Indian, Thai, And Italian restaurants all over the city centre. There are many sports events in my city. We have several sports venues for football, Rugby, And cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey.
Speaker 1: Is there a lot of nightlife in your city?
Speaker 2: There are several good clubs near the city centre. Many people in my city prefer something more 'cultural ”, So we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas.
Speaker 1: Anything else?
Speaker 2: Besides the turkeys, We'll also have other delicious food. Such as pumpkin pies, Puddings, Mashed potatoes, Bread, A lot of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Speaker 1: I'm almost hungry.
Speaker 1: What do you do, Susan?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a college student. How about you?
Speaker 1: I work for the Bank of China, In the International Section.
Speaker 2: I work for the Bank of China, In the International Section.
Speaker 1: Oh, Come on! I just gave them my e-mail, My address and my phone number. And my name, Of course.
Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I like to pamper myself, And my nails look great. You should come with me!
Speaker 2: Why? I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that!
Speaker 1: They don't only paint my nails! The manicurist will remove my cuticles, File my nails, And apply at least nails coats of nail polish!
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sounds like something I should definitely do.
Speaker 1: The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school. It gives you discounts on all kinds of things. Movies, Pizza, Clothing, School supplies.
Speaker 2: What about beer?
Speaker 1: The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer. But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges. So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club, You get a discount on the entrance fee.
Speaker 2: That's pretty cool. How much of a discount?
Speaker 1: Usually it's two dollars off the cover price.
Speaker 1: Well, Maybe you could tell them about my promotion.
Speaker 2: You've been promoted? When did that happen?
Speaker 1: Just today. I guess I forgot to mention it.
Speaker 2: Congratulations! That's really exciting! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate!
Speaker 1: Shouldn't we finish writing this letter first?
Speaker 2: Ah. That can wait. Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time!
Speaker 1: I'm going to have to charge you for the damage.
Speaker 2: How much?
Speaker 1: It's only $ 5.
Speaker 2: That's not too bad.
Speaker 1: I know it's not.
Speaker 2: Here's the money for the book.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your payment.
Speaker 2: You are very welcome.
Speaker 1: Don't you like games.
Speaker 2: I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends.
Speaker 1: Me too. Recently, I've made many friends on the net. Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them.
Speaker 2: Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money?
Speaker 1: In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that. The streets are often icing in the morning. With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms.
Speaker 2: Yeah, We do. In the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon. I heard your city has a lot of fog, Is that true?
Speaker 1: We do have a few foggy days in winter. But i would not say we have a lot of fogs. The sky are usually clearly over your city, Are they?
Speaker 1: There are lots of jobs, And almost everybody works. There is a high standard of living. People earn a lot, But they spend a lot to live. So there isn't so much money after all.
Speaker 2: But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do.
Speaker 1: That's true. But Americans work hard for their money like we do. I don't know why our spending habits are so different.
Speaker 1: When I'm old, I'll also be like that.
Speaker 2: You need a child first, And that's your duty, Too.
Speaker 1: I know that's what I must do.
Speaker 1: What is the matter?
Speaker 2: I am a little worried about my host family. You know, In the agreement, I have to do some cooking for them.
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: Well, I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking.
Speaker 1: Oh, Listen, You'll soon learn, And I am sure they will explain to you how they like to get prepared.
Speaker 2: Oh, Let's hope so.
Speaker 1: Well, One of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects. State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes, So audiences have high expectations for this one, And I don't think they will be disappointed.
Speaker 2: You are right. The special effects were amazing. And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes, Weapons and creatures.
Speaker 1: It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie.
Speaker 1: Where'd you meet him?
Speaker 2: Oh, Listen, I can't even remember. Ok, On my birthday, I wandered into over 30 rooms, For a joke, Sort of and he was there, And we started chatting...
Speaker 1: About what?
Speaker 2: Oh, Books, And music, How much we both love New York. Harmless, Harmless, Meaningless. Bouquets of sharpened pencils. Oh.
Speaker 1: Oh, God. I just forget it.
Speaker 2: I thought you had trouble with Clive!
Speaker 1: No. But now he will be in bigger trouble! What's a boyfriend for? Forget about Valentine's Day?
Speaker 2: Poor guy! It's not fair. You forgot it too.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's Clive.
Speaker 2: Wow! Good timing.
Speaker 1: Excuse me for a while. Clive asked me out to a movie! Do you want to join us?
Speaker 2: Come on. Two is company.
Speaker 1: So what?
Speaker 1: He has a mustache, If I remember correctly, And a light complexion.
Speaker 2: How old is he?
Speaker 1: He is in his late thirties.
Speaker 2: Well. I shouldn't have any trouble recognizing him. What time does his flight arrive?
Speaker 1: At two thirty.
Speaker 1: What on earth are you talking about?
Speaker 2: I got caught cheating. I feel so ashamed. The teacher saw me and told me I failed.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking?
Speaker 2: You know my father. If I fail, He'll kill me. I have to do well.
Speaker 1: But what you should do is study hard.
Speaker 2: I know... I know... It's all my fault. I feel awful that I didn't study, And I cheated, And I got caught.
Speaker 1: So long as you learn from your mistakes.
Speaker 1: Fine, Thanks. I've been busy lately.
Speaker 2: What have you been doing?
Speaker 1: I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month.
Speaker 2: Really? Good luck for them.
Speaker 1: Thanks. And how are your parents?
Speaker 2: They're both very well, Thanks.
Speaker 1: Where are you going now?
Speaker 1: Glad to meet you, Ms. Baker.
Speaker 2: Glad to meet you, Too.
Speaker 1: Where are you from, Ms. Baker?
Speaker 2: I'm from New Zealand.
Speaker 1: What do you do for a living?
Speaker 2: I'm a teacher.
Speaker 1: Thank you for coming, Ms. Baker.
Speaker 1: I was too excited to sleep last night. I didn't go to sleep until quite late.
Speaker 2: Then when did you go to sleep?
Speaker 1: About 2 o 'clock in the morning.
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: About 2 o 'clock.
Speaker 2: Oh, Susie. Didn't I tell you over and over again that you wouldn't be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep?
Speaker 1: You did, But I can't help it.
Speaker 2: This is a one-day trip. We'll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home. Which one do you choose?
Speaker 1: I never knew that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, More people need to take public transportation or carpool.
Speaker 1: Well, We'Ve already done our part.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It's your turn to drive next week. Don't be late picking me up.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm getting more sleep these days. The baby's finally growing up a little more.
Speaker 2: Well, Give me a call if you can't make it for some reason.
Speaker 1: I'm your wife, Not a housewife. I have my own work.
Speaker 2: Hum...
Speaker 1: In fact, They're both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, Since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.
Speaker 2: Oh, Right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It's hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?
Speaker 1: It's still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.
Speaker 1: I'm clear so far.
Speaker 2: The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in.
Speaker 1: It won't go in!
Speaker 2: Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work.
Speaker 1: Yes, Next step.
Speaker 2: Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that reliable.
Speaker 1: They're totally unreliable.
Speaker 2: You seem to have it down. Have a good day!
Speaker 1: I'll have the leg of lamb.
Speaker 2: And would you like salad? The salad plate today is lettuce, Tomatoes, And black olives.
Speaker 1: Was it on the shelf?
Speaker 2: It should have been, But it wasn't.
Speaker 1: Maybe someone took it.
Speaker 2: Will you be getting another copy anytime soon?
Speaker 1: I'm sure we will.
Speaker 2: Would you be able to reserve it for me?
Speaker 1: I sure will.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: I never chatted online before. What's it like.
Speaker 2: Well, Basically it's similar to face-to-face chat, But you type instead of talk. You should try it at least once.
Speaker 1: Really? Who do you chat with?
Speaker 2: To people all over the world! I have a lot of net pals. See, The magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world. You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were.
Speaker 1: No, You are wrong. Money can't buy happiness and health. I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money. In other words, I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. But a proverb says \"Money makes themare go.\" I think it will be better if you have more money.
Speaker 1: Maybe you are right. Please take care of yourself when you make money. Anyway health is the most important thing.
Speaker 1: No, I haven't began my preparations.
Speaker 2: Then shall we make preparations together?
Speaker 1: Great. You can help me a lot with English.
Speaker 2: All right. But I am very poor at math. Would you like to help me with my math?
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 1: So beat the cat, But don't kill it.
Speaker 1: I was happy to help.
Speaker 2: It was so kind of you.
Speaker 1: Don't mention it.
Speaker 2: You're a real friend in need.
Speaker 1: I must catch the nine-thirty train.
Speaker 2: You've plenty of time yet. The railway station is very close. It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there.
Speaker 1: But it's very tired.
Speaker 2: I don't care.
Speaker 1: What's your parents 'opinion?
Speaker 2: I haven't told them. Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation.
Speaker 1: Yes, On a business trip. How about you?
Speaker 2: I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there. Have you ever been there before?
Speaker 1: Yes, I went there once last summer.
Speaker 2: Really? What did you think?
Speaker 1: I think it is amazing. You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway.
Speaker 2: Was it that crowded?
Speaker 1: Yes. There were always so many people. After taking the subway during the rush hour, You'll envysardines in their cans.
Speaker 1: We plan to get together once a week.
Speaker 2: What days, Do you know?
Speaker 1: We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library, From seven to eight.
Speaker 2: Okay, Count me in.
Speaker 1: It's OK. Don't worry about it. Our school coach will train us to play basketball.
Speaker 1: I was happy to help.
Speaker 2: It was so kind of you.
Speaker 1: Don't mention it.
Speaker 2: You're a real friend in need.
Speaker 1: What is on the program?
Speaker 2: It's a piano solo. I'm fond of piano, You know.
Speaker 1: Hah! Ok. Let's go together!
Speaker 2: Let's meet at the park at 6:00.
Speaker 1: See you then.
Speaker 1: Do you like this place?
Speaker 2: I don't think it's very nice. And my father doesn't like it. But my mother likes it very much. So we often come here.
Speaker 1: How often?
Speaker 2: Well, We come here almost every month.
Speaker 1: Who's that?
Speaker 2: It's my mother. She's fond of swimming. And the man beside her is my father.
Speaker 1: Do you like swimming?
Speaker 2: No, I hate swimming. I prefer playing tennis.
Speaker 1: Wow, Isn't that dangerous?
Speaker 2: A little, But the rush was worth it.
Speaker 1: Tell me about it.
Speaker 2: We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us.
Speaker 1: 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It was scary but exhilarating.
Speaker 1: I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit, This sure is a nice spring day.
Speaker 2: Hey, This spot in the shade looks really comfortable.
Speaker 1: Okay. Hey, Is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I say the weather report last night, And it said the weather should be fine all day.
Speaker 1: I think it is the worst one I have ever seen.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure I agree with you. It was not a good one, But it was not the worst one. Actually, It wasn't too bad.
Speaker 1: I can't think the same.
Speaker 2: What's more, Some scenes were good, Much fit for the children.
Speaker 1: I couldn't agree with you.
Speaker 1: I was sick.
Speaker 2: Oh, Okay. Well, Here you go.
Speaker 1: Are these all of them?
Speaker 2: Oh, Wait, Here are the rest.
Speaker 1: Thanks a bunch.
Speaker 2: Don't mention it.
Speaker 1: Sure, Let's do it.
Speaker 2: Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right?
Speaker 1: I don't see any mistakes.
Speaker 2: Ok, Now that we've gotten those straightened out, Let's total the score.
Speaker 1: Yes, Let's total it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Stay home Sunday. But Friday we should go out dancing.
Speaker 2: Do you feel like dancing?
Speaker 1: Yes? Why not?
Speaker 2: Alright. At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends.
Speaker 1: They aren't alcoholic!
Speaker 2: No, Maybe they're not. But they're close.
Speaker 1: So where should we go?
Speaker 1: I am better. I will go out to have a visit to my aunt. Why don't we have fun on weekend?
Speaker 2: So what?
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom...
Speaker 1: They don't have toilets at the campground?
Speaker 2: Let's just say I'll have it easy...
Speaker 1: Well, I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E. Rd. ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yes. And suddenly I heard someone call my name. I turned around and there was this man looking at me. I didn't recognize him at all, But he obviously knew who I was.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Why don't you take some aspirin?
Speaker 2: I'Ve already tried some but it didn't help.
Speaker 1: Well, It's necessary for you to see a doctor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I should.
Speaker 1: Well, You'd better get some rest.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition. If you can't beat'em, Join'em.
Speaker 1: It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks, But it is spacious and bright.
Speaker 2: Do you get along with your roommates?
Speaker 1: Of course. They are very friendly.
Speaker 2: Which floor are you on?
Speaker 1: We are on the 5th floor, And there's a very nice view from the balcony.
Speaker 2: Oh, You can climb the stairs as a workout.
Speaker 1: Yes, That's a good idea.
Speaker 2: Wow, Your roommates are cleaning the room.
Speaker 1: New England.
Speaker 2: That's still too far for me.
Speaker 1: Julia, I really love you. I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future.
Speaker 2: Your way does touch my heart.
Speaker 1: So, Will you marry me?
Speaker 2: I want to think of it for some time.
Speaker 1: Not at all! That explains everything!
Speaker 1: So do we have to stay in this English class forever?
Speaker 2: No. You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation. Then you go on practicing and learning outside. A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation.
Speaker 1: So it's really the same story. Practice, Practice, Practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language.
Speaker 2: You said it.
Speaker 1: Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned! That may be true, But if you were to do it, You would have trouble on the horizon. You always say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, You never look at the positive side of things.
Speaker 1: Okay. Have it your way, But don't say I didn't warn you.
Speaker 1: Happy to know you, Tim.
Speaker 1: Good idea, Betty. What would you think about the second part?
Speaker 2: I think it's too short. You'd better say something about your work experience.
Speaker 1: You're right, I'll change it. How about the last part?
Speaker 2: Very good. But you should talk about your family, Too.
Speaker 1: You know. Tests like how jealous are you? And are you a fashion victim?
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. I like to do those tests, Too, But I don't take them seriously.
Speaker 1: Of course not, But sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do. According to the jealousy test, I'm quite a jealous type of person. Perhaps I need to control my jealousy.
Speaker 1: Ok, Ok. Enough already. We'd better hustle. The contest starts in five minutes.
Speaker 1: That's a great idea. Let's go... Oh, The dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful.
Speaker 2: I'm glad you like it. The band is called \"Four and One\". They are especially good at playing rock and roll.
Speaker 1: That's great! I love to dance to fast music.
Speaker 2: Then you must be interested in disco dancing, Aren't you?
Speaker 1: Yes, Disco dancing is my favorite. It's great fun and good exercise as well.
Speaker 2: Ok. Let's disco.
Speaker 1: By the way, How's the nose? Boy, That must have hurt.
Speaker 1: Why don't you apply for one right now?
Speaker 2: Sure. That would be great.
Speaker 1: Please fill out this application.
Speaker 2: Okay. Here you go.
Speaker 1: Now, Sign your name on the back of the card.
Speaker 2: Here you go.
Speaker 1: Here's your library card.
Speaker 2: Thanks. Now I'd like to check out this book.
Speaker 1: No, Not at all.
Speaker 2: First of all, It's a romance novel, Set in the early 19th century.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize it was a romance novel. What's the main storyline?
Speaker 2: It's basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls.
Speaker 1: Why does he want to do that?
Speaker 2: Since he doesn't have a son, He hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man. That way, All of his daughters will be cared for.
Speaker 1: What about the expression \"goodbye\"? Is that an idiom?
Speaker 2: That is just a natural, Grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.
Speaker 1: This is interesting, Ms. Parker.
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 2: One more thing, Keep your desk neat. It's the rule. There is no exception, Even the art designers have to keep their desks neat.
Speaker 1: I'll keep that in mind. Does everything on the desk belong to me?
Speaker 2: Not belong. You can use them as long as you work here. When you quit, You'll have to return them to the company.
Speaker 1: What's the extension number for my phone?
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 2: And Roman really loves life. He knows how to enjoy himself.
Speaker 1: Not always. But they like good meal.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: How can I go there to have a taste?
Speaker 2: By air of course.
Speaker 1: Sounds like a good idea, But a band sounds too expensive.
Speaker 2: Well, We can ask people to make small contributions.
Speaker 1: We haven't come here in business but for pleasure. We should go out exciting. What can you see in the subway? Nothing!
Speaker 2: What can you see from a tram or a double-decker?
Speaker 1: I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk. I can see cars driving on the streets. I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind. I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air.
Speaker 2: But they are not as convenient as the subway.
Speaker 1: We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily. And if you come back to office, You just reconnect your laptop with docking station.
Speaker 2: What docking station?
Speaker 1: This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk. The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments, Like fax, Copier, A screen, Printer and scanner, And it will be very convenient.
Speaker 2: Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment, I don't need a desktop anymore. A laptop is enough.
Speaker 1: John made out with other girls at the party yesterday.
Speaker 1: I think I am doing great, Except for that one test!
Speaker 2: Well, Your scores show that you could do a little better. What do you think you could improve on?
Speaker 1: I think that I could study a little harder for tests.
Speaker 2: Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll do fine.
Speaker 1: I feel much better, But I'm still worried about something.
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Well, I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning, And I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic.
Speaker 2: That's annoying, But nothing to worry about.
Speaker 1: For me, Traffic jams are quite stressful, Because I'm pretty impatient. How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam?
Speaker 1: Ok, An Englishman, A Scotsman, And an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert, And they could only take one thing with them.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment.
Speaker 2: Oh, That's funny!
Speaker 1: Hang on, I haven't finished yet.
Speaker 2: Oh, Sorry.
Speaker 1: Well, As I was saying, They showed each other what they had decided to bring. The Englishman had brought some water. \"If we get thirsty, We'll have something to drink,\" he said. The Scotsman brought a map. \"If we get lost, We'll be able to find our way.\" The Irishman had brought a car door.
Speaker 2: A car door? You mean just one car door?
Speaker 1: Yep. A car door. \"Why the door?\" the others asked him. \"Well,\" he said, � If it gets hot, We can open the window. \"Do you get it?
Speaker 1: Traveling, Swimming, Going to the cinema. And you?
Speaker 2: I like painting, Sailing, Watching football and talking to you.
Speaker 1: I like talking to you too.
Speaker 2: Do you want to go to an Exhibition? There's one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.
Speaker 1: Oh, So he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, Then?
Speaker 2: Right now he speaks mostly Chinese, And he can say a few English words. But he will learn.
Speaker 1: What does he look like? Can people tell?
Speaker 1: Well, Good for you. I hope you can get what you want from the training.
Speaker 2: I will do my best.
Speaker 1: Oh, I haven't noticed that before. Maybe I will try next time.
Speaker 2: Why don't you go ahead of me? I have more items than you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. In fact, I am in a hurry. My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot.
Speaker 2: You're welcome. It was good seeing you again.
Speaker 1: Me too. Have a great day.
Speaker 1: I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone.
Speaker 2: Yes, That's right. So far, Only small deposits have been found. Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil. The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country.
Speaker 1: If your government invests in your country's infrastructure, It will be money well spent.
Speaker 1: It's Asian fusion. I heard it's delicious.
Speaker 2: Oh really! That sounds lovely.
Speaker 1: She liked the acting, Too, Because that's what she wanted to see.
Speaker 2: I wasn't happy with it.
Speaker 1: Nothing is to your satisfaction.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself.
Speaker 1: I... I... I miss my parents, Also they miss me.
Speaker 2: Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, And you didn't say anything about it.
Speaker 1: You mean I am groaned a few words?
Speaker 2: Totally not. Perhaps it's about our marriage.
Speaker 1: Exactly. Herry is almost broken now.
Speaker 1: Yes. Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead?
Speaker 2: That's the one. It's an actioncomedy. What do you think?
Speaker 1: To be honest, I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead. Besides, I like movies with a happy ending best.
Speaker 2: What do you have in mind?
Speaker 1: I was thinking of seeing You, Me and Dupree. It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster.
Speaker 1: Well, We could go to a movie. Have you see Shrek 2?
Speaker 2: I have, Actually. How about the movie, Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood?
Speaker 1: Hmm... I'Ve seen that, Too. We could go for a walk in the park.
Speaker 2: We could, But it looks like it's going to rain soon.
Speaker 1: I guess that's out. Why don't we go shopping?
Speaker 2: I'd really rather not. I'll be too tempted to buy something that I can't afford!
Speaker 1: What color are her eyes?
Speaker 2: They're dark gray.
Speaker 1: What color is her hair?
Speaker 2: It's blond.
Speaker 1: And how old is she?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: I can understand. By the way, Is there anyway I can help?
Speaker 2: No, Not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's so great, Bless you! If you need me, I'll always be there.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Really? That's the icing on the cake. Congratulation again!
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: I once went to Singapore by air. It was very exciting-but never again.
Speaker 2: Why? Did you feel frightened?
Speaker 1: For a short time. One of the engines caught fire.
Speaker 2: What did the pilot do?
Speaker 1: He put it out and flew back to the airport. Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was.
Speaker 2: Did you land safely?
Speaker 1: Why? Are you kidding me? A guy like that is hard to find. Few boys are so caring, So patient, And did I mention he is hottie?
Speaker 2: You really think so?
Speaker 1: Totally. I am saying it from the bottom of my heart! And it's obvious that he's head over heels in love with you, Too.
Speaker 2: I sure hope so.
Speaker 1: Wow, With such a big change. We won't have the same name?
Speaker 1: Just take it easy. Come on with me.
Speaker 2: I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you. Shall we find some other time?
Speaker 1: In that case, Let me make a quick change into my street clothes.
Speaker 2: I'll wait right here for you Superman.
Speaker 1: Ta da! Let's go to the Ritz!
Speaker 2: Can we go to the Carlton next time and can you wear that fabulous suit?
Speaker 1: That's my uncle. You're my cousin! Hi cousin!
Speaker 2: It's really a small world, Isn't it! The Hammer family isn't very big.
Speaker 1: It really is. Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up?
Speaker 2: I always make time for family.
Speaker 1: It's there by the window.
Speaker 1: She was a very controversial leader. Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later?
Speaker 1: If I were her, I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love.
Speaker 2: But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough.
Speaker 1: Well, My dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth.Davi called me this morning.
Speaker 2: So when did this happen?
Speaker 1: Last weekend, While they were on the Sik trip.
Speaker 2: Well, I believe it now, And when are they are getting marry?
Speaker 1: Next june.
Speaker 2: I can hardly believe it.
Speaker 1: I have a good solution... We need some new blood! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders!
Speaker 1: I know. The economy here is having serious problems. But because the government declared a default, The currency value went way down.
Speaker 2: So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much.
Speaker 1: Yes, It's an amazing drop.
Speaker 1: No, Fireworks are awesome!
Speaker 2: Whoa, Don't you remember? Last year when I set off the firecrackers, You covered both your ears and hid behind your mother?
Speaker 1: Have you forgotten the cheers?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't. I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly.
Speaker 1: That's good!
Speaker 1: You have to. It's sure.
Speaker 2: How amazing!
Speaker 1: Oh, Is that all?
Speaker 2: I feel very nervous about it.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. Try to look on the bright sight of things.
Speaker 1: We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible.
Speaker 2: That's true. I think zoo are a good idea, Because they allow people to get close to animals. I think it's good for kids to see wild animals.
Speaker 1: I agree. I'm an adult and I love going to the zoo. I don't like animals experiments though. I believe that we can do tests in other ways.
Speaker 1: Were I in your position, I'd go to America.
Speaker 2: Which university should I apply to?
Speaker 1: There are many universities for you to choose from. Some famous universities such as Harvard, Yale, The University of Michigan, And Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study, But they are very competitive and expensive. Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: He seems sincere, And trustworthy.
Speaker 2: Well, He is, But he can be conniving at times.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that he would never stab me in the back. But I've seen him double cross other people.
Speaker 1: Oh, My! Really? I never thought he would be like that.
Speaker 2: Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's like that all the time.
Speaker 1: So, Can I trust him or what?
Speaker 1: At our club.
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: At 7:30 p.M.
Speaker 2: I'll go in time, Thank you.
Speaker 1: I'm so pleased that you can go.
Speaker 1: Here you are. You must return them within a month.
Speaker 2: What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month?
Speaker 1: You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them.
Speaker 2: Ok. Thank you very much for your trouble.
Speaker 1: No trouble at all. So long.
Speaker 1: You shouldn't work so hard.
Speaker 2: I know, But hard work pays off. You know.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Attractive scenery, Pleasant climate, These make it charming.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think so. But there is also something terrible.
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: Sometimes the traffic is too busy.
Speaker 2: Yes, You are right.
Speaker 1: Did you get caught in the bad storm?
Speaker 2: Yes, We got wet through. But we still enjoyed ourselves.
Speaker 1: Well. There're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city. That's half the collections of antique objects in China. There's one exhibition half for multiple collection, And several individual display rooms for private collectors.
Speaker 2: Private collectors! They must have excellent collections. I'II go and see each of them. What kinds of collections can I see? Come on, Don't keep me in suspense!
Speaker 1: No hurry! I'II tell you now, The collections include ancient cases and caskets, Tea sets, Abacuses, Precious sea shells and conches, Drama costumes, Agates, Ancient coins, Fans, Mini-musical instruments, Root-carving, Rare stones and rocks, Model ships, Model cars...
Speaker 1: Maybe you are right.
Speaker 2: Look. It's begin.
Speaker 1: Well, How did you like the show?
Speaker 2: It's so interesting, I like it very much.
Speaker 1: I'd like to. I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us. Welcome to China again.
Speaker 2: Of course, I will. Well, It's time for me to say goodbye. The plane will take off soon. Hope some day you will come to America for a visit.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I will if I have chance. Goodbye and happy landing!
Speaker 1: Relax, It was just a goat!
Speaker 2: And that?
Speaker 1: It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later.
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: Honey, Seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax! Relax, That was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.
Speaker 2: You know what? I don't think I can hack it here out in the countryside. I'm going back to the city!
Speaker 1: And what athletics did you play? Can you remember?
Speaker 2: I was a runner_a long-distance runner.
Speaker 1: And now?
Speaker 2: No. I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married.
Speaker 1: Well, Thank you again for coming to see us. But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams.
Speaker 2: Certainly, Sir.
Speaker 1: No, Not at all. It looks really classy on you. Where did you pick that up?
Speaker 2: I got it on sale down at the department store.
Speaker 1: When did you go there?
Speaker 2: I was just there a couple of days ago. You know, You should go down there too. They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale.
Speaker 1: I might just do that. What style of clothes do they have?
Speaker 2: Anything you want. They have both casual and formal styles.
Speaker 1: Yeah, At least when we are children, We have not so much homework to do.
Speaker 1: The internet's a lot worse.
Speaker 2: Really? Why?
Speaker 1: There's no one moderating it. Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see. The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it, Or why. A lot of people get conned online.
Speaker 1: He said I'd got the flu.
Speaker 2: Oh dear! What did he tell you to do?
Speaker 1: He told me to stay in bed for ten days.
Speaker 2: Ten days? Would you please repeat it again?
Speaker 1: Yes, Ten days.
Speaker 1: The trust game was your favorite, Huh? My favorite part was the personality tests. I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team. Also, When you know the personality strengths of your colleagues, It helps you understand them better.
Speaker 1: Yes, It is.
Speaker 2: Why don't we go together? I can show you around. I think you'll have a better time.
Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more.
Speaker 2: Great, Let's go!
Speaker 1: Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net?
Speaker 1: I know they're out there. I'll find them.
Speaker 2: You're such a dreamer! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass?
Speaker 1: But you did it and did it well!
Speaker 1: Wen! That's only a stereotype. Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses. I'm not a great dancer, And you said you failed calculus.
Speaker 2: Ha-ha! You got me there!
Speaker 1: Hey, I know what that's like. I bought a BMW on my Visa card. Now the payments really hurt.
Speaker 2: Well, You're lucky that you're still able to make your payments. I missed a credit payment last month. Now my bank account's overdrawn, And the company is threatening to take back my purchases.
Speaker 1: What did you buy?
Speaker 2: A new home health monitor.
Speaker 1: I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD.
Speaker 2: My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University.
Speaker 1: I really appreciate your kind words.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, Her poster, A CD...
Speaker 2: So you're a big fan, Eh?
Speaker 1: Not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion designer, Too.
Speaker 2: And she was in a movie once again, Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Though I don't think her acting skills are that great.
Speaker 2: What was your impression of her when you saw her in person?
Speaker 1: Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?
Speaker 2: Homework, Attendance, And quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each.
Speaker 1: What if we miss something?
Speaker 2: I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time.
Speaker 1: Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?
Speaker 2: You will be able to track your progress during the year.
Speaker 1: That, My Heart Will Go On. It warms my heart. You know, JanetJackson, Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different.
Speaker 2: Janet Jackson is more pop music. Shania sings country music. Celine just seems to hit all the right notes.
Speaker 1: Have you heard Maria Carey?
Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do?
Speaker 2: No... Not really. The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died. I really wanted to be there one last time.
Speaker 1: I'm sure she knew you loved her. Did she pass away in the hospital?
Speaker 2: Yeah. She died in her sleep.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry she's gone.
Speaker 2: At least she didn't suffer.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure. Let me give a call to find out.
Speaker 1: GmAT? What does that stand for and what will the test contain?
Speaker 2: Graduate Management Admission Test, It contains three parts.
Speaker 1: Okay, This sounds a little tough, How am I supposed to practice for this?
Speaker 1: How could it be? They are due two weeks later.
Speaker 2: I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days.
Speaker 1: Kate, You know, I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more. But I'm so busy! How am I going to work and study.
Speaker 2: To be honest with you, Jason, I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job. I'm always two steps behind. I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha.
Speaker 1: My advisor?
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: Like for example, If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.
Speaker 1: I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.
Speaker 2: You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!
Speaker 1: Well, I have no regrets!
Speaker 1: How about a comedy?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful.
Speaker 1: How about a love story then?
Speaker 2: No, Romance is boring.
Speaker 1: What's you opinion?
Speaker 2: Let's go to see a war movie, Shall we?
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 1: ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh, Dear me! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend. So we have to go to cinema instead.
Speaker 2: What's on?
Speaker 1: Let me see .. um. Gone With the Wind. It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night.
Speaker 2: That sounds interesting. Which is the nearest?
Speaker 1: Ah. The Royal, I think.
Speaker 1: Thanks so much. I owe you one.
Speaker 1: It is too loud, We'll handle some official business first before the dinner.
Speaker 2: Oh, I nearly forget it.
Speaker 1: You can put on your white shoes, It fits every occasion.
Speaker 1: What do you mean? We're talking now, Aren't we?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes, But we used to do so much together.
Speaker 1: Yes. I remember. But we never used to argue. You used to think I was wonderful. Where are you going?
Speaker 2: Back to live with my parents. That's something else I used to do before we were married. Remember?
Speaker 1: It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten.
Speaker 2: Well. I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam.
Speaker 1: Why are you so pessimistic?
Speaker 2: I'm not being pessimistic. I'm being realistic. My chemistry is so bad.
Speaker 1: I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation. Don't lose your heart.
Speaker 2: Thank you. That's very nice of you.
Speaker 1: Which school?
Speaker 2: I transferred from PCC.
Speaker 1: How do you like it here compared to PCC?
Speaker 2: I love it here.
Speaker 1: Do you like it better here or at PCC?
Speaker 2: Don't get me wrong. I like it here, But PCC is better.
Speaker 1: So, Why did you leave PCC?
Speaker 2: Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree.
Speaker 1: It's true. Guess what we were talking about last night.
Speaker 2: Her new boyfriend, Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, How do you know about that?
Speaker 2: I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing.
Speaker 2: I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex.
Speaker 1: Oh, How did you deal with it?
Speaker 2: I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's a pity. What was the matter?
Speaker 2: Simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.
Speaker 1: I drink a lot of wine.
Speaker 2: If I were you, I wouldn't drink too much.
Speaker 1: I often feel so tired.
Speaker 2: You better do some exercise every morning.
Speaker 1: I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me.
Speaker 2: Why do you worry about your future? You're very young, And you'll make great contribution to the world. I hope you take my advice.
Speaker 1: Come on. She's like that with everyone.
Speaker 2: I don't think so actually. She never even says \"hello\" to me.
Speaker 1: Because this is a public place, And I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage.
Speaker 2: Listen, I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue. It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space. It's not like there's garbage everywhere. Besides, Someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another.
Speaker 1: It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people. It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people. If everyone thought like you, There'd be garbage everywhere! The cleaners can't be everywhere!
Speaker 2: Ok, Whatever. See, I'm putting it in the garbage can.
Speaker 1: I actually try to avoid name-brand items. I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place!
Speaker 2: I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money, I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds.
Speaker 1: I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time, But I don't think it always makes sense.
Speaker 1: But they are showing what will be all the rage next year.
Speaker 2: All the rage with whom? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street.
Speaker 1: Did you know that fashion is cyclical?
Speaker 2: What, It keeps coming back?
Speaker 1: Precisely! For example, Flares were popular for a while, Then went out of fashion. Now we can start to see them coming back in again.
Speaker 2: Flares?
Speaker 1: Don't be silly. We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Really? I had no idea. Let me check. Yes, It's dead. There's no dial tone.
Speaker 2: So I couldn't get through. I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start. It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater. That's why I'm late.
Speaker 1: But this is terrible. I'm expecting important calls.
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: You know what. The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play. They are supposed to call me this evening. If I don't have a phone. Oh, What can I do?
Speaker 1: It's the Powell orchestra.
Speaker 2: Do you know what they are playing?
Speaker 1: They're doing a seventeenth-century program.
Speaker 2: And who is directing?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not sure of his name, But I know it's going to be his farewell performance.
Speaker 1: No, I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: When you cross the quad, The office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line.
Speaker 1: Thanks. I understand what to do now.
Speaker 2: It should be easy to find. After you add the class, Check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet.
Speaker 1: That sounds good.
Speaker 1: Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available, She can come too?
Speaker 2: Won't he be surprised!
Speaker 1: I don't know how old he is though.
Speaker 2: That's O. K. Maybe his wife will spill the beans!
Speaker 1: I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects, Especially the singing of cicadas.
Speaker 1: Who was chairing the meeting?
Speaker 2: Bob.
Speaker 1: Well, I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes.
Speaker 2: That's exactly what happened! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say. Then he expected everyone to agree with him.
Speaker 1: What was the meeting about?
Speaker 2: We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient.
Speaker 1: My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening.
Speaker 2: What time does it begin?
Speaker 1: At eight thirty.
Speaker 2: I'll come for you at about eight.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'll be waiting.
Speaker 1: That's one reason I'd like to try it. I'd really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office.
Speaker 2: You'd need a lot of training before becoming a farmer. It's not something you can just walk into.
Speaker 1: My uncle owns a farm and I'Ve spent some time working with him. I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields.
Speaker 2: Well, I ‘d certainly come and visit you. It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm. I'd love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while.
Speaker 1: Have you turned it on?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have.
Speaker 1: Ok, I will get you another one.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: No, Not yet. But Susan says they'd like to get married in November or December. Then they'll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon.
Speaker 1: Why? If I eat less, Then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, Right?
Speaker 2: Not really. You should try to not eat foods high in calories, Salts or saturated fats. Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.
Speaker 1: So you are saying that I should eat, But I should just watch what I eat?
Speaker 1: Elvis Presley. Don't you recognize his voice?
Speaker 2: No. How about going to karaoke tonight?
Speaker 1: Good idea.
Speaker 1: What's he doing?
Speaker 2: He is an accountant. I have been helping him for a week.
Speaker 1: He must be happy.
Speaker 2: Yeah. How are you these days?
Speaker 1: Fine too.
Speaker 1: Not really. I just worked on my car all day.
Speaker 2: That old thing! Why don't you just buy a new one?
Speaker 1: But then what would I do every weekend?
Speaker 1: Thank you for wonderful meat.
Speaker 2: I'm glad you enjoy it.
Speaker 1: That's not the gadgets. Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts.
Speaker 1: Hey, Thanks, Mum.
Speaker 1: My husband is betting on France.
Speaker 2: France? Is he crazy?
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, How do I put this? France is a terrible team.
Speaker 1: Ah, Yes. I remember now. Were you Mr. John's dinner partner last month?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was. You work for 3M, Right?
Speaker 1: I did but now I'm for Microsoft. How are things with you?
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: May I know what you do?
Speaker 2: I'm a fashion designer. Next month, I have a fashion show. I'd love it if come. I can get you a couple of tickets. So you can bring a friend if you like.
Speaker 1: Sure. That would be great. Good luck.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: It's 10 centimeters, So the circumference should be 31. 4 centimeters.
Speaker 2: Ok. My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars. What's the exchange rate at the moment?
Speaker 1: According to the newspaper, The exchange rate is 1. 85 dollars to the pound.
Speaker 2: That means that 10. 000 pounds will buy me 18. 500 dollars.
Speaker 1: What's the next question.
Speaker 1: No regrets?
Speaker 2: I'm really pleased with it. Thanks.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you're so happy.
Speaker 2: It's super.
Speaker 1: At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill, But other than that, Tipping isn't customary.
Speaker 2: What about cab drivers and porters?
Speaker 1: It's certainly a popular hobby. I know a lot of people love stamps.
Speaker 2: It certainly is. It's so much fun.
Speaker 1: I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world.
Speaker 1: Well, Every stamp has a story to tell.
Speaker 2: You're right. And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps.
Speaker 1: No, Thank you. It looks a bit too dangerous for me.
Speaker 2: There is a beautiful state park here. I can see why so many people come out here to camp.
Speaker 1: Yes, There is this beautiful view. You may go fishing, Camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air.
Speaker 2: It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city.
Speaker 1: You are so romantic, My sweetheart.
Speaker 1: Oh, Is that all?
Speaker 2: I feel very nervous about it.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. Try to look on the bright sight of things.
Speaker 1: So, What's the problem?
Speaker 2: I drew a blank on ~ about the test.
Speaker 1: No kidding! Didn't you study for it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, But nothing was clear during the test.
Speaker 1: That's too bad, Anyway, I'm sure things will turn around next master.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking of dropping out.
Speaker 1: You can't do that, Jenny!
Speaker 2: I'm dead serious about this, Sally.
Speaker 1: Come on, Let's talk about it.
Speaker 1: No joke! That's why she hasn't married yet.
Speaker 1: I don't think she will do such a thing.
Speaker 2: But she did and made me disappointed.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up. A girlfriend is not everything.
Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.
Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.
Speaker 2: Oh. I just can't forget it.
Speaker 1: Good idea, Betty. What would you think about the second part?
Speaker 2: I think it's too short. You'd better say something about your work experience.
Speaker 1: You're right, I'll change it. How about the last part?
Speaker 2: Very good. But you should talk about your family, Too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, We would have been lost without the help of the locals.
Speaker 2: Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street?
Speaker 1: Of course. That was the best pasta I've ever had.
Speaker 2: I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day.
Speaker 1: If only we could eat there once more!
Speaker 1: Yes, But I doubt if I get it. I've never get it.
Speaker 2: Better luck this time.
Speaker 1: There's a possibility. What do you say?
Speaker 2: That's not a bad idea. Bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee.
Speaker 1: What are spring and autumn like?
Speaker 2: I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, The weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, Sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny an.
Speaker 1: Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, So our summertime is your wintertime, And vice versa. We get some rain in every season, But most is in winter. In winter, It sometimes gets cold, But our wine.
Speaker 2: Do you usually go on a summer holiday?
Speaker 1: I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this. Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you. All you have to do it get on the train tonight a.
Speaker 2: The train? Will I be flying back then?
Speaker 1: Oh, No. We've brought your return ticket for you. I think you'll find it comfortable.
Speaker 2: Will the train be very crowded?
Speaker 1: I have been looking forward to this performance all month.
Speaker 2: I'm really sorry I let you down. I'll make it up to you somehow.
Speaker 1: I guess you are right. But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.
Speaker 2: I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.
Speaker 2: Sounds great to me! If they are willing, We could ask them to go dancing with us. That is excellent exercise and fun, Too.
Speaker 1: Really? What about the pay rate? Are the wages pretty high?
Speaker 2: From what I hear, They are very reasonable. A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives.
Speaker 1: That's why many people died in the earthquake.
Speaker 2: Well, China is located on the Eurasia plate, Where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other.
Speaker 1: Oh, China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, We've experienced the 8. 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman.
Speaker 1: We're all familiar with natural disasters. But we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake.
Speaker 1: Are you going swimming again this afternoon?
Speaker 2: No, We aren't. We're going to help Mr Smith to plant some flowers.
Speaker 1: Are you helping him all afternoon?
Speaker 2: Yes, We are. We can neither play football nor do our homework today.
Speaker 1: You're, Going to be very busy.
Speaker 2: Yes, We certainly are. But Mr Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do.
Speaker 1: About four years now.
Speaker 2: Well, It is very beautiful.
Speaker 1: Ron, Have a seat and I'll get us something to drink.
Speaker 2: Good! I am really thirsty. You know it really is hot outside!
Speaker 1: I have lemonade,iced tea, And mango juice.
Speaker 2: Mango juice would be perfect. Thank you!
Speaker 1: No coal has been discovered in my country, But there may be undiscovered deposits. We don't have many metal deposits.
Speaker 2: There are a few in my country. We have deposit of gold, But they are very small.
Speaker 1: When I traveled around your country, I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country. The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country. The gold was found in mountain steams.
Speaker 1: Really? What is it?
Speaker 2: I have an offer to work for a company in your city today?
Speaker 1: I can't believe it! Is it real? You're moving here?
Speaker 2: I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding. If you have time I think we c.
Speaker 1: Just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free. You know after all these chatting online, It will be great to meet you in real life. I look forward to seeing you soon!
Speaker 2: Me too. But I think I am going to bed now. My head is getting heavy. Have a nice day there!
Speaker 1: Wow. You're really a heavy smoker.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not. My father smoked two packs a day for forty years.
Speaker 1: He died of lung cancer, Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah... You're right. I really should stop smoking.
Speaker 1: Nandu. Nandu, How do you spell you name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, My name is like N-A-N-J-U.
Speaker 1: Oh, Ok. That's a nice name, Nandu. And where are you from?
Speaker 2: I'm from Madras.
Speaker 1: I've got it all covered.
Speaker 2: If you miss this class, You will have used up your quota for the semester.
Speaker 1: Don't worry, This will be the last class I miss.
Speaker 2: Make sure to remind me right before you are absent.
Speaker 1: I'll remember.
Speaker 2: Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study!
Speaker 1: You are right. What about shoes?
Speaker 2: The brown leather shoes are OK.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 2: Don't mention it.
Speaker 1: That's good. Maybe you'll get promoted.
Speaker 2: I hope so.
Speaker 1: Well, Direct ones are the pollution directly from factories, Refineries waste treatment plants etc., Aren't they?
Speaker 2: Yeah. They are emitted directly into urban water supplies.
Speaker 1: But what about the indirect ones?
Speaker 1: Good-bye. Hope to see you soon again next year.
Speaker 2: Don't forget to call us if you're in Tokyo.
Speaker 1: It's surely worth going to. There are ten famous spots there.
Speaker 2: What can we do next after locating the place?
Speaker 1: Inform my members to prepare for the travelling. And then we can discuss about the travelling costs.
Speaker 1: I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February. Yeah, Depending on when my brother can come in.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's a gay bar.
Speaker 1: Yes, It is. Conrad is gay. Didn't you know?
Speaker 2: I thought he was maybe gay, But I wasn't sure. Anyhow, You don't expect me to go into a gay bar, Do you?
Speaker 1: Why not? We're supposed to meet him there.
Speaker 2: Why doesn't he meet us outside?
Speaker 1: Why should he do that? It isn't illegal for us to go in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, But who wants to go in? I'm not gay, You know. Why should I go in a gay bar?
Speaker 1: Well, Hang in there. In twenty years, You'll fell it was well worth it!
Speaker 1: Great! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.
Speaker 2: This is gonna be a great barbecue!
Speaker 1: Well, The weather is so unpredictable this time of year.
Speaker 2: You're right. We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Look! It looks as if it is going to rain.
Speaker 2: The weatherman predicts a fine day today.
Speaker 1: The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast.
Speaker 1: I see. Has she read any detective stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes!
Speaker 1: Do you know if she's read this one?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, But she probably won't remember if she has! She's very forgetful!
Speaker 1: Ah! She has a bad memory. How old is she?
Speaker 2: She's eighty-seven.
Speaker 1: I suggest you take this book. It's very exciting.
Speaker 1: My parents live by themselves now. When they get older, They'll probably go to a retirement home. Do you just have one brother?
Speaker 2: No, I have two older brothers and one younger sister. What about you?
Speaker 1: I also grew up in a big family. I have one older brother and three younger sisters.
Speaker 1: Don't forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts.
Speaker 2: Can you ride a horse?
Speaker 1: There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.
Speaker 2: I see! Do you want to ask her out?
Speaker 1: Sure, But how?
Speaker 2: You can ask her out for drink after work.
Speaker 1: But for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.
Speaker 2: Then you've got a lot of homework to do. You need to get her notice first.
Speaker 1: Easier said than done.
Speaker 2: You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her.
Speaker 1: How about summer?
Speaker 2: I dislike it most.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because the hottest season is summer in a year.
Speaker 1: But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.
Speaker 1: Oh, Did you get a job?
Speaker 2: Yes, I got a job as a Management Trainee.
Speaker 1: Fantastic.
Speaker 1: How silly John is.
Speaker 1: Do you ever get lonely living alone?
Speaker 2: Not at all. I see you and your family twice a week, And I enjoy seeing my own friends. I'm too busy to feel lonely!
Speaker 1: Do you believe her excuse?
Speaker 2: Of course not. I knew she had fallen in love with another guy. It is difficult to see her move on so quickly.
Speaker 1: Come on, Buddy, Cheer up. Why not do some sports with me? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Steven. You are really a good friend.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter. No one will laugh at you.
Speaker 2: Ok, I'Il go with you. When shall we go?
Speaker 1: What about six?
Speaker 2: It's too early. Let's make it seven, Ok?
Speaker 1: Ok. Let's make it.
Speaker 1: Is that right? Like what kind of changes?
Speaker 2: You'll see. Oh, Yeah, You'll see.
Speaker 1: Come on, Grow up. Have you seen Vince around?
Speaker 1: Oh, How wonderful. I'll be glad to.
Speaker 2: Okay, Now you are a famous star.
Speaker 1: Hum, Don't say that. Maybe you can do something useful for me.
Speaker 2: What's wrong with you?
Speaker 1: I'll tell you at the party.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sense and Sensibility, English version.
Speaker 2: Yes, Of course.
Speaker 1: Can I just do it here?
Speaker 2: Sorry. No. You should go to the other counter.
Speaker 1: Ok, Thanks.
Speaker 2: Sorry, This biography is over the deadline. You should pay extra for it.
Speaker 1: I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library... Anyway, How much should I pay?
Speaker 2: 3 Yuan, Please.
Speaker 1: Here you are. Thanks.
Speaker 1: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Speaker 1: Whatever you prefer.
Speaker 2: This is a very nice place. How long have you been living here now?
Speaker 1: Just over three weeks. Would you like a drink?
Speaker 2: Sure, What do you have?
Speaker 1: I've got white wine, Red wine, Gin and tonics, Ginger ale, Lemonade, Orange juice, And sprite.
Speaker 2: I'll have a glass of red wine please.
Speaker 1: One glass of red wine coming up!
Speaker 1: What a heavy snow!
Speaker 2: Take care! Don't slip down to the ground.
Speaker 1: I've got it. I like the sound of stepping on the snow very much.
Speaker 2: Yes. Very wonderful.
Speaker 1: Do you smell the sweet scent?
Speaker 2: Yes. It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms.
Speaker 1: The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness.
Speaker 1: Just a few Christmas gifts,'tis the season, After all!
Speaker 2: Don't take that tone with me. Do you have an invoice for these items?
Speaker 1: Umm... No... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole!
Speaker 2: You are under arrest, Sir. You have the right to remain silent. You better not pout, You better not cry. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, The state will appoint one for you. Do you understand the arrest to you?
Speaker 1: Well, Tell him to take it easy and that I hope he feels better.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I'll tell him.
Speaker 1: I am not sure where the bookstore is.
Speaker 2: When you pass the gym, It'll be the first door on the left. Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money?
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew I could do that. Exactly how do I go about selling them?
Speaker 2: If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door, He will reimburse you. Can you go over there today?
Speaker 1: I think maybe I could be there.
Speaker 1: True. How much did you pay?
Speaker 2: $ 14, 500. It only has 10, 000 miles on it, So it's like a new car.
Speaker 1: Does that mean you're not going to take the train to work anymore?
Speaker 2: Well, Sometimes, I think it'll be nice to drive to work instead. We'll see. Want to go for a ride?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sure.
Speaker 2: Come on.
Speaker 1: I know a good place to hire bikes if you want.
Speaker 2: Thanks. That would be really helpful.
Speaker 1: But remember, Be careful when you ride a bike. The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous.
Speaker 1: Maybe. I'll have to ask my mother.
Speaker 1: Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.
Speaker 2: I know, But geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field.
Speaker 1: Well, If you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.
Speaker 2: Oh, Thanks, Professor Donald. This is very nice of you.
Speaker 1: Nothing special.
Speaker 2: I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week?
Speaker 1: Sounds good. Sorry, Here comes my bus. You call me, Or I'll call you to make a date.
Speaker 2: I'll call you.
Speaker 1: All right. Gotta go, Bye, Keep in touch.
Speaker 2: Have a great day, Take care, Bye.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. It is a test of physical endurance, Intelligence. Just to finish it is considered a victory for most.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll talk to you later.
Speaker 1: I do wish I could lose weight.
Speaker 2: Well, Why don't you go on the diet?
Speaker 1: I've tried diets before but they've never worked.
Speaker 2: Perhaps you should excercise more. Why don't you go to an exercise class.
Speaker 1: Yes, Maybe I should.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never thought we could be good friends either. We have our differences. She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed, But we still get along extremely well. We can talk for hours about anything.
Speaker 2: That's great. I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes.
Speaker 1: When Jo and I are together, We argue a lot, But that's also part of the fun. Besides, I know she will always be there for me when I need her, And she knows I'll be there for her.
Speaker 1: Your bag? Did you get it back?
Speaker 2: I went back for it. But it was already gone.
Speaker 1: That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 1: No, I haven't got any plans.
Speaker 2: Shall we go out tomorrow then?
Speaker 1: Why not? Sounds good to me.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.
Speaker 1: Is that so?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Take my word for it.
Speaker 1: You'd better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September...
Speaker 2: Well, Actually, I am thinking about living off campus.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea how much that would cost?
Speaker 2: I know it would be more expensive. I think I could handle it though. It's that this dorm is so noisy that I can't get anything done.
Speaker 1: You should study in the library the way I do. Think of the money you'd save.
Speaker 1: It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place.
Speaker 2: That's great. Let's go!
Speaker 1: Yeah. I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today.
Speaker 2: I have one. We could share it. Which way are you going?
Speaker 1: Oh, That's very kind of you. I am going to the Garden Hotel.
Speaker 2: I am going there, Too. We can walk together.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 1: Good!
Speaker 2: What time should I arrive?
Speaker 1: How about 6:00?
Speaker 2: Fine. See you then.
Speaker 1: Good. So we don't have to work. How nice!
Speaker 2: But I don't think it's so nice.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain.
Speaker 1: What else can you speak?
Speaker 2: Well, I know a little Italian.
Speaker 1: I know how goals are scored in football, But how about in rugby?
Speaker 2: If a team carries the ball over the goal line, They score points. A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch.
Speaker 1: What time shall we go?
Speaker 2: Why not now? I'm hungry.
Speaker 1: Really? Tell me more.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not one to gossip, As you know, But rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment.
Speaker 1: Wow, Crikey. So what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, This is just between ourselves, Of course, But he was her lover and he wanted to leave her, So she got revenge. I heard him say she was a dangerous woman.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Oh, While we're on the subject, What happened to you and your secretary?
Speaker 1: But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week.
Speaker 2: Box office can't explain everything. I do not think it is cheerful or well-made. The plot is old and the female character is not pretty.
Speaker 1: My sister has given me two tickets for tonight. It is called 'The life of Rose', A French movie.
Speaker 2: What's it about?
Speaker 1: It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world. It is a kind of tragedy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to decorate my house.
Speaker 2: Really, That's cool. Let me see what you'Ve done.
Speaker 1: But actually it's not done yet. I'm going to get a special pendent lamp.
Speaker 2: That's all right. Let me see, Oh, That lace looks so unique, And it's so creative to make a picture display here. How did you get that idea?
Speaker 1: It's just a simple decorating. I just want to add my personality to my living space.
Speaker 1: How about the words of the song?
Speaker 2: It sounds nice.
Speaker 1: I like it. Naturally it can arouse your feelings.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. It's very emotional.
Speaker 1: Of course, And I also like the rhythms.
Speaker 2: Full of energy and hope.
Speaker 1: Really. It's worth listening to and enjoying.
Speaker 2: Certainly it is. It's worth an Academy Award.
Speaker 1: Sorry, Nope. But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight.
Speaker 2: That's a black fraternity, Right? So we should see some dancing!
Speaker 1: Is a family like yours common in South Korea?
Speaker 2: No. Not anymore. Mine is highly educated but traditional family. Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller. In traditional families, The old people are well respected and taken good care of. Ho.
Speaker 1: My family setup is a bit different. In New York city, There're only three people, My mother, My stepfather and me. During this summertime, I fly out to California and live with my dad. Dad's getting.
Speaker 1: No, I listened to the music, Too.
Speaker 2: What are you going to do now?
Speaker 1: I'm tired. I need a rest.
Speaker 1: If there's ever anything I can do for you, Don't hesitate to let me know.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: I'm most grateful.
Speaker 2: It was a pleasure.
Speaker 1: I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, How can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?
Speaker 2: You'Ve got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?
Speaker 1: Look, We have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, It's probably not a good idea to keep it up I'm willing to forgive and forget and if you are.
Speaker 2: Fine. Let's call a truce. I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down.
Speaker 1: So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate?
Speaker 2: Sure, They can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, There's nothing wrong with having a small desert.
Speaker 1: How about drinking soda?
Speaker 1: I am glad you can study something you really like!
Speaker 1: Then, When do you plan to get married?
Speaker 2: I don't know. It's still up in the air.
Speaker 1: I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior.
Speaker 2: Don't pretend you are a good God.
Speaker 1: You should feel shameful for your behavior.
Speaker 2: I've never experienced such a kind of feeling.
Speaker 1: I'm really sick of you.
Speaker 1: Well, I have a lot of work. I'll see how it goes.
Speaker 1: If you can't give me the full amount, A fraction of it would still help. I'll pay you back on Monday. I promise.
Speaker 2: Let's see, I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend. I can only spare about $ 20. I would give you more if I had it, I just don't have much money to my name right now.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot Ayden. Every little bit will help. Tell you what, If you aren't doing anything tonight, Why don't you come over and have dinner at my place.
Speaker 1: No, It's not. Not at all. I'd probably freeze my lungs.
Speaker 2: Wait for me a minute. I'll go over to the gym too.
Speaker 1: You?
Speaker 2: Yes, Why not? Just let me get my gym clothes together.
Speaker 1: I didn't know you could exercise.
Speaker 2: What do you mean by that? Everyone can exercise!
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know. But you? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth.
Speaker 1: No way! Do you have a flavors you don't like?
Speaker 2: I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it.
Speaker 1: I agree with that, It just doesn't work for me.
Speaker 2: I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once.
Speaker 1: I think that would be horrible!
Speaker 2: I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!
Speaker 1: I wish I could play a musical instrument. I love music.
Speaker 2: Nowadays, You can be a DJ. You can mix dance music. You don't need to be able to play musical instrument or sing.
Speaker 1: I'd love to try it. But the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice.
Speaker 2: You know, You could probably get a computer program that would help you. You already have a computer, So you could use that to help you mix some music.
Speaker 1: And look out she's dressed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I noticed. She must be really loaded.
Speaker 2: Well, That's my opinion.
Speaker 1: At least we agree on that. Let's go and get a drink.
Speaker 1: Do they have any grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yes, They have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys.
Speaker 1: Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws?
Speaker 2: Yes, She gets along with them quite well.
Speaker 1: Do they have a large family?
Speaker 2: Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron's family.
Speaker 1: Never believe his words.
Speaker 1: . I have a house in the suburbs.
Speaker 2: Oh, I bet it's really quiet. But is there much to do there?
Speaker 1: No, Not much. In fact, Nothing ever really happens. That's the trouble.
Speaker 2: Hey. Let's trade places one weekend!
Speaker 1: Ok. Great idea!
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: Well, To be honest, Nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss.
Speaker 2: I understand. The last time I went on a business trip with the boss, I didn't even have enough to eat!
Speaker 1: I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses. I spent half of the weekend on a train! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets!
Speaker 2: Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes.
Speaker 1: I see. Well, Then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip. It was reallytiring for me.
Speaker 1: Just a minute please. Oh, I'm sorry, All the tickets for tonight have been sold out.
Speaker 2: What a pity! How about tomorrow evening?
Speaker 1: Oh, You're lucky, There are just two tickets left. Do you want to take them?
Speaker 2: Wonderful, I'll take them.
Speaker 1: Ok, Your name and telephone number please.
Speaker 2: Wang Min. Telephone number is 13811658. Can I pick the tickets this afternoon?
Speaker 1: Yes, Of course.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Everyone in our class enjoyed it too. It's very interesting.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm glad.
Speaker 1: Would you mind me keeping it for another three days?
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: Don't, Don't, Don't, Don't say that. That, That makes it worse.
Speaker 2: What? You don't love me? Me, Either.
Speaker 1: You don't love me?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But we're so right for each other.
Speaker 2: I know, I know. Well, Is there some, Is there someone else? Oh, That woman on television, Sydney Ann.
Speaker 1: We need to set the table for four.
Speaker 2: So that's four plates, Four forks, Four knives, And four spoons?
Speaker 1: That's right. Mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you.
Speaker 2: Don't be silly! I know how to use knives and forks.
Speaker 1: What did the critic say?
Speaker 2: He didn't say it was bad, But he said that it wasn't as good as it could have been, Particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it.
Speaker 1: The movie starts at eight o 'clock, So we have plenty of time to eat and get ready.
Speaker 2: Good. Dinner is nearly ready and I'd like to watch the news before we go. The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results.
Speaker 1: I usually play chess with my friends. But I like playing basketball best.
Speaker 2: Do you play basketball well?
Speaker 1: No, I'm not very good at it. I play just for the fun of it.
Speaker 2: Shall we have a game together some day?
Speaker 1: Ok, That'd be very nice.
Speaker 1: If you like, I'll take you to a new restaurant next time, I just heard about it from my friend, And he was just raving about it. It's such a greatSichuan cuisine. Would you like to try that?
Speaker 2: Sure, I'd love to. I heardSichuan cuisine is very hot, I think I definitely love it.
Speaker 1: Great, I love hot food too.
Speaker 1: My first time. I've traveled around Europe a lot, But this was my first time to Spain. It was amazing, And the weather was just beautiful! No rain, And just sun, Sun, Sun...
Speaker 2: I'm so jealous of you. I've never been anywhere in Europe. I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.
Speaker 1: Well, I really recommend Spain. You really should go. Anyway, It's been great to catch up, But I must be going, This is my floor. Speak again soon I hope.
Speaker 1: Look at that cylindrical office building. I'Ve never been seen one that shape before.
Speaker 2: Yes. Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape.
Speaker 1: Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top. They're not perfectly cylindrical.
Speaker 1: Wow, You're really informative. Thanks a lot.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Oh, No, Get off it. It wasn't such a killer class. You just have to get into it. Like they say, No pain, No gain.
Speaker 2: I am wiped out. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Look, Next time get yourself some comfy shoes. You're gonna come back again with me, Aren't you?
Speaker 2: Never! But thank you for inviting me.
Speaker 1: Your garden is really lovely.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Do you take care of them everyday?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Don't you feel dull?
Speaker 2: I don't. I like the work.
Speaker 1: What about your mother? Did she help you?
Speaker 2: Yes, She did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can't depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That's it. I had to care for them most of the time.
Speaker 1: I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don't know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day.
Speaker 1: Did your teacher tell you the route he took?
Speaker 2: Yeah, He, With his fleet, Came across the Indian Ocean, And arrived at the east coast of Africa.
Speaker 1: Great, Do you still remember when he started his voyage?
Speaker 2: Of course, That is from 1405 to 1433, Which is in Ming dynasty.
Speaker 1: Good, By the way, Do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you?
Speaker 1: And how about your Spanish?
Speaker 2: Well, It's not as good as my French. I can speak it reasonably well, But my written Spanish isn't very good.
Speaker 1: I see. Well, We have a lot of Spanish customers, But you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here.
Speaker 2: In that case, I'm fit for the position I think.
Speaker 1: He lets his cousins look after his business.
Speaker 2: He sounds more like an artist than a businessman.
Speaker 1: I feel much better now.
Speaker 2: Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday?
Speaker 1: I'Ve already got it. Thanks.
Speaker 2: I will explain it in detail in the next class. Could you preview it?
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 1: Cool! Is it safe for us to eat there though?
Speaker 2: Sure. In fact, Nowadays, You'll see more tourists there than Italians. There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat.
Speaker 1: Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?
Speaker 2: No, But I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home!
Speaker 1: What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her?
Speaker 2: I wanted to, But I knew that if I spoke to her, I'd just blow up at her, So I decided to just go home. I called her later that the night, But she didn't answer the phone.
Speaker 1: Oh, Photography, It's really a good hobby.
Speaker 2: Yes, I usually develop and print all my own photos.
Speaker 1: You yourself have a photo studio?
Speaker 2: Yes, Simple as it is. It does work.
Speaker 1: Terrific. There is one girl said, It is the best game I've ever watched.
Speaker 2: Who do you think do better?
Speaker 1: Clive was really outstanding. Not only he put on a big show himself, But also he inspired the whole team.
Speaker 2: Exactly. He is unbelievable.
Speaker 1: On the other hand, I think the other team won everyone's respect. The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning, But they just carried on and never lost their cool.
Speaker 2: They were really tough.
Speaker 1: Give me a short haircut.
Speaker 2: Do you know how short you want your hair to be?
Speaker 1: I want you to cut it to a few inches long.
Speaker 2: That's pretty short. Are you sure about this?
Speaker 1: I've had this idea for some time now.
Speaker 2: I'm going to do it, But you have to be sure you really want me to.
Speaker 1: This is what I want.
Speaker 2: Fine then. Let's get started.
Speaker 1: Yes, I will move on to XYZ Company.
Speaker 2: Good for you, But your leaving will be a great loss to us. It is so nice to work with you.
Speaker 1: Thanks. I had learned so much from you and our colleagues.
Speaker 1: Oh, I haven't noticed that before. Maybe I will try next time.
Speaker 2: Why don't you go ahead of me? I have more items than you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. In fact, I am in a hurry. My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot.
Speaker 2: You're welcome. It was good seeing you again.
Speaker 1: Me too. Have a great day.
Speaker 1: Why do they go there?
Speaker 2: Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life. Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith.
Speaker 1: When muslims pray, They face towards mecca.
Speaker 2: That's right. Unfortunately, So many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed.
Speaker 1: I heard about that. The pilgrims must walk around a large, Sacred black stone.
Speaker 1: Do you feel your English is good enough for the course?
Speaker 2: Yes. You know, English is my present working language. Besides, I scored very high in TOEFL.
Speaker 1: Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States?
Speaker 2: I will support myself. In recent years, I have saved enough money for my study in the U.S.
Speaker 1: This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five.
Speaker 2: It's already half past four. We should go and pay our respects. Taylor's family will be there.
Speaker 2: No! I have been expecting this moment for a long time. I mean my answer is 'yes'.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm so happy. I will try my best to love you and protect you. I promise.
Speaker 2: I trust you. We'll be happy.
Speaker 1: Let me wear you this diamond ring.
Speaker 2: It's so beautiful.
Speaker 1: You fiend. It's about the flavor, Not the fix. Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines?
Speaker 1: Christmas has more religious nature, While our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday. On the New Year's Eve, We have a big dinner called 'FamilyReunion Dinner'. One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner isdumplings. After that, The adults usually sit chatting, Watching TV, Or playing cards.
Speaker 2: What are the children doing?
Speaker 1: Then would you like to have lunch with us?
Speaker 2: I'd love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now.
Speaker 1: Would you like me to give you a lift?
Speaker 2: No, Thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there.
Speaker 1: Come on. It's no trouble at all.
Speaker 2: Ok, Thank you.
Speaker 1: It wasn't cold out this morning.
Speaker 2: Well, It's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there!
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then, As well.
Speaker 2: Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you?
Speaker 1: It does, Actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.
Speaker 1: So, The national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership.
Speaker 2: Sure. There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams, And those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules.
Speaker 1: No, Not at all.
Speaker 2: First of all, It's a romance novel, Set in the early 19th century.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize it was a romance novel. What's the main storyline?
Speaker 2: It's basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls.
Speaker 1: Why does he want to do that?
Speaker 2: Since he doesn't have a son, He hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man. That way, All of his daughters will be cared for.
Speaker 1: I know what you mean.
Speaker 2: How about you? When are you leaving for Berkeley?
Speaker 1: I am leaving in two weeks.
Speaker 2: So soon! Well, I'd really like to see you again before you leave. Would you like to go out with me on Friday? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards.
Speaker 1: Oh, I am sorry, Jason. I've already got plans for Friday evening. How about Saturday?
Speaker 2: Saturday is fine. I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o 'clock. Is that ok?
Speaker 1: I like that. Then the adults will be more free tomingle and relax.
Speaker 2: That's what I was thinking.
Speaker 1: I'm so excited. Finally, A yard of my own.
Speaker 2: Do you feel like a king in your castle?
Speaker 1: Ar! Dad, The power went out.
Speaker 1: Hey, Do you know any mystery belief serve the festival?
Speaker 2: Such as...
Speaker 1: You know why fire crackers are set off in festival.
Speaker 2: Why? To welcome the new year of course.
Speaker 1: And also to frighten away evil spirits.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year.
Speaker 1: No, I thought I'd wait until you got home.
Speaker 2: Go on, Read it out loud.
Speaker 1: Ok. It says, \"Dear Jessica. It was so good to receive you letter. I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease...\".
Speaker 2: When did you send her a letter?
Speaker 1: Just a few weeks ago. Sue and I send letters to each other often.
Speaker 2: I didn't know anyone did that any more. Ok, Go on.
Speaker 1: Ok... I'm going to have to skip over this section. It's girl-talk.
Speaker 1: Who do you think will be elected?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say. They all had an active campaign to round up the votes.
Speaker 1: I think Mr. White would be elected, You know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech.
Speaker 2: Maybe. Who knows?
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck. Have you seen him?
Speaker 2: No, But someone said he was in the men's room puking. Follow me!
Speaker 1: Oh, You look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'm on a diet, But I'Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I'Ve lost twelve pounds.
Speaker 1: Wow! That's great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, But it's difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, Old habits are hard to break.
Speaker 2: What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I'm taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday.
Speaker 1: Really? It is a weekly, Isn't it?
Speaker 2: No, It's a semimonthly.
Speaker 1: Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation?
Speaker 2: Yes, It's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores.
Speaker 1: Oh, I think I should try to read one.
Speaker 1: Yes, I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not working on the weekend, So we could grab some beer, Ice and our fishing rods, And head out to the river.
Speaker 1: That sounds good. I've missed you my friend.
Speaker 2: Same here.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't think of that. Well, This reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China. Plenty of food and drink, Music and dancing, And interesting traditions.
Speaker 2: Wait until you see what happens next! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet. Let's go over and watch.
Speaker 1: Yeah, You're right. Can't go wrong with that.
Speaker 1: It is not an easy job. The government is working on it. Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital. Also, Methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought. But of course, It will not work overnight. So, Have you come out with a new plan for today?
Speaker 1: Great! Work is really busy now, But it's fun.
Speaker 1: Take it easy, Maybe tomorrow will be different.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I can't stand my job these days.
Speaker 1: Cheer up, I hope you'll feel better soon.
Speaker 1: Good idea. That might help.
Speaker 1: Really, I went to Munich last week.
Speaker 2: And did you like it?
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes. It is a fantastic city. And I like German food as well.
Speaker 2: And where are you from, Jack?
Speaker 1: I am from California in the United States. But I am now studying in England.
Speaker 2: What are you studying?
Speaker 1: I am studying languages. This year I am doing German and Italian.
Speaker 2: Oh, Excellent. Why don't we talk in German for a while then?
Speaker 1: Who is he?
Speaker 2: He's a famous American musician.
Speaker 1: Who's the author?
Speaker 2: It was written by Howard sounds.
Speaker 1: What do you think about it?
Speaker 2: It's great! I'Ve learned a lot form reading it.
Speaker 1: Can I read it when you're done?
Speaker 2: Sure, Bob! I'm on chapter 12 now, So I'm almost finished.
Speaker 1: How many chapters does the book have?
Speaker 2: There are 15 chapters in total.
Speaker 1: You haven't thought about it?
Speaker 2: I like it here at PCC.
Speaker 1: Why don't you just continue going to PCC?
Speaker 2: I like that idea.
Speaker 1: It's a great school.
Speaker 2: I completely agree.
Speaker 1: So, Have you made your decision yet?
Speaker 2: I'm staying right where I'm at.
Speaker 1: I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, But they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, The manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me.
Speaker 2: That's strange. But probably, It is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ”. What about your answers?
Speaker 1: Just did my best.
Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?
Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?
Speaker 2: He didn't say, But he said he would call me.
Speaker 1: Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!
Speaker 2: Oh, Steve. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not for me, Dick.
Speaker 1: I don't think she will do such a thing.
Speaker 2: But she did and made me disappointed.
Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up. A girlfriend is not everything.
Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.
Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.
Speaker 2: Oh. I just can't forget it.
Speaker 1: I see. You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more?
Speaker 2: That's right. You should give it up, Too. It's bad for your health.
Speaker 1: Stop talking like my mother. That's what she keeps saying.
Speaker 2: But it's true. It's a nasty habit. I can't think why I ever started. Anyway, It's obviously got you in its grip!
Speaker 1: What do you mean? What are you talking about?
Speaker 2: I mean you couldn't give it up!
Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.
Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.
Speaker 1: How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet?
Speaker 2: Maybe it can take effect.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah? What's it about?
Speaker 2: Well, It's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds. But besides a beautiful story, The cinematography is great. There is some really dramatic footage. It's really quite a visual feast. And the soundtrack is moving.
Speaker 1: Sounds pretty good. Is it a tragedy?
Speaker 2: The ending is a bit of a surprise. I don't want to ruin it for you.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering if you like to go to the theatre then.
Speaker 2: That's sounds great.
Speaker 1: Ok. How about give me a ring, Then?
Speaker 2: No. I'd better not.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because I don't think my husband would like it. Thank you for inviting me anyway.
Speaker 1: Come on! Don't be silly!
Speaker 2: Your present job is something better. Why do you change?
Speaker 1: Well. How do you know?
Speaker 1: I am fine. What have you been doing?
Speaker 2: Working. I've been really busy these days. I got a promotion.
Speaker 1: That's great, Congratulations!
Speaker 2: Thanks. I am feeling pretty good about myself too. You know, Bigger office, A raise and even an assistant.
Speaker 1: That's good. So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you.
Speaker 2: You are kidding.
Speaker 1: Sorry, I've no idea.
Speaker 1: You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things?
Speaker 2: Yes, Of course. Didn't you know that?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't. How high is the tax?
Speaker 2: Well, It is different in different countries. But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal.
Speaker 1: Why would the government want to tax liquor so much?
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: You know, I am poor at English, Especially spoken English.
Speaker 1: That's why you should go there, If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes, You simply will never learn English.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: Tell you what, Give me your phone number.
Speaker 1: It's 555-4321.
Speaker 2: Got it. I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday.
Speaker 1: He said I'd got the flu.
Speaker 2: Oh dear! What did he tell you to do?
Speaker 1: He told me to stay in bed for ten days.
Speaker 2: Ten days? Would you please repeat it again?
Speaker 1: Yes, Ten days.
Speaker 1: It's about their great love.
Speaker 2: Sounds interesting.
Speaker 1: Of course. Do you want to see it?
Speaker 2: Yes, Do you have tickets?
Speaker 1: No, I don't.
Speaker 2: Let's go to the theater and buy two tickets now, Shall we?
Speaker 1: Good idea. Let's goa.
Speaker 2: Ok. Let's go.
Speaker 1: I cant't believe it. You've worked here for years.
Speaker 1: I main marketreasearch, And you?
Speaker 2: I'Ve beaning worked IBM for years. I am vested personnel file system, He is the after sale survise director. He such a nice boss, I like working for him.
Speaker 1: Really? I don't believe I would met him, Is he here now?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's him over there - the taller, Handsome one. Would you let me introduce you?
Speaker 1: Thanks, That's would be lovely. You 'r right, He is kind and nice looking.
Speaker 1: Is that class really that popular?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I tried to get in last semester, But it was full by the time I registered.
Speaker 1: What other classes are you going to take?
Speaker 2: I still need to take English 201, But I really don't like writing.
Speaker 1: I took that class already. There is a lot of writing, But it's not that bad.
Speaker 2: Oh really? Who was the instructor? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from.
Speaker 1: I'll be please to if I can. What can I do for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm looking for a place to live. David thought as you are a @ agent. You might know something is suitable.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think I can help you. Why not you come around and see me? Do you know my office?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've got the address.
Speaker 1: Surprise?
Speaker 2: I thought you would like PE.
Speaker 1: I do like PE, But I am interested in science.
Speaker 2: Are you interested in science? I can't believe it.
Speaker 1: Through this course, I can learn more about the world around us clearly.
Speaker 2: Your parents would be happy if they knew that. Because you are always a naughty boy.
Speaker 1: Naughty? I'm naughty? I'm just clever. So I only do the things I am interested in.
Speaker 1: Well, $ 10 per hour, But I can keep the tips. That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening.
Speaker 2: Not bad.
Speaker 1: Actually, There's still another opening. If you are interested, You'll surely get it.
Speaker 2: That's great! I'll go there right now and speak with the boss.
Speaker 1: There's no rush. You can see him tomorrow. I'Ve told him about you. He promised to give you the job.
Speaker 1: No, Not really. Just bring yourselves. We would like to your presence.
Speaker 1: Yes. However, I believe that marriage comes by destiny. I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time.
Speaker 2: How's your married life?
Speaker 1: We're happy together now.
Speaker 2: I have to say you're a well-matched couple.
Speaker 1: Thank you!
Speaker 1: Sounds like you really learned a lot.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think she is just a little bit crazy.
Speaker 2: Crazy is too kind. Insane is more like it. Nuts! Wacko! Psycho!
Speaker 1: What position did you play?
Speaker 2: I think I tried every position, But the last few years, I played third base.
Speaker 1: I hate third base. It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast.
Speaker 2: It was scary at first, But after awhile, I got used to it. If you have fast reflexes, Then it's not really a problem. What position did you play?
Speaker 1: I played outfield. I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces.
Speaker 2: I wish I could play again, But there isn't much opportunities around here.
Speaker 1: Can I?
Speaker 2: Why not? Let me recommend a website.
Speaker 1: Ok. What does it sell?
Speaker 2: It sells almost everything you can see in the department.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 1: Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower!
Speaker 2: Whoa, Take it easy there Rambo. Don't get carried away. These weapons are not toys, And you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be.
Speaker 1: Wow, I didn't know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies!
Speaker 1: I like to use shorthand note taking.
Speaker 2: I was told once that the more time you spend writing, The less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff.
Speaker 1: Hmm. I never thought about it that way.
Speaker 2: One time I tried just listening, No notes, No pictures. I think I really learned more that day.
Speaker 1: I wish I could play a musical instrument. I love music.
Speaker 2: Nowadays, You can be a DJ. You can mix dance music. You don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing.
Speaker 1: I love to try it, But the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice.
Speaker 2: You know, You could probably get a computer program that would help you. You already have a computer, So you could use that to help you mix some music.
Speaker 1: She still loves him. That's why she feels upset. Her love is always hard and confusing...
Speaker 2: Then what about you? How are you getting on with your boyfriend?
Speaker 1: He sometimes really drives me crazy.
Speaker 1: And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock. My brother and his family will be joining us. I look forward to meeting them. Well, It's late, So I'll say good night. I'll see you early tomorrow, So I can share your Christmas morning. Good night!
Speaker 1: Look! You can see the village way down in the valley.
Speaker 2: Yes. It's a lovely view.
Speaker 1: Is everything ready now?
Speaker 2: Almost. The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel. As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married, It is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive.
Speaker 1: It is in the DX community, Room 306, No. 2 building. It is very easy to find. Just ask the guard at the entrance.
Speaker 2: Who else will come?
Speaker 1: I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor, Paul. He is a very good person. You should meet him.
Speaker 1: Well, I have a lot of work. I'll see how to goes.
Speaker 1: My roommate's having a party.
Speaker 1: I only go skiing twice a year, So it's a real treat for me.
Speaker 2: That makes sense.
Speaker 1: What things make you excited?
Speaker 2: Whenever I go to Vegas, I get really excited.
Speaker 1: Oh... That makes me excited too!
Speaker 2: Looks like anything fun makes you excited.
Speaker 1: But it is far from downtown. Living here is very inconvenient.
Speaker 2: It is very quiet and peaceful. This is what I want.
Speaker 1: Is it on the shelf?
Speaker 2: I didn't see it.
Speaker 1: Apparently somebody took that book out of the library.
Speaker 2: Will you ever get another copy?
Speaker 1: We will definitely be getting another.
Speaker 2: Could you please reserve it for me?
Speaker 1: That won't be a problem.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I really appreciate that.
Speaker 1: Does six thirty suit you?
Speaker 2: It suits us fine. We'll see you then.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Goodbye.
Speaker 1: The C building, I think.
Speaker 2: Well, That's not far away.
Speaker 1: Could you point me in that direction?
Speaker 2: Do you know what the room number is?
Speaker 1: It's C261.
Speaker 2: My next class is around there.
Speaker 1: Can you show it to me?
Speaker 2: Sure, Let's go.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm ready.
Speaker 2: Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake.
Speaker 1: These look strange.
Speaker 2: Yes, I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score. Would that be OK?
Speaker 1: Ok, Let's do the calculation.
Speaker 2: We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.
Speaker 1: Anytime after six will be fine.
Speaker 2: All right, It's a date.
Speaker 1: Do you write or call them very much?
Speaker 2: Yes, I try to keep in touch with them.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Do you know what time it is?
Speaker 1: Sure. It's 5:10 PM.
Speaker 2: What did you say?
Speaker 1: I said it's 5:10 PM.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: That's true. I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net. Customers, In turn, Can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It'll be a shoppers heaven. That's the use of net in E-commerce.
Speaker 1: You always act like this when you'Ve fallen in love. Who is he? How did you meet?
Speaker 2: His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos. He works with my sister who lives there.
Speaker 1: Was it love at first sight?
Speaker 2: Not really. I wasn't looking for a holiday romance, But my sister told me that she had promised him that she'd set him up on blind date with me. I didn't think I'd have anything to lose, So I went.
Speaker 1: And?
Speaker 2: Let's just say that by the third date, We both realized that we had fallen in love.
Speaker 1: When did you begin to smoke?
Speaker 2: I had my first cigarette when I was 17.
Speaker 1: Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?
Speaker 2: Yes. Twice.
Speaker 1: If life were easy, Then we'd achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, It's inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed.
Speaker 1: The people don't really work out there. They just stand around and talk all the time.
Speaker 2: Oh, It's one of those places.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Is your club different?
Speaker 2: Well, They have different rooms. I lift weights by the pool where there aren't so many people.
Speaker 1: Do they have a lot of equipment?
Speaker 2: Yeah, They have all the machines, A pool, And a steam room and sauna.
Speaker 1: How did you like it?
Speaker 2: It's fantastic.
Speaker 1: Why did you go there?
Speaker 2: I went there on business.
Speaker 1: And do you have friends there?
Speaker 2: Yes, A lot of friends.
Speaker 1: You must have enjoyed yourself.
Speaker 2: Yes, And I look many pictures.
Speaker 1: Though they were ugly, They had great virtue.
Speaker 2: Then who were they?
Speaker 1: Mo Mu, Thong Lichen, Meng Gang and Ran Nv. They were well respected.
Speaker 2: It seems that the inner beauty is also important.
Speaker 1: Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful.
Speaker 1: But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat.
Speaker 1: Don't be that negative.
Speaker 2: Really, Life is so boring.
Speaker 1: A minute, Please.... Yes, This way, Please.
Speaker 1: Hey, Do you know any mystery belief serve the festival?
Speaker 2: Such as?
Speaker 1: You know why fire crackers are set off in festival.
Speaker 2: Why? To welcome the new year of course?
Speaker 1: And also to frighten away evil spirits.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year.
Speaker 1: Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims?
Speaker 2: Why not? That's a good idea to help them.
Speaker 1: There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate.
Speaker 2: Mmmm. That sounds like something I had in Mexico once.
Speaker 1: Good stuff... Oh, No. The door is locked.
Speaker 2: Ohhhhh! And I just got all my juices going!
Speaker 1: I'd love to but I'm afraid I can't. I'Ve already got a lunch engagement.
Speaker 1: Stop acting like this. Say away!
Speaker 2: Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher. I can not accept that.
Speaker 1: What did she say?
Speaker 2: She said she want a man with large house, Luxurious car and healthy parents.
Speaker 1: Give her up.
Speaker 1: What a bummer! You set me up?
Speaker 2: Let me explain. I didn't mean to hurt you...
Speaker 1: How dare you!
Speaker 2: Hang on a second. Hear me out, Just this once, Isabella!
Speaker 1: Why did you lie to me in the email?
Speaker 2: I didn't lie. You just didn't ask me my real name.
Speaker 1: Where it is?
Speaker 2: It's a private garden.
Speaker 1: That's amazing!
Speaker 1: That's too much for us really.
Speaker 2: Where are you going now?
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to find out where the school is located.
Speaker 2: When do you start school?
Speaker 1: I'm going to register right now.
Speaker 2: That's good.
Speaker 1: That sounds nice. How do you spend your mornings?
Speaker 2: I usually do housework in mornings. I go shopping occasionally. I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket. I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center. It takes about.
Speaker 1: How do you spend your afternoons?
Speaker 2: I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies. I spend winter evening watching tv, But I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time.
Speaker 1: Do you somewhere often, Laura?
Speaker 2: Huh? I can't hear you, The music's too loud.
Speaker 1: Let's go outside and talk. So Laura, Do you come here often?
Speaker 2: Hold on, My ears are still ringing from the music... What was it you asked me?
Speaker 1: I asked if you come here often.
Speaker 2: Sometimes, Usually once every few weeks. Do you?
Speaker 1: No, This is my first time here.
Speaker 2: I usually come with a group of friends. We dance a little, Have a few drinks, And just have a good time.
Speaker 1: Yes, He stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.
Speaker 2: Did they catch him?
Speaker 1: Yes. After two U.S. Fighter jets followed him for an hour, He landed on a highway.
Speaker 2: Did he crash?
Speaker 1: No, He just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
Speaker 2: Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?
Speaker 1: His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
Speaker 2: Poor guy.
Speaker 1: Not for now, I think, But I believe there'll be rain, So take your raincoat with you.
Speaker 1: Which team do you back then?
Speaker 1: I will be driving my car.
Speaker 2: Ok, That will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?
Speaker 1: I'll pay for it with a check.
Speaker 2: Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?
Speaker 1: No, Thanks ; I'm fine.

Speaker 1: I've already got it. Thanks.
Speaker 2: I will explain it in detail in the next class, Could you preview it?
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 1: Just because he gets on well with everybody?
Speaker 2: Partly, And he's also a hard working man.
Speaker 1: What's it like?
Speaker 2: It's beautiful but crowded.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, But I also worry about grades.
Speaker 2: Grades are important, But don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, Too?
Speaker 1: I really need to learn this stuff.
Speaker 2: He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Yes, That sounds right for me.
Speaker 1: That's impossible! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith.
Speaker 2: Yes, Ma'am. He died from complications of stomach cancer. I'm very sorry.
Speaker 1: I'm really sick!
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: If you did, You probably got ripped off.
Speaker 1: Ok. And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree?
Speaker 2: It can be completed in four years normally.
Speaker 1: I see. Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: It's the Powell orchestra.
Speaker 2: Do you know what they are playing?
Speaker 1: They're doing a seventeenth-century program.
Speaker 2: And who is directing?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not sure of his name, But I know it's going to be his farewell performance.
Speaker 1: You wouldn't! If you leave, You'll make nothing.
Speaker 2: I might make nothing even if I stay. For that kind of risk, I want to get rich.
Speaker 1: Ok. If you sign the Stars. Com account before WebTracker does, We'll talk next week.
Speaker 1: Nope, Sorry! Actually, Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor!
Speaker 1: No, Just bring yourself. I hope to see you there.
Speaker 1: Would you like another beer?
Speaker 2: I'II have another cup of beer insist. I know I don't like to drink alone, Especially there are someone sitting there next to me.
Speaker 1: Come on, It's the weekend. Let's taste and enjoy this meal. Cheers!
Speaker 2: Bottom's up, And you're right. This meal is incredible. I wish I had known this restaurant before. Thanks for bringing me here. I know I'll be back soon.
Speaker 1: What gift?
Speaker 2: It's an Egyptian carpet. The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude. Seeing what gift was, I was really uncomfortable. I mean it's too expensive a gift.
Speaker 1: You refused the gift? That's terrible.
Speaker 2: I know, But I really can't accept such an expensive gift. I explained to him why, But he seemed really upset about it. I think he might have taken it the wrong way.
Speaker 1: I hope I can stay here longer.
Speaker 2: When will your vacation end?
Speaker 1: The day after tomorrow.
Speaker 2: You will go back tomorrow, Right?
Speaker 1: Yes, You are right.
Speaker 1: True, A sea food restaurant.
Speaker 2: True? The food is terrible.
Speaker 1: I didn't notice. I don't really even know what I ate.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: I've already got mine.
Speaker 2: ( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve! Time to open presents!
Speaker 1: Here! Open mine first.
Speaker 2: Wow! It's just what I wanted!
Speaker 1: Hey! Why don't I have any presents!
Speaker 1: Who wouldn't? Wow, That's out of this world.
Speaker 2: It is special, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Too cool. How much did they sold you for?
Speaker 2: Lots. Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years.
Speaker 1: I can imagine.
Speaker 2: Hey, Let's go for a spin. You can try it out.
Speaker 1: I'd love to.
Speaker 2: Ok, Let's go.
Speaker 1: It's half past twelve.
Speaker 2: When do you have lunch?
Speaker 1: From one to two.
Speaker 2: What do you normally eat?
Speaker 1: We usually go to the cafeteria.
Speaker 2: Oh, It's time to have lunch now.
Speaker 1: Let's go together.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality. I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay.
Speaker 2: You are most welcome.
Speaker 1: I'm afraid I have to go now. The plane will take off soon.
Speaker 2: Call us as soon as you got home.
Speaker 1: But that's a lot of money! Honey!
Speaker 1: I was sick that day, And couldn't make it.
Speaker 2: Well, Here are the notes.
Speaker 1: Are there any more?
Speaker 2: Sorry, Here you go.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: What do you like doing in your spare time?
Speaker 2: I like doing aerobics in my spare time. It's good for my health.
Speaker 1: Do you have any hobbies?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have. I collect stamps, Chinese stamps as well as those from other countries.
Speaker 1: I hope so. Let me know how many will come. Then I will book the restaurant.
Speaker 1: What school?
Speaker 2: I transferred here from PCC.
Speaker 1: Do you like it here?
Speaker 2: I really like it here so far.
Speaker 1: Do you like it better here or at PCC?
Speaker 2: I like PCC better.
Speaker 1: If that's the case, Then why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree.
Speaker 1: Fine, I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area, Food there is pretty spicy too. Shall we try that one?
Speaker 2: Ok with me. You are the boss. I will meet you downstairs after work.
Speaker 1: Well, You could never tell about the weather here in New York.
Speaker 2: Yes, That's true. Still, It's hard to believe. Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
Speaker 1: As far as I know, People will be weak if they swim too long.
Speaker 2: That's right. But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming.
Speaker 1: Is it very dangerous? I'm a little scared. Do you offer the lifebuoy for us?
Speaker 1: No. Thanks for reminding me.
Speaker 1: My employer. Can you come in to the office tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere.
Speaker 1: That would be the real proof. Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane?
Speaker 2: Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's a disco. Let's dance.
Speaker 2: You're a good dancer.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Now they are playing a rumba. Would you have a try?
Speaker 2: Sorry. I feel like sitting out the next dance.
Speaker 1: Ok. Let's get something to drink.
Speaker 2: Good idea.
Speaker 1: Poor Kevin, We should do something for him. He is a nice guy and does his job well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I agree with you. But you know, It's just one of those things.
Speaker 1: How far is it from here?
Speaker 2: It is near the university. Five minutes 'walk from your flat, I think.
Speaker 1: Well how about meeting at my place?
Speaker 2: That sounds good. I'll call you once I arrive.
Speaker 1: I want you to cut my hair shorter.
Speaker 2: How short?
Speaker 1: I want my hair to be only a few inches long.
Speaker 2: Do you really want it that short?
Speaker 1: Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now.
Speaker 2: If you really want me to, Then I'll do it.
Speaker 1: I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want.
Speaker 2: Let's do it.
Speaker 1: Oh, Lovely. Where's the wedding going to be?
Speaker 2: Well .. we're not sure yet, Probably in St. Albans.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes, Your parents live there, Don't they?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's right.
Speaker 1: Where are you going to live after you're married?
Speaker 2: We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London.
Speaker 1: Are you going to give up your job?
Speaker 2: Yes, Probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Li Mei. Come into the dining room. I'm going to cut the cake soon.
Speaker 2: What wish do you make?
Speaker 1: It's a secret.
Speaker 1: Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills? I use direct debit.
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. It save me a lot of time. I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines.
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, The harder to make a decision.
Speaker 2: Toss a coin to decide then.
Speaker 1: I wish he could too.
Speaker 2: How's your boy, Jack?
Speaker 1: He's a bit tired, You know. It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up.
Speaker 2: Poor boys! They work harder at school nowadays, Don't they?
Speaker 1: Good luck to them.
Speaker 1: No, I don't like museums. They're boring.
Speaker 2: Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building?
Speaker 1: Ah! That sounds interesting.
Speaker 1: It was many years ago, When I was a little child. It was the middle of the night, And I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen. I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, When...
Speaker 2: So that's where you saw the ghost? In your house? What did it look like? Was it hideous?
Speaker 1: It was a big, Green thing that looked like a person. It was in the kitchen, And it slowly moved towards the stairs...
Speaker 2: So what did you do?
Speaker 1: I know girls love this kind of car. Look, It's got a sunroof! Imagine... A cool, Starry night...
Speaker 2: So, You're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks?
Speaker 1: No. I borrowed it to go shopping.
Speaker 1: No. Not now. I think I'll try to keep this one.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Well, If you ever pass my home, Please drop in.
Speaker 2: Yes, I will. Take care, Then.
Speaker 1: Yes, Sure. Have a sweet dream!
Speaker 1: The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low. Would you like me to cut them off for you?
Speaker 2: Thank you! That would be very kind of you. I have a saw in the garden shed.
Speaker 1: When the lower branches are removed, You'll be able to sit under the tree.
Speaker 2: Tomorrow, I'll cut the grass. Then the garden will look perfect.
Speaker 1: She married Jerrod.
Speaker 2: You're kidding.
Speaker 1: She's going to live in Paris.
Speaker 2: Really? I'm surprised.
Speaker 1: How long have you been feeling this way?
Speaker 2: Only since this morning.
Speaker 1: Oh, Probably you've been working too hard.
Speaker 2: Maybe you are right.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 1: I noticed that too. What are the people learning?
Speaker 2: In my country, They are usually studying something business-related, Such as marketing, Management techniques, And human resource management.
Speaker 1: You mean Sweet Heart.
Speaker 2: Yes. In fact, I think it's much better than this week's No. 1.
Speaker 1: What do you think about Cold Wind?
Speaker 2: I like it as well, But I don't think it's as good as Sweet Heart.
Speaker 1: So No. 4 is your favorite. Which one don't you like?
Speaker 2: Well. I don't like Your Lips very much.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I think it's too slow makes me sleepy. In fact, It's the worst in this week's top ten, If you ask me.
Speaker 1: Your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren't careful! Why don't you try being more decisive? Start with some basic ones. When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at,Mak.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. You're very decisive, I'Ve noticed. So, Which bar are we going to this evening?
Speaker 1: I can't make a decision. You'll have to put forward an idea.
Speaker 1: Maybe you are right.
Speaker 1: I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about.
Speaker 2: I'd love to help if I can.
Speaker 1: Well, As you know, I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far, But I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work... Maybe even get a Doctorate!
Speaker 2: Wow! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain.
Speaker 1: But you have a Master's degree... Hasn't that helped your career?
Speaker 1: But you're in China. Are you planning on going home for Christmas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, So I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave.
Speaker 1: Why not just give them money in red envelopes? That would be much easier.
Speaker 2: Americans don't like giving money, They prefer presents you buy for them. So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends.
Speaker 1: I've got it. I won't bother you any more. You'd better hurry to do it, Christmas is just around the corner.
Speaker 2: I will. Merry Christmas.
Speaker 1: Do you live with your family?
Speaker 2: Yes, We live a happy life together.
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: Like for example, If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.
Speaker 1: I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.
Speaker 2: You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!
Speaker 1: Well, I have no regrets!
Speaker 1: I'm looking for information on tropical fish.
Speaker 2: All right. You can use the computer over there, Enter 'tropical fish'under subject. If you know the title of the book, Enter it under' title '.
Speaker 1: Great, Thank you.
Speaker 2: You are welcome.
Speaker 1: No. You go ahead and putt it out. Then I'Il go.
Speaker 2: No way, Mary. I'm going to let you go first. I don't want the pressure of putting first.
Speaker 1: And then?
Speaker 2: Take the next right. Drive about one click further, And you'll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.
Speaker 2: I heard they were just married for 5 months.
Speaker 1: Yes, She said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden.
Speaker 1: You said it. You know, They fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.
Speaker 2: Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.
Speaker 1: Yeah. We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners.
Speaker 1: Well, I work in the marketing department. The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer. Before, When I was assigned a task, I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don.
Speaker 2: That's really good. It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work.
Speaker 1: Indeed. Team work is highly valued in this new company. I like our boss too. He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation. He's highly respected by all his employees.
Speaker 2: That's great, That's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees. I wish my boss was like that.
Speaker 1: No-one really believes gossip columnists.
Speaker 2: I think you'll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns. You'd also have to be very careful about every word you said. If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly, It.
Speaker 1: Yes, I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds. But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here.
Speaker 1: Who will sing in the show?
Speaker 2: A lot of stars, Including Andy, Justin, Mendy...
Speaker 1: Mendy? Are you sure? I love her songs!
Speaker 2: Me too. She is so young and talented. She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Though she was so popular, I heard she managed to maintain a low profile.
Speaker 1: Do you own your own darkroom?
Speaker 2: No, Usually I get my films developed at a photo studio, But I make my own enlargements.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative. That's more, But that saves money.
Speaker 1: And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, Or from the government.
Speaker 2: Wow, You'Ve inspired me to do something!
Speaker 1: I know. You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, A big school or a small school, A public or private school...
Speaker 2: Yup, You understand. And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college. They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline. And the tuition is usually pretty low.
Speaker 1: I see. Well, Don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school. He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction. He gave me some information, And next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended.
Speaker 2: Thanks for the information. And good luck in your college search.
Speaker 1: She is a clever mother.
Speaker 1: ThenSOHO is your ideal work style.
Speaker 2: Yeah, As long as I have a computer and internet access, I can start working. I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace.
Speaker 1: Are you rushing me?
Speaker 2: I am just reminding you about the time. You don't want to miss the plane, Do you?
Speaker 1: I know what I am doing. Don't worry. Can you do me a favor?
Speaker 2: Name it and I'll do it for you.
Speaker 1: Take care of Pamela when I am away. She is a nice girl. I don't want her to get hurt or anything.
Speaker 2: I've got it.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Now I see that you are my true friend. Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt. You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time.
Speaker 1: What will the weather be like tomorrow?
Speaker 2: It's going to be sunny tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Who is he?
Speaker 2: He's a famous American musician.
Speaker 1: Who's the author?
Speaker 2: It was written by Howard Sounds.
Speaker 1: What do you think about it?
Speaker 2: It's great! I'Ve learned a lot from reading it.
Speaker 1: Can I read it when you're done?
Speaker 2: Sure, Bob! I'm on chapter 12 now, So I'm almost finished.
Speaker 1: How many chapters does the book have?
Speaker 2: There are 15 chapters in total.
Speaker 2: Not bad, Just let it go.
Speaker 1: Yes, It's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy.
Speaker 2: Have you thought about wearing a hat?
Speaker 1: Everywhere I go?
Speaker 2: Well, It's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out!
Speaker 1: Absolutely! I don't think any planes are going anywhere. The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters. But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest.
Speaker 2: That's exactly where I was planning to go!
Speaker 1: Well, This storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China. At the moment, That area is calmer.
Speaker 1: That's silly. What I do on my own time is no one else's business. Besides, It's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here.
Speaker 2: You'Ve got a point. Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism. Then when the relationship went bad, He fired me.
Speaker 1: People fall in love with people they work with. That's a fact.
Speaker 2: That may be true, But I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity.
Speaker 1: I might do that too. I hope the weather is nice. I could go and play some golf.
Speaker 2: I heard that the weather should be good. There's a possibility of a shower, But it's not very likely.
Speaker 1: Hopefully, We'll both have relaxing weekends.
Speaker 2: Of course, Something could come up and stop that wish coming true.
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, There's always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention.
Speaker 1: That's too much for us really.
Speaker 2: Where are you going now?
Speaker 1: I'm going to try to find out where the school is located.
Speaker 2: When do you start school?
Speaker 1: I'm going to register right now.
Speaker 2: That's good.
Speaker 1: I see. Oh, Well some other time perhaps.
Speaker 2: Yes. Some other time perhaps. Thanks again.
Speaker 1: Were you in or out? Can you remember that?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite positive. I think I went out at about half pass nine.
Speaker 1: Did you see anyone come into the block flats?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Sure?
Speaker 2: Quite sure.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 1: Have you treated any real emergencies?
Speaker 2: Well, They took us along with some paramedics. There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures. His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital. It was intense!
Speaker 1: I can imagine! I tend to faint when I see blood, So I think I won't be taking up a course like that anytime soon!
Speaker 1: Oh. I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday.
Speaker 2: She's terribly sorry about that. She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week. She hopes you understand.
Speaker 1: Is there someone else I can talk to?
Speaker 2: She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today. When are you free today?
Speaker 1: Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me.
Speaker 1: I know you're right, But what can I do?
Speaker 2: How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night?
Speaker 1: But I'll miss the news. It's important in my business to keep up with events in China.
Speaker 1: It was a round day for me. My family attend the graduation ceremony. I was so nervous. I couldn't find my cap and gown, But all worked out in the end.
Speaker 2: What did you do after graduation?
Speaker 1: I was planning to attend gradate school, But then I was offered a good job doing marketing, So I changed my mind.
Speaker 2: Sounds like you're happy with your decision.
Speaker 1: I sure am. So what about you? How did you feel when you graduated?
Speaker 1: He married a girl who is only eighteen!
Speaker 2: Is that true? But anyhow, It's none of our business, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Oh, I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet.
Speaker 1: Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now?
Speaker 2: No, But I'll be able to tomorrow.
Speaker 1: That's right. Now this one looks alright? It's a detached or do you prefer this one? It's Sony.
Speaker 2: Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration.
Speaker 1: No way! They want publicity for themselves, So that they get invited to make more films, Go to lots of cocktail parties, And even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for Drin.
Speaker 2: Show biz stars have plenty of expenses. That's why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, Seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea.
Speaker 1: Two months? How did you find out?
Speaker 2: I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, And I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately.
Speaker 1: So you asked him about the girl who called?
Speaker 2: Yeah, He first said it was someone from work. He gave me a lame excuse, And so I pressed him on it.
Speaker 1: Are you sure? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?
Speaker 2: Really? You've read books about it? Ok, Then. But only if you want to.
Speaker 1: Ok, Let's see, Well, You've got a long life line, Which is good, And the love line is strong...
Speaker 2: What else do you see? Will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?
Speaker 1: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
Speaker 1: You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah! Would you please welcome... Miss Jan Brown.
Speaker 1: Who cares? It's just online. It's not real. Do you want to join me tonight?
Speaker 2: Thanks, But I'm a lousy typist.
Speaker 1: We had extra time of course.
Speaker 2: I can believe that.
Speaker 1: No, We are just too different. This isn't working.
Speaker 2: Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.
Speaker 1: I have thought about it for a while. I think it's time to move on for both of us.
Speaker 2: But I still love you.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I knew this would happen some day...
Speaker 1: Then why didn't you talk to me?
Speaker 2: Well. It's not all my fault, Anna...
Speaker 1: What about birth control pills? Don't they work on Italians?
Speaker 2: Ha-ha. Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family.
Speaker 1: And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos.
Speaker 1: True. The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities.
Speaker 2: Definitely. I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month.
Speaker 1: Yeah, It's true. What is she going to do?
Speaker 2: Well, She is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community.
Speaker 1: That's not bad. It could be a short-term alternative. Your mum can look for another one when the market improves. Things will work out eventually.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I just hope she won't feel pressed.
Speaker 1: That's tough. What does your wife think about this?
Speaker 2: She's trying to be supportive, But I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well.
Speaker 1: I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job. I'll see what they can do.
Speaker 2: I really appreciate your help.
Speaker 1: No problem. In the meantime, Don't try to worry so much. You'll get through this.
Speaker 1: Yes, I could.
Speaker 2: You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up?
Speaker 1: I'll make it up early next week.
Speaker 2: That would work, But don't let it happen again.
Speaker 1: I'll try.
Speaker 2: That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again.
Speaker 1: So, We could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook. Then we could go to a club. We haven't been to one for ages.
Speaker 2: That's a great idea. We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids.
Speaker 1: You mean used car?
Speaker 2: No, Ah... Single sellers.
Speaker 1: Well, Yeah, But I'd be getting somebody else's problem.
Speaker 2: Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now.
Speaker 1: It's the same kind of deal though, You know, You never know what you're going to get.
Speaker 2: Oh, Hey, How about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car.
Speaker 1: Let's look at them all. Have you got a paper there?
Speaker 1: I'm Mary. I can't find my American literature class.
Speaker 2: What room is it?
Speaker 1: It's 112.
Speaker 2: It's on the first floor by the nurse's office.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot, Brad. I've got to go before the bell rings.
Speaker 1: It's so nice of you. You really make my day.
Speaker 2: Forget it! We seemingly need to gather money little by little.
Speaker 1: What you said is absolutely right. I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet.
Speaker 2: No rush. You can give it back whenever you have it.
Speaker 1: No, But I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work.
Speaker 2: Are you going to go right away?
Speaker 1: I am leaving right now.
Speaker 2: All right, But please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up.
Speaker 1: Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of.
Speaker 2: Goodbye, And try not to miss any more school.
Speaker 1: Sorry, What was your last name again?
Speaker 2: It's Nugent, N-U-G-E-N-T, But just call me Ted.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'm Tom.
Speaker 2: Glad to meet you.
Speaker 1: And what do you do, Ted?
Speaker 2: Me? I'm in the car business.
Speaker 1: Salesman?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's right. And how about you?
Speaker 1: I work for American Airlines.
Speaker 2: Oh, Really? What do you do there exactly?
Speaker 1: Yes, I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds. But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here.
Speaker 1: Oh, So he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, Then?
Speaker 2: Right now he speaks mostly Chinese, And he can say a few English words. But he will learn.
Speaker 1: What does he look like? Can people tell?
Speaker 1: It's the Powell orchestra.
Speaker 2: Do you know what they are playing?
Speaker 1: They're doing a seventeenth-century program.
Speaker 2: And who is directing?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not sure of his name, But I know it's going to be his farewell performance.
Speaker 1: So Baltimore is winning?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is a really great place to watch a baseball game.
Speaker 2: Yeah, There isn't a bad seat in the place.
Speaker 1: The fans are great here, Too. Not like in Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game.
Speaker 1: Yeah, It reminds you why they say baseball is America's favorite pastime.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your delicious meal.
Speaker 1: Let's string the lights first. Then we won't have to mess up the decorations.
Speaker 2: Hand me some globes and paper flowers, I'll put them on these top branches.
Speaker 1: There,... We're about done.
Speaker 2: Let's switch the lights on.
Speaker 1: Ok. Here goes.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas.
Speaker 1: It's Friday.
Speaker 2: Good. Where shall we meet?
Speaker 1: Why? What does she want to be?
Speaker 2: She wants to be a manager.
Speaker 1: What classes does she take?
Speaker 2: She takes classes in accounting and business.
Speaker 1: So, Wily, You have been with IBM for two years ready for change?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I'm ready for new challenges.
Speaker 1: Just in Beijing, People consume 300, 000 pieces of gum every day.
Speaker 2: That's amazing.
Speaker 1: If all the people spit out the gum like you, The whole world would become a big trash can.
Speaker 2: Come on, You are making too big deal out of this.
Speaker 1: I just want to remind you to behave yourself.
Speaker 2: Ok, Dear sister, I see. This kind of thing will not happen again.
Speaker 1: I like my hair so much.
Speaker 2: Do you really?
Speaker 1: It's beautiful.
Speaker 2: Well, Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: How much is it for my hair?
Speaker 2: You owe me $ 55.
Speaker 1: Thanks for everything.
Speaker 2: You are very welcome. Come back again.
Speaker 1: Doctors aren't sure yet. But the real problem is Suzy. She has a bad cold, And we don't want to take her with us. But we don't know who can stay with her.
Speaker 2: You need a babysitter.
Speaker 1: Yes, I'd ask Jill, The girl I've had before, But I need someone overnight. Maybe even for two nights.
Speaker 2: I could have Suzy stay at my place.
Speaker 1: I don't want to do that to you, Karen.
Speaker 1: I'm sure there'll be canned! And there also might be some legal consequences.
Speaker 2: Why would the person who told have problems with the law?
Speaker 1: Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality.
Speaker 1: Thanks. Some tea would be nice. Chinese tea is great. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it?
Speaker 2: Oh, There is a supermarket not far from here. But there is also a tea house around the corner, Where you can get tea, Taste tea and get a tea set as well.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I saw the tea house the other day. I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here.
Speaker 2: You are right about that. It's quiet and very convenient. You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes 'walk. There's a grocery store, A book store, A gym, And many restaurants along the street.
Speaker 1: Do they have a good team?
Speaker 2: I think they do, But I'm biased. They have a good manager and a great coach.
Speaker 1: I can't keep up with the game. The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing.
Speaker 2: I have the same problem. The players are really very skilful. I wish I could play that well.
Speaker 1: You play for an amateur team, Don't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. We're doing pretty well this season. We'Ve won most of our games, But we're not top of the league table.
Speaker 1: I have an appointment at one fifteen.
Speaker 1: Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort?
Speaker 2: Certainly! The most attractive place is that, It's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace. The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it.
Speaker 1: It sounds great, And is it really cool there?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think the reason is that there is a big lake, And many trees in the Resort.
Speaker 1: Take care of yourself.
Speaker 2: I will. Bye, Mom.
Speaker 1: Bye, My boy.
Speaker 1: How big is a shuffle iPod?
Speaker 2: The first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first.
Speaker 1: How many gigs of music can it hold?
Speaker 2: I think it's either one or two gigs. I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Did you check the computer?
Speaker 2: I already looked.
Speaker 1: Did it say anything?
Speaker 2: It said that the book is on the shelf, But it isn't.
Speaker 1: I'm sure I can get it from another library.
Speaker 2: Could you do that?
Speaker 1: I'll let you know when I get the book in.
Speaker 2: That's great. Thank you so much.
Speaker 1: We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house.
Speaker 2: Oh good! Can I bring anything?
Speaker 1: We will be providing hot dogs, Hamburgers, And cake, But people can bring side dishes.
Speaker 2: I am assuming that the dress is casual.
Speaker 1: Dress casually and bring your bathing suit!
Speaker 2: Wonderful. Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there.
Speaker 1: I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last.
Speaker 2: Yeah, That's nice.
Speaker 1: Hmm, I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home.
Speaker 1: Stones? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones?
Speaker 2: Yes, Stones.
Speaker 1: Well, I can't just image it.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much!
Speaker 2: How are your cases coming along?
Speaker 1: Very well, Thanks, I will probably finish next week, But this is still a lot of work, I have been worked on in for six months, And i'm so closed to end. I can feel it.
Speaker 2: Wow, Good for you. It sounds like a lot of work. I'm proud of you! Is this the right building?
Speaker 1: Yes, It's only eight forty. Thanks so much!
Speaker 2: You're welcome. Good luck, Bye!
Speaker 1: They're all waiting for you. Let's join them. I'm going to cut the cake soon.
Speaker 2: Let's go.
Speaker 1: Would you like to clear the table then?
Speaker 2: Really? Do I have to do it?
Speaker 1: Not, If you don't want to.
Speaker 2: Well, Isn't there anything you want?
Speaker 1: Yes, I want to go out. Would you like to come?
Speaker 2: No, Why should I? I don't feel like it. Besides, I'm in such a bad mood.
Speaker 1: You did a good job. But I got tired of working in the garden.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well. I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day. In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected.
Speaker 1: Yes. Thanks.
Speaker 1: Have a guess.
Speaker 2: A necklace?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Open it now.
Speaker 2: Oh, My god. A diamond brooch. It's so beautiful. You're so kind to me, A. Thank you!
Speaker 1: You're welcome, Honey. I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future.
Speaker 1: Easy. It's on me.
Speaker 2: In that case, I'm right behind you.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, We can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.
Speaker 1: What else can we do to protect the environment?
Speaker 2: If you do have to drive, You should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, Your home should use sources of renewable energy.
Speaker 1: Just kidding, Mikel. Why don't you come work out with me?
Speaker 2: Ah, I don't know a fit works. Last time, All I saw the gym were bunch of lidos, Like me.
Speaker 1: It works if you keep at it. Come on, Let's go!
Speaker 2: All right. But so help me it's a better work.
Speaker 1: This feels great. I'm allreed up. I can keep going all night.
Speaker 2: Not me. I'm too hot and I'm too tired.
Speaker 1: Can you teach me how to do make-up?
Speaker 2: Of course. First, Use eye shadow to heighten your eyes.
Speaker 1: What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me?
Speaker 2: I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls.
Speaker 1: How do you protect yourself from chapped lips?
Speaker 2: I suggest you use lipstick, Which also accentuates your lips.
Speaker 1: How did you grow such long nails?
Speaker 1: Are you? Who's the lucky girl?
Speaker 2: Her name is Jenny.
Speaker 1: How did you meet her?
Speaker 2: We are in the same math class. Our teacher sat us next to each other.
Speaker 1: What do you like best about her?
Speaker 2: She's very funny. She makes me laugh all the time.
Speaker 1: I guess it was fate working to bring you together.
Speaker 2: Whatever brought us together, I'm happy.
Speaker 1: Don't worry, I will teach you how to win.
Speaker 2: Ok, Settled then.
Speaker 1: See you tomorrow.
Speaker 2: See you!
Speaker 1: No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, But in other countries it is.
Speaker 1: Is it really worth paying for?
Speaker 2: I can't tell yet. I haven't got beyond the first chapter.
Speaker 1: If it's any good, I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition.
Speaker 1: What else did you see?
Speaker 2: Art galleries, Cathedrals, Statues, Fountains, Palaces, Bistros, There's really too much to say.
Speaker 1: You must have had a great time.
Speaker 2: Yes, At the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun. However, On the third day of travelling in the city, I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening.
Speaker 1: Yes. You need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad. Sometimes new food might disagree with you.
Speaker 2: On the fourth day, We went to taste the French cuisine. That was really fantastic. And no stomach problems.
Speaker 1: So, Did you go to college right away?
Speaker 2: No, Because my English wasn't very good. I studied English for two years first.
Speaker 1: Wow, Your English is really fluent now.
Speaker 2: Thanks. Your English is pretty good, Too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, But I was born here!!
Speaker 1: Sorry. There are only some seats in the back.
Speaker 2: Well, What time does it begin?
Speaker 1: It begins at 7 p.M ...
Speaker 2: Ok. I see.
Speaker 1: How many tickets do you want?
Speaker 2: Just two.
Speaker 1: Ok. Fifty yuan for each.
Speaker 2: Here is the money.
Speaker 1: You are right. Let's stop idling around and do something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Time is money. We really need to make good use of it.
Speaker 1: Well, You can simply tell them you want to sleep, Or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, But I find these sorts of things hard to say. They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV. Now I just hope the show will end soon.
Speaker 1: I understand. I used to live in a dorm with four people. I was great in some aspects. We always went out and and had fun together. But on the other hand, When I wanted some quiet time, And people kept.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I crave my own space. I just so tired of having people around me all time.
Speaker 1: Thank you for a wonderful meal.
Speaker 2: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Oh, Do you like Chinese?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm eager to learn Chinese, But it is too difficult for me.
Speaker 1: I want to study German. Can we exchange lessons?
Speaker 2: Very Good. I'd like to do that.
Speaker 1: When will we begin?
Speaker 2: How about tomorrow night?
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 1: I was happy to help.
Speaker 2: It was so kind of you.
Speaker 1: Don't mention it.
Speaker 2: You're a real friend in need.
Speaker 1: Sounds great.
Speaker 1: It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?
Speaker 2: Sure. But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike.
Speaker 2: Wow. You must have been pretty far away from the city.
Speaker 1: Yeah, My friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.
Speaker 1: What! That wasn't a foul! C 'mon, Ref!
Speaker 2: Don't worry, Shan always screws up free throws.
Speaker 1: You were right! He didn't make the shot!
Speaker 2: That was a great shot! A three pointer, Yeah!
Speaker 1: Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!
Speaker 2: This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, Open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!
Speaker 1: Okay... End of the first quarter... Alright, I'm gonna make a beer run.
Speaker 1: Poor Kevin, We should do something for him. He is a nice guy and does his job well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I agree with you. But you know, It's just one of those things.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I am not a child at all. I know more.
Speaker 1: Oh, My son looks like a grown-up.
Speaker 2: Sure. Mom, I can take care of you.
Speaker 1: No kidding. So tell me what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like blue. You see, That's the color of the sky. I wanna be a superman.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I hope I can fly to any place like superman. So I can touch the sky.
Speaker 1: Ok, Superman. Put on your cape, We are going to fly home.
Speaker 1: A little, I wish I could do that.
Speaker 2: You can! With a little practice.
Speaker 1: Look at him, He's buff.
Speaker 2: I think he's hot too.
Speaker 1: How do they all get in suchtiptop shape?
Speaker 2: Exercised over and over. Exercise is a key.
Speaker 1: That's it. I decided to turn over a new leaf. I'm going to exercise every single day.
Speaker 2: Good for you, Leslie!
Speaker 1: What's wrong with it?
Speaker 2: Well, First of all, It needs a new engine, Which is extremely expensive.
Speaker 1: When's the last time you had it serviced?
Speaker 2: It must have been a few years ago now.
Speaker 1: I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.
Speaker 2: They do. Once my son was born, There was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, You know!
Speaker 1: No, Not really. Just bring yourselves. We would like to your presence.
Speaker 1: Just fine. I say. Aren't you busy tomorrow evening?
Speaker 2: Let me see. Uh-huh... No, I guess I'll be free.
Speaker 1: Well, Uh... Why notdine out together and go to the movies?
Speaker 2: Sounds like a good idea.
Speaker 1: Okay. I'll pick you up at 6:00.
Speaker 2: Thank you for inviting me. See you then. Bye, Tom.
Speaker 1: What is your least favorite ice cream?
Speaker 2: I don't like peppermint ice cream.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Speaker 2: One time, I tried garlic ice cream.
Speaker 1: That could be interesting.
Speaker 2: That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though. Let's order!
Speaker 1: Well, About an hour or so.
Speaker 2: Wow, That's quite a long journey. Do you drive a car?
Speaker 1: No. I take public transportation. It's safer.
Speaker 2: You are right! But I get up a little late. That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle.
Speaker 1: Well, Both have advantages and disadvantages.
Speaker 1: Do you think that there's life on other planets?
Speaker 2: I think there must be.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world. The world is just far too big for that.
Speaker 1: Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us?
Speaker 2: No, But we're trying to contact them.
Speaker 1: Fine today, Though a bit under the weather last week.
Speaker 1: What a jerk. He doesn't deserve you.
Speaker 2: But it still hurts. I thought I loved him.
Speaker 1: He didn't treat you that well either. Maybe you don't want to hear this, But I think you can do better.
Speaker 2: Better or worse, It doesn't matter. I had a lot of feelings for him. I really liked him.
Speaker 1: It must be really painful. I remember when Josh and I broke up. I was crying for a week.
Speaker 2: I know. I'll get over him. My first break up was painful because I was naive.
Speaker 1: Why not send E-mail through the Internet?
Speaker 2: Is it convenient and cheap?
Speaker 1: Sure. You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet. In addition, You can make a phone call through the internet, Too.
Speaker 2: Really? I'm so glad to hear that. But I don't know how to get access to the Internet. Could you show me?
Speaker 1: No problem. I'll tell you.
Speaker 2: I'll appreciate it very much.
Speaker 1: Yes, I am kidding. But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits?
Speaker 2: Yes, I know. I have a disability. My hip was broken last year. And I can't walk well.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Speaker 2: It's alright. You didn't see me walk to the desk.
Speaker 1: Here is the application form. I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university.
Speaker 2: My permission letter?
Speaker 1: How about summer?
Speaker 2: I dislike it most.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because the hottest season is summer in a year.
Speaker 1: But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.
Speaker 1: No, It isn't. It's a pity, Because I'd like to see it in action.
Speaker 2: So would I. What other unusual plants did they show?
Speaker 1: They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, When the insect collects the nectar, It also takes some pollen from one flower to another.
Speaker 2: That's very specialized. So, The insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, The other would too.
Speaker 1: Tom, That lucky guy.
Speaker 2: The guy always hands the girls in a line. When did he propose?
Speaker 1: Last week, It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs. Whit's party last Monday as soon as he saw her.
Speaker 2: My gosh! How romantic! When's the big day?
Speaker 1: July 4, The National Holiday.
Speaker 2: Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony?
Speaker 1: Jenny plans to hold it in church.
Speaker 2: Who is the best man?
Speaker 1: Have you thought about graduate school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Speaker 2: You got me.
Speaker 1: Now listen, Ben. Look, I think it's a very good thing that a young man — after he's done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, And lie around, And drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Speaker 1: Do you think you can finish it on time?
Speaker 2: Don't worry. I'll get it done very soon. I'm almost finished.
Speaker 1: You'd better hurry!
Speaker 2: Well, It would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me.
Speaker 1: Sorry!
Speaker 1: Why not! These orders are not urgent. We could do it first thing tomorrow morning.
Speaker 2: All right. Let's call it quits and go home.
Speaker 1: See. Great minds think alike.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't see the point of arguing this.
Speaker 1: No, He didn't tell me about it. Don't feel bad.
Speaker 2: I'm OK. I promise. Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time.
Speaker 1: What's to come next?
Speaker 2: If they agree to enroll you, They will send you aTAP - 66 Form. WithTAP - 66, You can apply for a passport from our government, And then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing.
Speaker 1: Do you ever get lonely living alone?
Speaker 2: Not at all. I see you and your family twice a week, And I enjoy seeing my own friends. I'm too busy to feel lonely!
Speaker 1: Yes, There were no games in 1916, 1940 and 1944, Because of World War I and World War II.
Speaker 2: I see. Look, Do you know what that emblem means? I've seen it so many times, But I don't know what it stands for.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's the Beijing 2008 Olympics 'Emblem. It's a Chinese seal, Meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world.
Speaker 1: Oh, Me too! All the family getting together...
Speaker 2: And I really like the smells and colors of spring.
Speaker 1: I like the feeling then that school is almost over!
Speaker 2: But I must say, If it were only for the weather, I like autumn most!
Speaker 1: Yeah, She's broken up about it, Poor kid.
Speaker 2: What did you do?
Speaker 1: I talked to her for a while, But she's really depressed. So, I made an appointment with the school counselor for her.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. The counselor is a psychologist. He's better trained to handle these sorts of things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, That's what I told her. I'm glad she's reaching out for help, Instead of trying to deal with this on her own.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Me too.
Speaker 1: Well. What's the climate like in your country?
Speaker 2: It's mild. But it's not always pleasant.
Speaker 1: Which season do you like best?
Speaker 2: I like spring. The days are long and the nights are short. The flowers in blew. We go on picnics.
Speaker 1: I would like to go skating. Feel like going with me?
Speaker 2: Is skating interesting?
Speaker 1: I think so. Fresh air, White snow. It's so comfortable.
Speaker 2: But I can't skate well.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter, I can teach you.
Speaker 2: It's very kind of you.
Speaker 1: Can you teach me?
Speaker 2: Sure. Take the tennis racket. Now, Throw the ball up, And hit it with the racket. Like this.
Speaker 1: Let me try. Oh, I missed!
Speaker 2: Throw the ball up high.
Speaker 1: High?
Speaker 2: Yes, Very high. Over your head. Then you will have time to hit the ball.
Speaker 1: Oh! I hit it.
Speaker 2: Well done!
Speaker 1: Thank you. I think I like playing it.
Speaker 1: I don't like them. I used to take them when I had to work overtime, You know.
Speaker 2: How many did you use to take?
Speaker 1: Three every night.
Speaker 1: No. Thank you. It looks a bit too dangerous for me.
Speaker 2: There is a beautiful state park here. I can see why so many people come out here to camp.
Speaker 1: Yes, There is beautiful view. You can go fishing, Camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air.
Speaker 2: It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 1: I think you'll like them. My family is pretty laid back.
Speaker 2: How Ay people will be there at dinner?
Speaker 1: Let's see. There's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters.
Speaker 2: That's good, I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families.
Speaker 1: Is it difficult to learn?
Speaker 2: Yes. The language is hard to learn, But it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about Britain and America?
Speaker 2: I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture.
Speaker 1: Right. It's important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well.
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: I didn't know your sister lives in the city, When did she move there?
Speaker 2: About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, Across from the public library.
Speaker 1: I see. It's almost 5:00 PM now, Don't you think there will be a lot of traffic?
Speaker 2: Oh, We're not driving. We're going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes.
Speaker 1: Yes, But it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.
Speaker 2: I take the subway to work everyday, So I'm used to it now.
Speaker 1: I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around.
Speaker 2: It was fun for me, Too. It gave me a chance to get away from my routine.
Speaker 1: You'll be out to see me next year, As you promised?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. I should be there some time next spring.
Speaker 1: I'll be expecting you then.
Speaker 1: I know. And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music.
Speaker 2: You're right! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike!
Speaker 1: Are you sure you're finished?
Speaker 2: I don't understand.
Speaker 1: You did a horrible job on my hair.
Speaker 2: What's wrong with it?
Speaker 1: I don't like anything about it.
Speaker 2: I apologize.
Speaker 1: That's fine, But I'm not paying for it.
Speaker 2: Excuse me? Let's try to work this out, Okay?
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: What about affirmative action? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy?
Speaker 1: Tiger Woods is about to tee off, And let's see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, He seems to be very nervous.
Speaker 2: Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It's definitely not his day today. On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.
Speaker 1: Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Speaker 2: Thanks a lot. I'll tell him.
Speaker 1: I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well.
Speaker 2: I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, But not so well in others.
Speaker 1: I think I could take better notes and read a little more.
Speaker 2: You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on.
Speaker 1: I'm working on it!
Speaker 2: Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement.
Speaker 1: Ok. Here is the money. And If I return the card, Can I get the refund?
Speaker 2: Of course, As long as the card is well kept.
Speaker 1: Ok. I see. Thank you.
Speaker 2: You are welcome.
Speaker 1: Will you get a pay-raise, Too?
Speaker 2: Whenever you are given added responsibilities, You should get a promotion.
Speaker 1: That makes sense. Who interviewed you?
Speaker 2: My boss.
Speaker 1: What kinds of questions did she ask you?
Speaker 2: She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be.
Speaker 1: What! That wasn't a foul! C 'mon, Ref!
Speaker 2: Don't worry, Shan always screws up free throws.
Speaker 1: You were right! He didn't make the shot!
Speaker 2: That was a great shot! A three pointer, Yeah!
Speaker 1: Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!
Speaker 2: This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, Open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!
Speaker 1: Okay... End of the first quarter... Alright, I'm gonna make a beer run.
Speaker 1: But they're just ads...
Speaker 2: Duh... That's the point. The people in the ads are wearing what's in. Plus, There are articles on new trends...
Speaker 1: Yes. I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves, All sorts of feelings welling up in my heart.
Speaker 2: That's true. Four years 'trails and hardships, Joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together. I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life.
Speaker 1: How time flies. Look, The president of the college has come onto the stage.
Speaker 2: He's going to make the opening speech.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Do you get a good knowledge of China?
Speaker 2: Yes, Whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most.
Speaker 1: All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall. And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World.
Speaker 1: I see. Which subject did you put last then?
Speaker 2: Oh. History.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. Could you give any reasons for your choice? Can you explainwhy do you put medicine first?
Speaker 2: Well, Doctors are such an important job. I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got, Isn't it? I want to be important and help people.
Speaker 1: Yes. I suppose so.
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.
Speaker 2: What time are you going?
Speaker 1: At 11:00 o'clock.
Speaker 2: I'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport.
Speaker 1: No, I'll go by myself, Thanks.
Speaker 2: Ok, Goodbye.
Speaker 1: They are attending an international conference here.
Speaker 2: Which hotel are they staying at?
Speaker 1: They are staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Speaker 1: You can be assured of it.
Speaker 1: Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, If you don't mind me saying so.
Speaker 2: It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, Visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.
Speaker 1: Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, How old are you?
Speaker 2: Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!
Speaker 1: Well, Easily, It doesn't work. It doesn't even start probably.
Speaker 2: Oh, Dear! I'll do well I can.
Speaker 1: No, I'll do it myself.
Speaker 2: Here is my card, Sir. Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you?
Speaker 1: I should think so, Too!
Speaker 2: I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble.
Speaker 1: Yes, And please be more careful in the future!
Speaker 2: I will, Sir. I'm really very sorry.
Speaker 1: That's OK.
Speaker 1: Well. Since you'd like an honest answer, I will tell you the truth.
Speaker 2: Alright. What is that you want to tell me?
Speaker 1: We'Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation!
Speaker 2: What? Are you serious? Oh, My gosh! There will be guys everywhere.
Speaker 1: Yep! And take it with me anywhere! And the music is free!
Speaker 2: Let me see it! It's so small!
Speaker 1: I'm watching you.
Speaker 2: I'm an open book. Watch me all you want.
Speaker 1: If I catch you, You'll be sorry.
Speaker 2: You won't catch me, Because I love you. I'm not a cheater.
Speaker 1: I will poke your eyes out.
Speaker 2: I don't want any other woman.
Speaker 1: I will chop your toes off, One by one.
Speaker 2: Honey, Please. You're the only woman for me, Forever. I swear it.
Speaker 1: I really hate receiving spam. I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway.
Speaker 2: Yes, That annoys me too. With billboards, You can look away, But with broadcasts, You can't avoid them. I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign.
Speaker 1: The more, The merrier!
Speaker 2: Will there be a lot of people there?
Speaker 1: I sure hope so. We've each invited about 10 people.
Speaker 2: Who else is going to be there?
Speaker 1: I'm inviting my friends from work, You, My sister, And a few friends from school.
Speaker 2: I know your sister. She's very nice.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. You won't be sitting there by yourself.
Speaker 1: It was many years ago, When I was a little child. It was the middle of the night, And I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen. I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, When...
Speaker 2: So that's where you saw the ghost? In your house? What did it look like? Was it hideous?
Speaker 1: It was a big, Green thing that looked like a person. It was in the kitchen, And it slowly moved towards the stairs...
Speaker 2: So what did you do?
Speaker 1: Yes, You must put yourself on a diet.
Speaker 1: Sure. If I could, I would eat hot pot every day!
Speaker 2: Ok, You are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food, Aren't you?
Speaker 1: Well, Let's stop dragging our feet and find aSichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner!
Speaker 2: Let me think about it for a minute. Let's see... Oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue! Give me a second and it'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Wow, This place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China.
Speaker 2: Yeah, A lot of changes have happened here.
Speaker 1: This street used to have few stores. But now, You can see supermarkets, Shopping malls and department stores everywhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah, They are my wife's heaven, But not mine. I always get lost in the supermarket.
Speaker 1: Me too! I was lost three times ten years ago. There were no English directions then.
Speaker 1: What school did you transfer from?
Speaker 2: I came here from PCC.
Speaker 1: Do you like it here so far?
Speaker 2: I am really enjoying it here so far.
Speaker 1: Which is better, Here or PCC?
Speaker 2: I think PCC is a lot better than here.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you just stay at PCC?
Speaker 2: I graduated and now want to get a BA.
Speaker 1: Yes, But there's a rush on at the moment, And my boss asked me to do some urgent letters.
Speaker 2: But didn't you tell him you had an appointment?
Speaker 1: Well, No. I thought I'd finish in about five minutes, And I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes. If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic, I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Well, You're here. And that's the main thing.
Speaker 1: You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor, And then make a decision.
Speaker 1: Then we'll have to put up with it.
Speaker 2: We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, They'll get drunk and fall asleep.
Speaker 1: That's without a doubt, The best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it!
Speaker 2: Run! They are thirsty for more!
Speaker 1: You're a good student. I'm sure you can do well. What you need to do is to relax.
Speaker 2: You're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time?
Speaker 1: Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress.
Speaker 2: I don't really have time to learn anything new. I need to spend my time studying!
Speaker 1: I'll say, She is really stacked, Isn't she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, She is a neck-off for sure.
Speaker 1: And he looks like a typical jog.
Speaker 2: He is a professional football player.
Speaker 1: What did you mean?
Speaker 2: I meant that they're very simple, Easy to talk to.
Speaker 1: Ouch. You must be very disappointed.
Speaker 2: Well, It's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have.
Speaker 1: Why don't youre-take the class next year?
Speaker 2: That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. How did you do this semester?
Speaker 1: I didn't do that well either. I ended up with a 3. 2 this semester. That drops my total GPA to 3. 45.
Speaker 2: My GPA is pretty similar to yours. I have a 3. 1 now because of the stupid econ class.
Speaker 1: What was your GPA before this semester?
Speaker 1: I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.
Speaker 2: I think you're right. Climate change naturally over time, But I think that human activities are speeding up the change. I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem.
Speaker 1: Me too. If we don't do something soon, It might be too late.
Speaker 1: I absolutely love it.
Speaker 2: You really like it?
Speaker 1: Yes, I truly do.
Speaker 2: I'm glad you like it.
Speaker 1: How much do I owe you?
Speaker 2: It's going to be $ 55.
Speaker 1: Here you go, Thanks for everything.
Speaker 2: Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: Well, Tell me. What are they like?
Speaker 2: They're nice.
Speaker 1: Nice. Hey, I like the layout of this page...
Speaker 2: You mean, You like the pictures of the beautiful models... Hello?
Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.
Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.
Speaker 1: How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet?
Speaker 2: Maybe it can take effect.
Speaker 1: Great, So what happens now?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to write the proposal. I'm pretty excited about it.
Speaker 1: Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge.
Speaker 2: It's not far away from home, It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk, Can you walk here?
Speaker 1: I've thought of that, But what can I do with my car? If only I had taken a taxi!
Speaker 2: That's too bad, But don't worry. We'll put off dinner till one o'clock.
Speaker 1: I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting.
Speaker 1: And what should I wear?
Speaker 2: Your usual shirt and shoes.
Speaker 1: What are you going to wear?
Speaker 2: Nothing unusual, I'm afraid.
Speaker 1: Sheila, How about that fashionable blue dress?
Speaker 2: Good. That's something unusual.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of movie do you like?
Speaker 2: Anything with a lot of action, I like thrillers and chillers.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoy the popcorn and being with you. You're more important than the movie.
Speaker 1: Well, Three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person.
Speaker 2: Wow, So you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work!
Speaker 1: I know. It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet. At our old department, It was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us.
Speaker 1: I have spoken my mind, And can go anywhere now.
Speaker 2: I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion.
Speaker 1: I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return.
Speaker 1: How could it be? They are due two weeks later.
Speaker 2: I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days.
Speaker 1: Kate, You know, I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more. But I'm so busy! How am I going to work and study? How do you do it? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time?
Speaker 2: To be honest with you, Jason, I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job. I'm always two steps behind. I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper. Say! Why don't you talk to your advisor? And let me know!
Speaker 1: My advisor?
Speaker 1: You could say so. I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise.
Speaker 2: It can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model.
Speaker 1: Yeah, The success stories of that company might be useful for me. And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company.
Speaker 2: That's right. You should establish good relationships with them. What else are you planning to do while working for that company?
Speaker 1: He got arrested all right.
Speaker 2: If I remember, He got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison.
Speaker 1: Yup, That's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.
Speaker 2: I think the government fined him a small amount, And he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire.
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail.
Speaker 1: Do you think that there's life on other planets?
Speaker 2: I think there must be.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world. The world is just far too big for that.
Speaker 1: Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us?
Speaker 2: No, But we're trying to contact them.
Speaker 1: Were I in your position, I'd go to America.
Speaker 2: Which university should I apply to?
Speaker 1: There are many universities for you to choose from. Some famous universities such as Harvard, Yale, The University of Michigan, And Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study, But they are very competitive and expensive. Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Who knows? You can't judge a book by its cover.
Speaker 2: Maybe!
Speaker 1: I have a headache. Is there anything I can buy without a prescription?
Speaker 2: Then you can buy Aspirin.
Speaker 1: I will take the Aspirin then. And have you a small first-aid kit?
Speaker 2: Yes, Here this is.
Speaker 1: I'll take it too.
Speaker 2: Thank you and take care.
Speaker 1: Well, What's the climate like in your country?
Speaker 2: It's mild, But it's not always pleasant.
Speaker 1: Which season do you like best?
Speaker 2: I like spring. The days are long and the night are short. The flowers are in bloom. We go on picnics.
Speaker 1: That sounds interesting!
Speaker 2: Yes, It's a great job. I love it. And what do you do?
Speaker 1: I'm a student, And I have a part-time job, Too.
Speaker 2: Oh? Where do you work?
Speaker 1: In a fast-food restaurant.
Speaker 2: Which restaurant?
Speaker 1: Hamburger Heaven.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But it's fun. Look at those two ugly old ladies... Or are they men?
Speaker 2: Hurry! Get a shot!... Hand it over!
Speaker 1: I knew you'd come around...
Speaker 1: That's really a shame. By the way, Who will be the bridesmaid?
Speaker 2: Julie's friend, Mary. And John will be the best man.
Speaker 1: Wow! I'm very excited about your ceremony.
Speaker 1: You are a thief?
Speaker 2: No, No. I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now. Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others 'vegetables.
Speaker 1: You mean it is a still virtual game. Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again, And you take theirs as well, Right?
Speaker 2: You got what I meant. Perhaps, What I steal are not vegetables, But loneliness.
Speaker 1: Don't be addicted to the game. It's not good for your job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, How about your maths teacher?
Speaker 2: He's an old antique, Very serious.
Speaker 1: Bad luck, Anne.
Speaker 2: Hey! How about your history teacher?
Speaker 1: She's another antique.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 1: I do wish your christmas and happy new year.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: I don't know. My friend told me it was a touching movie.
Speaker 1: I am not sure, Where exactly is it?
Speaker 2: Well, Not so far from New York. So what about you? Did you grow up here?
Speaker 1: No, I was born in Gaoxiong, I only moved to Taipei after I graduated.
Speaker 1: Oh, Don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long.
Speaker 2: That's right. We got the assignment last week.
Speaker 1: When is it due?
Speaker 2: Next Monday.
Speaker 1: Remind me never to sign up for that course.
Speaker 1: There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time, Don't you think?
Speaker 2: When you put it that way, I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever.
Speaker 1: This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken. I can't wait to use my new hoard.
Speaker 2: It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right.
Speaker 1: What do you think of the literature course.
Speaker 2: Its very helpful. The course has let me into a world of literature. I read so many great literatures.
Speaker 1: I must say I think that is very odd. Are you absolutely certain it was her?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, I am sure.
Speaker 1: Because I don't want any, Er, Do you understand? But you are quite sure, Are you?
Speaker 2: Quite sure. I mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers.
Speaker 1: That's right. For seventy-five million. So how are you?
Speaker 2: I'm getting by OK. I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division.
Speaker 1: So why not come and join us? Lee will come as well.
Speaker 2: That's great. I will go hiking with you.
Speaker 1: Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can do that this afternoon.
Speaker 1: Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations. Doesn't that seem logical?
Speaker 2: Yes, Let me put it on the calendar.
Speaker 1: What kind of course are you looking for?
Speaker 2: I need to improve my English.
Speaker 1: Do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class?
Speaker 2: I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me, So a group class would be fine.
Speaker 1: Have you ever considered taking one of our online courses?
Speaker 2: I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better.
Speaker 1: Believe it or not, I guess American women like a man in good shape, Which Chinese women may not care about so much. That's my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.
Speaker 2: American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, There aren't many chances.
Speaker 1: No, That's not true. I'Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese. But those Chinese look very strong and healthy. So if you exercise more often, I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls. How old is Jacky Chan? He's small and short. But I bet he can have any American woman he wants.
Speaker 1: Okay, But I haven't prepare supper.
Speaker 2: So let's eat out.
Speaker 1: What do you want to eat?
Speaker 2: Noodles. How about you?
Speaker 1: Dumplings.
Speaker 1: Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos. He's called 'Beast'?
Speaker 2: How could you know?
Speaker 1: I watched the screen display!
Speaker 2: Do you know 'He' is Ms. Rebecca!
Speaker 1: It's typical Net Love, And a typical lesbians 'homosex! Ha!
Speaker 2: Impossible!
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know. It depends.
Speaker 1: I don't believe that.
Speaker 2: And in my opinion, Medicine is making us healthier.
Speaker 1: I agree with you in the sense. But we're all more miserable than ever, Aren't we?
Speaker 2: I don't agree with you. I maintain that we're healthier, Wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago.
Speaker 1: That's your opinion not mine.
Speaker 1: Yes, Now many girls want to be independent, So it is a little popular, Especially among white collars.
Speaker 2: But I am still traditional, So I felt weird when she paid for herself.
Speaker 1: Forget about it!
Speaker 2: Are you satisfied with your girlfriend?
Speaker 1: It will be a long story. We have many differences, For example, She usually puts all her clothes into washing machine. That is the sort of thing I can not bear.
Speaker 1: I'd like to wish you every success in your new venture.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I wish I would.
Speaker 1: Good luck to you.
Speaker 1: In the kitchen, With his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show.
Speaker 2: What does he do there?
Speaker 1: Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward. Picture a man making a stir-fry, Tossing the mixture up in the air, And then catching it, Every last bit, In his work. And his culinary motto is 'Enjoy the moment.' If you want to know hey theycook, Visit www. StudioClassroom. Com. Tw for the recipe.
Speaker 1: Okay. But you have to admit that it was an exciting story, Especially with that surprise ending.
Speaker 2: You should read the book. The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end.
Speaker 1: Oh, Really? How does the book end?
Speaker 1: Have people set foot on its peak?
Speaker 2: Yes, It has been conquered by many people in history.
Speaker 1: Well, A good teacher makes good students.
Speaker 2: You are quite right.
Speaker 1: You really think we can make it? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again. We're no match for them, The competition will beat us hands down.
Speaker 1: You know, Speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use.
Speaker 1: Is it important?
Speaker 2: Yes. Do you mind?
Speaker 1: You really have to?
Speaker 2: Yes. Will you let me?
Speaker 1: I guess so.
Speaker 1: Yes, Sir. What time would you like your table, Sir?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, Perhaps around 8 pm.
Speaker 1: Fine! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm, Sir. May I have your name, Please?
Speaker 2: Davis.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Davis.
Speaker 2: Oh, Any chance of a table by the window? My wife loves the bird's eye view. As it's her birthday, I want it to be a celebration.
Speaker 1: I see. We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything, Please be assured that we'll try our best, Mr. Davis. I hope you'll understand.
Speaker 2: I do, But I would appreciate you, If it could be arranged.
Speaker 1: I just can't help it. Oh, Look at Clive, He is really a big hit. They are definitely gonna win.
Speaker 2: It's only seven minutes into the game, Too early to cheer up.
Speaker 1: Come on, 18 points already, They are never gonna catch up.
Speaker 2: Who knows! It's a long game. Look! That was a really nice shot!
Speaker 1: Thay are coming back to narrow the gap.
Speaker 1: What are spring and autumn like?
Speaker 2: I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, The weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, Sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny and dry, But it's gradually gets colder as winter arrives. What are the seasons like in you city?
Speaker 1: Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, So our summertime is your wintertime, And vice versa. We get some rain in every season, But most is in winter. In winter, It sometimes gets cold, But our winters are usually quite mild. Summers are warm, But not hot. Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each. The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city.
Speaker 2: Do you usually go on a summer holiday?
Speaker 1: So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents.
Speaker 2: Maybe when they become teenagers, They want to be completely different to their parents.
Speaker 1: You might be right. I guess most parents want their kids to be like them, But kids today grow up in a different environment. You know, They know much more about the world from the internet, Newspapers, And tv.
Speaker 2: Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies?
Speaker 1: Art isn't for everyone. I'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery. It's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture.
Speaker 2: I like sculpture, Especially that form ancient rome or Greece. What time are you thinking of going? I'd love to go with you.
Speaker 1: I thought I'd have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards. Does that sound ok to you? Bus 51 goes directly there.
Speaker 1: Ok, Well, We're going to make a pan of lasagne, A salad, And some garlic bread. Here's the recipe. Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard?
Speaker 2: Sure. We should probably pre-heat the oven right away, Too.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius?
Speaker 1: My wife and I will look forward to it.
Speaker 2: I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit. Oh, What's your flight number?
Speaker 1: Lt's Flight No. 302, Northwest Orient Airlines.
Speaker 2: They just announced the boarding call.
Speaker 1: Then we've got to get going.
Speaker 1: I can understand. By the way, Is there anyway I can help?
Speaker 2: No, Not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's so great, Bless you! If you need me, I'll always be there.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: It seems you have late fees.
Speaker 2: Are you sure?
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: How much?
Speaker 1: Your late fees come to $ 24. 50.
Speaker 2: I don't have that right now.
Speaker 1: You have to pay it off before you can check out more books.
Speaker 2: I'll do that soon.
Speaker 1: I'm hungry. I'd like to eat something.
Speaker 2: Where do you want to go?
Speaker 1: I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant.
Speaker 2: What kind of Italian food do you like?
Speaker 1: I like spaghetti. Do you like spaghetti?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, But I like pizza.
Speaker 1: The couple with the dogs-think back.
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall a thing about them.
Speaker 1: Well, I've invited them for brunch.
Speaker 2: Hmm, I must be getting absent-minded.
Speaker 1: Sounds hard.
Speaker 2: Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.
Speaker 1: Won't you get lonely?
Speaker 2: Hey, I'm a pretty cool guy ; I'll make friends. And I'll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too. You know, Like fencing or theater or something.
Speaker 1: No, I don't like museums. They're boring.
Speaker 2: Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building?
Speaker 1: Ah! That sounds interesting.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'll sing San Francisco then.
Speaker 1: Coffee, Please.
Speaker 2: Here you are.
Speaker 1: Would you like to talk over a drink?
Speaker 2: That sounds good. How are you doing, Linda?
Speaker 1: Just fine. Are you busy now?
Speaker 2: No. I'm just killing time.
Speaker 1: Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Yes. I haven't been in his house for several weeks. When shall we start?
Speaker 1: Sounds cool! But that is not what a lady should do. People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk.
Speaker 1: Yes, I did. He only takes side with him. He seldom asks what Dick is doing.
Speaker 1: You honestly have no idea?
Speaker 2: PCC is perfectly fine for me.
Speaker 1: You might as well stay here.
Speaker 2: That's not a bad idea.
Speaker 1: PCC is a wonderful institution.
Speaker 2: You have a point.
Speaker 1: So, What are you going to do?
Speaker 2: I'm just going to keep going to PCC.
Speaker 1: You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: Yes, I am.
Speaker 2: Why don't you run off with him? What are you waiting for?
Speaker 1: I don't actually know him.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: I only know him through the... You are not gonna believe this.
Speaker 2: Oh, Let me guess. Through the internet?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Hmm. You'Ve got mail.
Speaker 1: Oh, How wonderful! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys.
Speaker 2: I'll surely make introductions for them.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your compliment. Won't you try this fish with white sauce? I'm rather round of it.
Speaker 2: It's delicious.
Speaker 1: What sort of western food do you like best?
Speaker 2: I like beefsteak very much. Have you tried Chinese dishes?
Speaker 1: I find the Chinese dishes wonderful.
Speaker 1: Sure. Oh, That reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?
Speaker 2: My boots? Er... Sure, Ok.
Speaker 1: Thanks. My name's Bill Peters, By the way.
Speaker 2: Hi, I'm Susan Jackson.
Speaker 1: Nice to meet you. And what do you do, Susan?
Speaker 2: I'm a student at UCLA.
Speaker 1: Oh, Are you? And what are you studying?
Speaker 2: Medicine.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes, I want to be a doctor one of these days. What about you?
Speaker 1: I'm an engineer, I work for Boeing. Say, Would you like a drink?
Speaker 2: Sure. Thanks.
Speaker 1: I couldn't even if I wanted to. My parents told me that if I went home, Then I'd have to find my own place.
Speaker 2: You mean they're kicking you out?
Speaker 1: Not really, They just don't want me living at home. My older sister did that, And she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, It got harder and harder for her to move out.
Speaker 2: Well, It's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with, But they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so.
Speaker 1: My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well, And because of that, They want me to be more independent. They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own.
Speaker 1: Hmm. I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday. I've got to fly to Chicago on business.
Speaker 2: Well unfortunately, I'm tied up on Tuesday. I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town, And I don't think there's any way I can get out of it. Are you free on Wednesday?
Speaker 1: Wednesday? Let me see. Hmm. Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday. Oh, Yes! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned, And it's essential that I keep it.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm afraid Thursday is out for me. I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee, And it's very important for me to be there.
Speaker 1: What for?
Speaker 2: The job market is so competitive nowadays. I want to develop some useful skills.
Speaker 1: I really admire you for that. How is it going?
Speaker 2: It's going all right. I'm learning some things for the first time, But I'm also brushing up on some things that I already know.
Speaker 1: Oh, It's so. She looks very lovely. Could you give me some else information on her?
Speaker 2: Ok. She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill.
Speaker 1: How do you think about her?
Speaker 2: She looks very beautiful. She is a nice girl.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering if she has boyfriend.
Speaker 2: No, She hasn't.
Speaker 1: Great! Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: You can apply right now.
Speaker 2: I'd like to do that.
Speaker 1: Fill this out, Please.
Speaker 2: What's next?
Speaker 1: I will need to take your passport picture.
Speaker 2: When will my passport be ready?
Speaker 1: It will take about three weeks.
Speaker 2: That's great. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Mr. : For those of you who don't have a calculator, Get one.
Speaker 2: We are allowed to use a calculator in class?
Speaker 1: Mr. : Yes. By the way, Review today's notes this evening. We may have a small quiz tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I agree. It makes you feel really good.
Speaker 2: What are those?
Speaker 1: Do you mean the red things? They are roses.
Speaker 2: I'm going to take more pictures today.
Speaker 1: Me, Too.
Speaker 1: You're right. Life isn't always like the movies.
Speaker 1: Yes. Here's my identification.
Speaker 2: That's all you need.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. By the way, How many books am I allowed to check out?
Speaker 2: You can check out two books at a time. But you can't check out newspapers, Magazines and periodicals, They have to be read within library.
Speaker 1: How long can I keep the books?
Speaker 2: For two weeks. After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer.
Speaker 1: Maybe he shouldn't come to collage, He should become a football star.
Speaker 1: A highchair and car seat! Wow Betty, Thank you so much! I really appreciate it!
Speaker 2: One more from Carla.
Speaker 1: A playpen and crib! Thanks Carla! This is just what I needed!
Speaker 1: I know you're right, But what can I do?
Speaker 2: How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night?
Speaker 1: But I'll miss the news. It's important in my business to keep up with events in China.
Speaker 1: I don't like this program, Because there are too many constant arguments between the judges.
Speaker 2: The contestants are different. These girls perform in free styles.
Speaker 1: Do you have much time watching TV?
Speaker 2: I think less than 3 hours. This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs. Too many ads between the programs. I prefer listening to the radio.
Speaker 1: I don't like ads, Either. But ads could bring big profits to the TV station.
Speaker 1: Ok. Here you are. Anybody who wants help, Please come to me.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, Mr Addison.
Speaker 1: It is great. But Tom's bike is so much better than mine.
Speaker 2: Frankly, He is more well-behaved than you.
Speaker 1: Nothing of that sort!
Speaker 2: Why hasn't the bus come yet? Every morning we have to wait for so long.
Speaker 1: Mom, It's OK. I will buy a big car one day. It is faster than the bus.
Speaker 2: Really? I am looking forward to that. What about the traffic?
Speaker 1: Let me see. Yes. I will buy a plane for you. There is no traffic up there.
Speaker 1: That sounds good. Where do you want to play?
Speaker 2: We won't have much time, So let's play somewhere close to work.
Speaker 1: How about Bellevue? It's pretty close.
Speaker 2: How much does it cost over there?
Speaker 1: Twilight rates are 21 dollars.
Speaker 2: That's pretty good. Let's do it.
Speaker 1: Aright. I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality.
Speaker 2: Thanks for coming.
Speaker 1: How about next time we meet at my place? And I'll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise.
Speaker 2: Great idea. I'm looking forward to it. See you then.
Speaker 1: Well. I really do have to go.
Speaker 1: It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned?
Speaker 2: You're right, But when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering.
Speaker 1: What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue?
Speaker 2: Quite a number. Actually every skyscraper has a history. A few blocks ahead we'll see St. Patrick's Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center. It's a landmark.
Speaker 1: What's there after that?
Speaker 1: Good! Me too! By the way. You didn't tell me what you are studying here.
Speaker 2: Didn't I? I'm doing business studies.
Speaker 1: Really? That's great. You hope to join a company after graduating?
Speaker 2: Maybe. My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born. We are living in Toronto. Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate. It's too soon to say really.
Speaker 1: What about your friend Zoe.
Speaker 2: She's from Australia. She lives in Sydney. Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy.
Speaker 1: The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group.
Speaker 2: I think I'm going to decline. I just prefer to do my own thing.
Speaker 1: Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school?
Speaker 2: My dad was, But not my mom.
Speaker 1: Is it difficult to learn?
Speaker 2: Yes. The language is hard to learn, But it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about Britain and America?
Speaker 2: I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture.
Speaker 1: Right. It's important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well.
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: That's great. When are you starting?
Speaker 2: Probably in a week or two. I'll let you know.
Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?
Speaker 2: Yes, Please. Thank you for everything.
Speaker 1: Email is not always the best form. I think QQ is way better.
Speaker 2: Your words sound a bit reasonable. But don't forget the time difference.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 1: It's a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks. You should stick with one for the whole evening.
Speaker 2: I know, But it was a celebration, You Kwon? I don't think I'Ve see you drunk.
Speaker 1: I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints.
Speaker 2: You are a sensible drinker. Anyway, I'm not going to drink any alcohol this evening. I don't 'want another bad hangover.
Speaker 1: I want to study abroad.
Speaker 2: What do you want to study?
Speaker 1: I hope to study English literature.
Speaker 2: Have you got your visa yet?
Speaker 1: Not yet. I have an interview with the visa official today.
Speaker 2: I see. Is it your first interview?
Speaker 1: No, I've already been to here for three interviews.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: I was denied a visa?
Speaker 1: Yeah! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth?
Speaker 1: Is she as clever as you?
Speaker 2: No, She's not as clever as me.
Speaker 1: Big head!
Speaker 1: By the way, Could you tell me when the film will begin?
Speaker 2: It will begin at five thirty.
Speaker 1: I am frigid I can't be there on time.
Speaker 2: You can see it tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I don't want to miss it today.
Speaker 2: See you.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: I'Ve been thinking, And well, I think we need to start seeing other people.
Speaker 2: What? Why? I mean, We'Ve had our ups and downs, And we have the occasional disagreement, But we're happy together, Aren't we?
Speaker 1: That's just it, I'm not happy anymore, Tim. It's not you, It's me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, And you are a great guy! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for!
Speaker 2: So, What are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?
Speaker 1: Tim, You are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need, But that would be a lie. I know I'd only hurt you, I know I'd only make you cry.
Speaker 1: Well, It was all a big mistake, Actually. He got home on Friday night really late, And apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients, So he was really drunk.
Speaker 2: Was he out with the guys from the bank?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah, They always get really drunk.
Speaker 1: Well, Anyway, He'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys, So he couldn't get in. He lives alone, You know.
Speaker 2: Oh, Really. I thought he lived with his wife.
Speaker 1: What's the puzzle?
Speaker 2: My husband and I prefer to have no kids, But my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way.
Speaker 2: Yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night.
Speaker 1: Oh, Really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.
Speaker 2: But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not.
Speaker 1: I see. I'm sure you'll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.
Speaker 2: Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday.
Speaker 1: Are you a member of his fan club?
Speaker 2: I was, But then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, So I'm not a member now.
Speaker 1: Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage, But the don't do that at “ ginger's ”. What was included in the seafood buffet?
Speaker 2: They had almost every kind of seafood. There were oyster, Shrimp, Prawns, Crabs, And fish. I ate a lot of smoked salmon.
Speaker 1: Yeah, That makes sense.
Speaker 1: Don't you worry, I'll take care of everything! Oh my god! I just love your curly hair! It's so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!
Speaker 2: Um... No.
Speaker 1: Okay, But you are going to be my masterpiece!
Speaker 1: I do, That's why you should appreciate this gift!
Speaker 2: Sure. That's really nice of you. Let's go in and try some things on.
Speaker 1: How about this red dress? I think it would really suit you.
Speaker 2: That's gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8?
Speaker 1: Really? I'm surprised.
Speaker 2: Me too.
Speaker 1: I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.
Speaker 2: I think you're right. Climate change naturally over time, But I think that human activities are speeding up the change. I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem.
Speaker 1: Me too. If we don't do something soon, It might be too late.
Speaker 1: Come on, You don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity.
Speaker 2: Mary, It's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun.
Speaker 1: How? By drinking?
Speaker 2: Drinking is just part of it. I mean, You have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, The more you talk. It makes me so relaxed.
Speaker 1: Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.
Speaker 2: I heard they were just married for 5 months.
Speaker 1: Yes, She said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden.
Speaker 1: You said it. You know, They fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.
Speaker 2: Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.
Speaker 1: Yeah. We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners.
Speaker 1: Ah, Yes. The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body.
Speaker 2: Don't we all... Hey! Your cousin sells gift items?
Speaker 1: Yeah-all from Italy. See all the saints? They're important to Roman Catholics.
Speaker 1: I'm serious.
Speaker 2: Alright. Next time, We can try some other flavors.
Speaker 1: Certainly. The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good. It must be very delicious.
Speaker 2: Definitely. I really like Italian food.
Speaker 1: Isn't there anything else?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: You must have a high IQ score.
Speaker 2: Well, Jerry, Let me tell you a secret.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: My IQ score is slightly above average.
Speaker 1: Seriously? But you are such a genius.
Speaker 2: Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, Perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ.
Speaker 1: If you want to be macho, Order a double shot of espresso.
Speaker 2: Now you're talking. That sounds good. What is it?
Speaker 1: Who has a crush?!
Speaker 2: Come on, Ted, Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out.
Speaker 2: What're you so afraid of? Just tell her what you're feeling about her.
Speaker 1: I'd totally die if she turned me down.
Speaker 2: But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You've got to let her know. Come on! You've got to take a chance! Even though you are rejected, It's not the end of the world! There's nothing to lose, Is there?
Speaker 1: No, We walked. Why, Do you need us to carry some stuff home later?
Speaker 2: No, It's just that it's a holiday. With everyone out partying, There's a lot of drunk driving.
Speaker 1: Are you doing anything tomorrow?
Speaker 2: I'm free tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock, Will it do?
Speaker 2: All right, See you then.
Speaker 1: Would you be interested in joining me?
Speaker 2: Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving?
Speaker 1: I thought that we could leave around 8.
Speaker 2: That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara?
Speaker 1: That was part of my plan.
Speaker 2: Well then, I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks for asking me to go with you.
Speaker 1: It is real word.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Are you having a big wedding?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've always dream of having a big wedding.
Speaker 1: But what do you say about that?
Speaker 2: I don't really enjoy big occasions, But I think I'll come round to the idea in the end, It only happens once in a lifetime.
Speaker 1: Perhaps I'll agree with Mike. I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before.
Speaker 1: She is tall?
Speaker 2: Yes, She is.
Speaker 1: And she is thin, Isn't she?
Speaker 2: Well, Just a little thin.
Speaker 1: You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: That certainly sounds like adreary Saturday.
Speaker 2: It gets better on Sunday, Though. The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night. It will still be rather cool, With highs in the low 50s. The West Coast will be experiencing some.
Speaker 1: I thought it was pretty good.
Speaker 2: Really? I can't say I agree.
Speaker 1: You're kidding. The story and acting were outstanding.
Speaker 2: I guess I expected too much from the movie, So I was a bit disappointed.
Speaker 1: I guess it could happen.
Speaker 1: Sorry. This is a one-man job. I've got the grill just how I like it, And I've made up my own special sauce.
Speaker 2: Then I'll tell folks the food's ready. Come and get it! I've always wanted to say that!
Speaker 1: What am I going to do?
Speaker 2: Let's go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you.
Speaker 1: You have made a big progress. Quitting smoking is not an easy job. But it will be rewarding in the long run.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your suggestion.
Speaker 1: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: You're right. By the way, Did you hear that tom inherited some money recently?
Speaker 2: Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago.
Speaker 1: They did. He inherited the money form an uncle. I hope he doesn't lose a lot of it in taxed to the government.
Speaker 1: Can't you hang out with them, Too?
Speaker 2: I could, But all they ever talk about is work, So I always end up feeling left out.
Speaker 1: Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, So it's just the two of you.
Speaker 2: I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you answer my question?
Speaker 2: What question?
Speaker 1: Do you love me? Come on, I'm eager to hear.
Speaker 2: You know that I care for you. I .. I'm proud of you.
Speaker 1: Don't cherish your words, Dear.
Speaker 2: I .. I don't feel like saying it.
Speaker 1: We do charge to use the machine.
Speaker 2: How much does it cost?
Speaker 1: We charge ten cents a copy.
Speaker 2: How many copies am I allowed to make?
Speaker 1: There is no limit to how many copies you can make.
Speaker 2: Would you mind showing me how to use it?
Speaker 1: Please read the instructions on the copier.
Speaker 2: Oh, Okay. Thanks.
Speaker 1: Ok. Don't let it get to you. Goodbye.
Speaker 1: What have you been doing for the past two years?
Speaker 2: I have been going to graduate school at USC.
Speaker 1: What are you majoring in?
Speaker 2: I am studying international communications.
Speaker 1: You should easily be able to find a job with that major.
Speaker 2: I am counting on being able to get a good job.
Speaker 1: Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.
Speaker 1: Smaller local companies. We specialize in trade & shipping industry.
Speaker 2: I used to work for a shipping company for six years, And I am quite familiar with some managers. Would your like to meet them?
Speaker 1: Guangzhou. I've got a cousin there.
Speaker 1: I'm a new student in the school. My name's John.
Speaker 2: Nice to meet you, John.
Speaker 1: It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Green.
Speaker 1: I thought the special effects were amazing, But I got a bit confused. The plot was too complicated for me.
Speaker 2: Did you read the books before you watched the movies?
Speaker 1: No. Did you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've read them many times. I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters.
Speaker 1: Yes, Trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me.
Speaker 1: Sure, I think I know the place.
Speaker 2: Well, Anyway, I made a beeline over to their office, Had an interview with the manager, And was told to start work the next day.
Speaker 1: That's really great, Jill. So, What do you do there exactly?
Speaker 2: Right now I'm basically just a secretary, But if I'm given the chance, I want to become a travel agent there.
Speaker 1: Ok. Boy, This looks expensive.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It costed a bundle, Alright?
Speaker 1: Wow, This thing can haul.
Speaker 2: Yeah, This sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned.
Speaker 1: I believe it. Hoo, This car corners like it's on rails.
Speaker 2: We are on the high way. Find the pound shade ...
Speaker 1: Wow, This car can really burn rubber.
Speaker 2: It's a great feeling.
Speaker 1: Oh, Just for a position as a gas station attendant. You know, Starting at a simple lowly job, Just like all the greats before they made it big in the world.
Speaker 1: How awful! Was he hurt?
Speaker 2: Yes. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
Speaker 1: How did it happen?
Speaker 2: His car was hit by an express train. It happened at the crossing just behind his house.
Speaker 1: How horrible!
Speaker 2: He's having an operation in the hospital now. Poor Hilda! You can imagine how unhappy she is.
Speaker 1: I hope he'll be all right.
Speaker 2: I hope so, Too.
Speaker 1: Heads.
Speaker 2: Sorry, It's tails. You lose.
Speaker 1: Oh, Well. So you get the bottom bunk. What about our stereos? It looks like we both brought our stereos. Probably we only have room for one.
Speaker 2: Your stereo is better than mine. Do you mind if we use yours?
Speaker 1: No, I don't mind. I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room.
Speaker 2: Probably we can put one on that counter. And we can put one on the floor by the bed. Over there.
Speaker 1: Addiction? Checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? No way!
Speaker 2: Yes, It is. Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And do you like English food?
Speaker 2: Not all of it.
Speaker 1: I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.
Speaker 2: You see, That's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.
Speaker 1: Mr. : Why don't you sit behind Brad?
Speaker 2: Who's Brad?
Speaker 1: Mr. : He's that guy in the blue shirt.
Speaker 2: When does the first period begin, By the way?
Speaker 1: Mr. : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement.
Speaker 1: Certainly. Mr. Lee's office building at the south end of the campus, Just beside the library.
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Let me show you the way. Please follow me.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much. It's very kind of you.
Speaker 1: My pleasure.
Speaker 2: This is it?
Speaker 1: No, I don't often dance. Isn't this a wonderful party?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm glad I have come.
Speaker 1: How do you like fox-trot?
Speaker 2: I like it very much.
Speaker 1: You dance beautifully.
Speaker 2: Thank you. It's lucky that I have got a good partner.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Good idea. We should also pedicures and manicures.
Speaker 2: This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour!
Speaker 1: I think it's a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally. Don't you agree?
Speaker 2: Oh, I agree. We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress.
Speaker 1: Maybe we should try a thai massage too.
Speaker 1: Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.
Speaker 2: Well, It looks very nice.
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 1: Pop. It's Maria Carey.
Speaker 2: When is it?
Speaker 1: At 8PM tomorrow night.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd like to go. Do you think we should have dinner first?
Speaker 1: Yes, That's a good idea.
Speaker 2: Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment.
Speaker 1: Oh, I think I know the place you mean. We ate there last month, Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's right. You have a good memory.
Speaker 1: You can put stuff on the picnic table. Back to work. The grill is calling me...
Speaker 2: Let me know if I can help.
Speaker 1: Sure! Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.
Speaker 2: Okay. That'll be 80 bucks.
Speaker 1: Wait... What!
Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I'Ve decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, It's just that I'Ve been smoking since I was sixteen, And I think it's time to stop.
Speaker 2: I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing?
Speaker 1: One last thing, I'Ve decided to come out of the closet.
Speaker 1: It is in the DX community, Room 306, No. 2 building. It is very easy to find. Just ask the guard at the entrance.
Speaker 2: Who else will come?
Speaker 1: I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor, Paul. He is a very good person. You should meet him.
Speaker 1: Ten.
Speaker 2: Western food or Chinese food?
Speaker 1: Chinese food.
Speaker 2: Do you want an expensive meal?
Speaker 1: No, Not too lavish.
Speaker 2: How much would you like to spend for each person?
Speaker 1: What is the usual thing here?
Speaker 2: Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate.
Speaker 1: Let's say sixty Yuan then.
Speaker 2: Ok. Is there anything special you'd like to have on the menu?
Speaker 1: We'd like to have typical Chinese food.
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 2: And Roman really loves life. He knows how to enjoy himself.
Speaker 1: Not always. But they like good meal.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: How can I go there to have a taste?
Speaker 2: By air of course.
Speaker 1: Who has a crush?
Speaker 2: Come on, Josh, Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.
Speaker 1: I'd totally die if she turned me down.
Speaker 2: You've got to let her know. Come on! You've got to take a chance!
Speaker 1: Is it really worth paying for?
Speaker 2: I can't tell yet. I haven't got beyond the first chapter.
Speaker 1: If it's any good, I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition.
Speaker 1: Darned right I would!
Speaker 2: Maybe make-up would be enough?
Speaker 1: Come on, Liz. Be open-minded! Look at my eyes, They are puffy. And my eye bags, They are dark and loose and full of lines and circles. I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings.
Speaker 2: But what would other people think?
Speaker 1: I don't care what other people think. I am ready for a lift.
Speaker 1: I agree with you, But you know how old-fashioned the elders are.
Speaker 1: I didn't mean to. Things just kept taking up all of my time.
Speaker 2: Maybe you got your plate too full this semester? You can change that next semester.
Speaker 1: I think I'd better. I have twenty four credits this time around. That might be a bit much.
Speaker 2: I'll say. The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself.
Speaker 1: Yes. I love facing danger and overcoming it. It has become part of my life.
Speaker 1: Oh, God, Please tell me how.
Speaker 2: I can't tell you.
Speaker 1: Ok, I want you to be happy when we are together, And when you are sad, I would always stay with you.
Speaker 2: When I am angry and want to beat someone, You stand there and let me do what I want. Would you?
Speaker 1: Yes, I would. Thanks for being in my life.
Speaker 2: Don't be so happy, It is just one of my tests!
Speaker 1: Yeah, But he really puts blame on me.
Speaker 1: I think they're playing Lord of the Rings.
Speaker 2: That sounds pretty good. Let's watch that.
Speaker 1: Where should we meet?
Speaker 2: How about at the subway entrance.
Speaker 1: Aright. I'll meet you there at one o'clock.
Speaker 1: Sure. Bring enough films, Please.
Speaker 2: I sure will.
Speaker 1: Yeah but, He is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, He always shuts down and brushes me off.
Speaker 2: Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, Anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.
Speaker 1: I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know...
Speaker 1: Please use the phone.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: Is he getting better now?
Speaker 2: I think so. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Are you available on Sunday?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's my only day off until Thursday.
Speaker 1: Ok, Well, My friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday. We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere, So you could still sleep in. Do you want to come with us?
Speaker 2: That'd be fantastic! Which beach are you going to?
Speaker 1: It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city.
Speaker 1: I don't know. It looks a little wrong down.
Speaker 2: This is right. There is no doubt in my mind.
Speaker 1: You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here?
Speaker 2: Check and double check.
Speaker 1: When could we get together?
Speaker 2: I could easily give you some time tomorrow night.
Speaker 1: Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door?
Speaker 2: Yes, And could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?
Speaker 1: I'll come prepared.
Speaker 2: Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet.
Speaker 1: But you taught children, Yes?
Speaker 2: Yes. That's right. But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America. At least as far as studying is concerned. Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school.
Speaker 1: They actually study after school?
Speaker 2: That's right. After their school day is over, They go to a special institute to study math or English. They are very serious about learning over there.
Speaker 1: Port, Please.
Speaker 2: Excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor.
Speaker 1: The port is exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right?
Speaker 2: Yes. You always have a good nose for wines.
Speaker 1: Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.
Speaker 2: Oh, What's that?
Speaker 1: I say we get drunk tonight. I don't want to think about all this stuff.
Speaker 2: But we have to work tomorrow.
Speaker 1: We won't stay out too late. I just need to forget about work.
Speaker 2: I hear ya. Let's do it.
Speaker 1: My wife will be going back to work soon.
Speaker 2: You should have more money then.
Speaker 1: Yes. We will need milk powder and bassinet.
Speaker 1: Here we go. There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art. ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art. ).
Speaker 2: Wow. Look at this. So delicate and beautiful. Did ancient Chinese people really wear them?
Speaker 1: Not really. They are just opera costumes. Do you like the embroidery?
Speaker 2: I surely do. They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that.
Speaker 1: Really? You're an amazing bargain hunter! Next time there's a sale, Promise you'll let me tag along with you.
Speaker 2: It's a promise.
Speaker 1: Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures?
Speaker 2: Sure, We wouldn't miss that for anything. After that, We took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, So we got there in less than an hour.
Speaker 1: You were lucky then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, We spent the whole morning under the tall trees. We had our picnic there, Too.
Speaker 1: What did you do after that?
Speaker 2: We went for a swim in the sea. That was the biggest part of the day. Just look at my nice tan!
Speaker 1: No, I don't know where the bookstore is.
Speaker 2: Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?
Speaker 1: Really? How can I do that?
Speaker 2: Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?
Speaker 1: No, I can't make it today.
Speaker 2: I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1.
Speaker 1: January 5th.
Speaker 2: Let's see... You're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, But you could see new, Exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting summers!
Speaker 1: I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system.
Speaker 2: I bet nobody will care about it.
Speaker 1: You too. Bye.
Speaker 1: It's too late to say sorry now. Oh, What am I going to do?
Speaker 2: I know I was an idiot, But if there is anything I can do to make up, Please do tell me.
Speaker 1: What did your boss say?
Speaker 2: He told me that if I showed up late one more time, He'd fire me. He's so mean!
Speaker 1: That's horrible. Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work?
Speaker 2: That was my second time. The first time, I was in a car accident.
Speaker 1: Is your boss Chinese?
Speaker 2: No, He's from Australia. Before I met him, I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going. I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know. Sometimes I have the same feeling with you. But you'd better not be so emotional.
Speaker 2: Can you stay and accompany me for a while?
Speaker 1: Sure, No problem. You can call me any time you are alone from now on.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much. You are so sweet.
Speaker 1: Not at all. We are friends.
Speaker 1: Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, But compared to many countries in other continents, It's not very l.
Speaker 2: Britain is half the size of france, But great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world.
Speaker 1: The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used. Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest.
Speaker 1: No, Once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice. The cooler, The better.
Speaker 2: I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea. It's appetizing and tasty.
Speaker 1: Well, If you say so. Personally speaking, I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne.
Speaker 1: Not bad. I finally bought a house. It's an old one, But built really solid. It is close to here. Do you want to come over for lunch?
Speaker 2: I'd like that, But I'm flying home this afternoon, And I told my parents I'd meet them at the airport for lunch.
Speaker 1: Ok, Next time you're here.
Speaker 2: That's a deal.
Speaker 1: Well, Did you know he was also the director of The Terminator?
Speaker 2: Well, Nobody's perfect!
Speaker 1: Well, Generally in the U.S. Each university has its own outstanding fields. But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th.
Speaker 2: Oh, No. It's already February 5th.
Speaker 1: So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year.
Speaker 2: I will think about it.
Speaker 1: I don't want to be like this. I think we should get step further.
Speaker 2: It has only been 6 months, Our relationship hasn't had a chance tomaturate. We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek.
Speaker 1: I know. Our train system is lousy. And besides, Americans love their cars too much.
Speaker 2: I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful. They never allowed the government to develop trains.
Speaker 1: It's too bad for the environment. So much pollution from cars.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day.
Speaker 1: What about the weather in Boston?
Speaker 2: I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter.
Speaker 1: Is it very cold in winter?
Speaker 2: Yes, It is. But it's nice in spring and fall.
Speaker 1: You really don't need to.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon.
Speaker 1: I hope so, Too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me.
Speaker 2: Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington.
Speaker 2: Of course. I will.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the situation at that time?
Speaker 2: At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by, Her tone is best, Neither over-passionate, Nor too cold.
Speaker 1: What's her outlook?
Speaker 2: She was pretty, Her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate, Waving gently to her shoulders. Her complexion was clear and golden.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Not at all. This dress certainly shows your good taste.
Speaker 2: That's quite a compliment coming from you.
Speaker 1: What kind of college is it?
Speaker 2: Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies ...
Speaker 1: Maybe you're right. But I really don't like it.
Speaker 2: Well, We'd better go to a musical comedy next time. I think the one we saw last month was very good.
Speaker 1: Yes, They had constant changes of scene, And I love variety.
Speaker 2: Me, Too. I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another.
Speaker 1: Do you think it will help?
Speaker 2: It has to! I'Ve been studying every day, Eight hours a day! I don't know, But the school has a great success record.
Speaker 1: Hmm... Maybe I should sign up too.
Speaker 2: I'll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I liked it, Too. It was scary, But not disgusting. I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins. He's brilliant.
Speaker 2: Mmm. That's what I thought, Too. And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes, He is brilliant. What's the name of the young actor?
Speaker 2: Hum, Edward Norton, Or something like that.
Speaker 1: Yes. He was excellent. They worked well together.
Speaker 1: Around seven.
Speaker 2: Ok, Great, Should i bring anything?
Speaker 1: No, But thanks for offering, Actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat, Do you have any?
Speaker 2: Sure, I will be happy to bring a few, What is the address?
Speaker 1: Don't worry, I will come to pick you up at about six thirty.
Speaker 1: They're also one of the richest couples. They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want.
Speaker 2: I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars.
Speaker 1: Did either one of them win an Oscar this year?
Speaker 2: I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films, But I don't think he won anything.
Speaker 1: There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick.
Speaker 2: And?
Speaker 1: So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.
Speaker 2: And it's a brick?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?
Speaker 1: I wanted to. But he said, No, The box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, Other people won't believe it's new.
Speaker 1: Great. I am not interested in Chinese chess. It is too difficult for me.
Speaker 2: You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess. Both of them are much easier.
Speaker 1: Ok, I will try. As for stamp, Don't you think it is an expensive hobby?
Speaker 2: Yes, It is. But it is full of fun and knowledge. What about you, What do you like to do as hobby?
Speaker 1: I like gardening. I take care of them everyday. I like those flowers and the swing in my garden. If the weather is nice, I would like to lie on the lawn.
Speaker 1: So, What damage does ozone do to the environment?
Speaker 2: Well, It can cause smog, Which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties.
Speaker 1: Then would you like to have lunch with us?
Speaker 2: I'd love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now.
Speaker 1: Would you like me to give you a lift?
Speaker 2: No, Thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there.
Speaker 1: Come on. It's no trouble at all.
Speaker 2: Ok, Thank you.
Speaker 1: That's a good point. Let me change my question. What sports do women like best?
Speaker 2: Well, I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports.
Speaker 1: Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized?
Speaker 2: Are you suggesting that anyone can be?
Speaker 1: Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes?
Speaker 2: Sure, More elegant and taller.
Speaker 1: I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy. The face powder will lighten my skin color.
Speaker 2: If I were your date, I would be so charmed by you.
Speaker 1: No regrets.
Speaker 2: I am really pleased with it.
Speaker 1: I am glad you are happy.
Speaker 2: It's super.
Speaker 1: Come on. It's on me.
Speaker 2: Really? It's very nice of you.

Speaker 2: Wonderful! You know what? I wish you wanted to relax everyday.
Speaker 1: Dream on!

Speaker 2: Yes, Please.
Speaker 1: Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book.
Speaker 2: Thank you. What shall I do when I check out these books?
Speaker 1: Take the card, And fill in your name and library card number.

Speaker 2: I don't mind the work. I think it's worthwhile.
Speaker 1: Hey! I'm trying to be nice, And you still want to fight! Did you get the statue or not?
Speaker 2: You mean fat boy?
Speaker 1: Sorry. I take that back. I mean the copper Buddha you wanted.
Speaker 1: According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.
Speaker 2: I am sure I can get a 95 this time.
Speaker 1: You like to communicate with him?
Speaker 1: Thank you. And what's on tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Tarzan.
Speaker 1: Can we get tickets now?
Speaker 2: I am afraid not. Tomorrow is premiere.
Speaker 1: Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?
Speaker 2: I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it.
Speaker 1: I haven't ever cared for that myself.
Speaker 2: Have you ever had garlic ice cream?
Speaker 1: That sounds absolutely disgusting!
Speaker 2: It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, Though.
Speaker 1: Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city?

Speaker 1: Good idea. I'd be very happy to go there.
Speaker 1: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, Even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, How long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?
Speaker 1: Ah, Yes. I remember now. Were you Mr. John's dinner partner last month?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was. You work for 3M, Right?
Speaker 1: I did but now I'm for Microsoft. How are things with you?
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: May I know what you do?
Speaker 2: I'm a fashion designer. Next month, I have a fashion show. I'd love it if come. I can get you a couple of tickets. So you can bring a friend if you like.
Speaker 1: Sure. That would be great. Good luck.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Actually, I have to admit that you're right. I like some pretty cheesy movies too. I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks, Especially \"Terminator.\".
Speaker 2: Haha, That's definitely a cheesy movie too. Did you watch it over and over again?
Speaker 1: Well... I saw it only once, But for the next two months when I talked to people, I pretended I was the Terminator.
Speaker 1: No problem. I'm an 'Olympic expert'.
Speaker 2: Wow, You've talked the talk. Now it's time to walk the walk. Here we go. First, Can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics?

Speaker 2: Anytime. You can reach me 5558929.
Speaker 1: Ok, Got it. I'll call you sometime next week.
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: Yeah, My boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me. Or I chat with my friends through text messages.
Speaker 2: Fortunately her class is just an elective course, Not as important as compulsory courses.
Speaker 1: Right, So we must spare some time to attend selective courses.
Speaker 1: But these people say nothing about that. They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days.
Speaker 2: That's not right, Somebody should do something.
Speaker 1: Terrific, That's a wonderful movie, I like it very much. Can I get tickets now for tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Yes, 20 yuan for each.
Speaker 1: Two tickets, Please.
Speaker 2: Ok. Here you are.
Speaker 1: Are you sure about that?
Speaker 2: I'm quite sure. I've always loved working with children.
Speaker 1: You have to. It is sure.
Speaker 2: How amazing!
Speaker 1: I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica, I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States. I'm a spy for the Indian government.
Speaker 2: What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here?
Speaker 1: When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, And my father was a renowned chemist. One day, He was approached by members of the CIA, Claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.
Speaker 2: What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most importantly, Why did you lie to me!
Speaker 1: Well, Birds of a feather flock together. I like her too. She was in a lot of dramas.
Speaker 2: She is so beautiful and elegant. And she is famous for her fine acting.
Speaker 1: What's more, She doesn't have scandals. And she likes to take part in the charitable activities.
Speaker 2: Who is the director?
Speaker 1: Steven Spielberg. Another superstar.
Speaker 1: My roommate's having a party.
Speaker 1: Well then, You should get some rest this weekend and don't go out drinking.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think you're right!
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I had a bad dream. I was walking alone in the graveyard, And suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves. They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood.
Speaker 1: Oh, What a nightmare! Then what happened?
Speaker 2: My mother woke me up. She had heard me crying out for help.
Speaker 1: You have got a great mother.
Speaker 2: I felt embarrased. After all, I am 18 years old. Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk.
Speaker 1: You are welcome.
Speaker 1: Cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar!
Speaker 2: Yeah, But I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, The manager would be pretty upset.
Speaker 1: That's true. I'm wondering did you learn anything from the job?
Speaker 2: Of course. There's always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world.
Speaker 1: You mean you got working experience, Right?
Speaker 2: Not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.
Speaker 1: That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, We are in Pacific Standard Time, That is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, Then we were in China Standard Time, And that's eight time zones east of Greenwich!
Speaker 2: That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time difference, Even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, We still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It's like we went back in time!
Speaker 1: Really? Then just ask her to follow me.
Speaker 2: I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming, Aren't you?
Speaker 1: Yes. But I still have some difficulties it breathing.
Speaker 2: Say, Kid, Keep on practicing, You're sure to be a first-class swimmer.
Speaker 1: To tell you the truth, I have never thought of being a swimmer. I swim just for fun.
Speaker 2: That's good.
Speaker 1: I'd like to study in the UK, But it's really expensive.
Speaker 2: Have you applied to any schools there?
Speaker 1: Yes, I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago.
Speaker 2: Congratulations! That's excellent news? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer?
Speaker 1: I have to get an BELTS score of 7. 5 overall. Do you think I can do that?
Speaker 1: Do you hike or fish on your trips?
Speaker 2: Yes, Both. Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles.
Speaker 1: Did you catch anything?
Speaker 2: Yes, But I threw them back.
Speaker 1: How about Joining our summer camp next week?
Speaker 2: Great! I can't wait.
Speaker 1: How far is it?
Speaker 2: Oh, About 10 miles. It takes me about an hour.
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound too bad. I wish I could do it, But I work in the city. So I take the train.
Speaker 2: You're doing your part for the environment by using public transportation, Too.
Speaker 1: True. Well, See you tomorrow.
Speaker 2: See you.
Speaker 1: I'm afraid not! Now this is just between you and me.
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm still happy I left. I'm working as a freelancer now.
Speaker 2: You really should have stayed with us, Dave.
Speaker 1: What if there is no chance? I mean what if you don't have a partner, What will you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I talk to myself. That is, I play one role first, Then the other.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. You are really creative.
Speaker 1: Ok, Sounds good. But I think it's your trick.
Speaker 1: I'm just a little tired.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: I have a lot of work to do in the company recently.
Speaker 2: How is your family?
Speaker 1: Pretty fine, Thanks.
Speaker 2: Where are you going now?
Speaker 1: I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents. Oh, It's two o' clock. I must go now.
Speaker 2: Ok, See you next time.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You can say that again. It's noisy too.
Speaker 2: I am glad I did not drive a car.
Speaker 1: I like spring, Too. We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air.
Speaker 1: Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like?
Speaker 2: Well, He's thin and tall. He has brown hair, A holt nose, Green eyes and wearing glasses.
Speaker 1: Mm. I've seen him a couple of times, I think.
Speaker 1: What do you need help with?
Speaker 2: I am looking for a newspaper article.
Speaker 1: Have you looked in the periodicals?
Speaker 2: I didn't even think about that.
Speaker 1: I can show you where they are.
Speaker 2: That would be a lot of help.
Speaker 1: Follow me, Please.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much.
Speaker 1: What depends?
Speaker 2: Oh, That means I can't make sure for my own.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't think of that. Well, This reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China. Plenty of food and drink, Music and dancing, And interesting traditions.
Speaker 2: Wait until you see what happens next! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet. Let's go over and watch.
Speaker 1: Good idea.
Speaker 1: So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society, I'd just look under 'A'.
Speaker 2: No. You'd look under 'W'. The articles 'a' and 'the' don't count in our alphabetization, And cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as 'history of', 'introduction to', 'story of' and so forth.
Speaker 1: What if I don't know the title of the book?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I don't like to go to the movies on a date. It's noisy there.
Speaker 1: Where do you want to meet?
Speaker 2: Let's go to the coffee shop then. It's quiet there.
Speaker 1: What time should we meet?
Speaker 2: How about seven?
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 1: Yes. We can do something else if you like.
Speaker 2: Ok. Dinner and a movie will be perfect.
Speaker 1: Well. What time would you like me to pick you up?
Speaker 2: How about 7 o'clock?
Speaker 1: Good. I will see you then.
Speaker 2: Ok. Bye.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week.
Speaker 2: I think you are absolutely right. Actually, My father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks. They got married a month later.
Speaker 1: A little distraction might do you some good, Zina.
Speaker 1: And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?
Speaker 2: Forgive me darling. I'm very tired.
Speaker 1: Come on! It is really a fun game.
Speaker 1: Is it real gold?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Two-toned, White and yellow.
Speaker 1: Did you have a fight with Jack?
Speaker 2: No, But now he'll be in trouble. What's a boyfriend for? To forget about Valentine's Day?
Speaker 1: Come on, Dear! You forgot it, Too.
Speaker 2: You know, It's OK for a girl to forget these \"big days\", But for a guy, To do that is unforgivable.
Speaker 1: Is that your phone?
Speaker 2: Oh, It's Jack. Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Sure. Would you like go with me?
Speaker 2: Sounds like fun.
Speaker 1: You'll have to buy your own ticket though.
Speaker 2: Are you broke again? Let me treat you.
Speaker 1: Wow! When did you come into so much cash?
Speaker 2: You know, I am a waitress at the student center. Anyway now those final exams are almost over. I'd love a night out.
Speaker 1: Addiction? Checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? No way!
Speaker 2: Yes, It is. Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You'Ve been wasting your time on this? I can't believe it! It doesn't even look fun or challenging!
Speaker 2: My laptop is on my bed. If you think it's so easy then get on line and try to beat me.
Speaker 1: Fine!
Speaker 1: Read it!
Speaker 2: UCLA accepted me!
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I'm not joking. I got accepted!
Speaker 1: I'm so happy for you!
Speaker 2: UCLA was my second choice, But I'm happy knowing I'Ve been accepted.
Speaker 1: I am really proud of you.
Speaker 2: You have no idea how proud I am of myself.
Speaker 1: Yes that might be a better idea.
Speaker 2: Maybe we'll meet some of the artists too.
Speaker 1: Ok - let's do that then!
Speaker 1: Yes, I like the job though. Sometimes, I help other people in the office if they're having trouble online.
Speaker 2: How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information?
Speaker 1: I think it's fairly useful, But there are two big problems. First, A lot of the information you find online is false. Second, When you buy something online, You don't see it until you actually get it.
Speaker 1: If a customer is interested in some certain goods, He can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen, And then the customer can place an order online to the sales company. And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home. The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge.
Speaker 2: I see. So great.
Speaker 1: With the greatest pleasure. Where is the concert this evening?
Speaker 2: It will be held at the Music Hall.
Speaker 1: What's on the program?
Speaker 2: It's a piano recital. I'm fond of piano, You know.
Speaker 1: Wow, What a beautiful lake! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery.
Speaker 2: En, It's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it.
Speaker 1: I feel as if I'm living in a different world, Honey.
Speaker 2: The same to me. All the things here make me happy, The mountain, The water, The grass, The birds, The sunshine...
Speaker 1: I think we should go out more frequently. The natural scenery can do us good.
Speaker 2: That's the point. We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time.
Speaker 1: They're not actually that bad. They could be worse. What do you think about it?
Speaker 2: I don't mind it, Actually. I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day.
Speaker 1: So are you enjoying your new job?
Speaker 2: It's much better than my old one. My new boss is great.
Speaker 1: How do you like working in sales?
Speaker 2: I like the fact that I get to work with people. It makes the day go by much faster.
Speaker 1: Relax, It was just a goat!
Speaker 2: And that?
Speaker 1: It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later.
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: Honey, Seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax!
Speaker 2: Relax, That was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.
Speaker 1: You know what? I don't think I can hack it here out in the countryside. I'm going back to the city!
Speaker 1: How do you total our scores?
Speaker 2: The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework, Attendance, And quizzes are the rest.
Speaker 1: What if we are out sick?
Speaker 2: Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.
Speaker 1: How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?
Speaker 2: Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on.
Speaker 1: No, It isn't. It's a pity, Because I'd like to see it in action.
Speaker 2: So would i. What other unusual plants did they show?
Speaker 1: They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, When the insect molle.
Speaker 2: That's very specialized. So, The insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, The other would too.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much indeed. You helped me rebuild my self-confidence.
Speaker 2: Don't mention it. You're always been good. What do you say we go out to celebrate?
Speaker 1: That would be great.
Speaker 1: I can't believe it! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure.
Speaker 2: What were the odds?
Speaker 1: 20 to 1, In favour of the Cougars!
Speaker 2: Too bad.
Speaker 1: That's OK. You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them.
Speaker 1: I think there's more you need to do.
Speaker 2: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: My hair looks awful.
Speaker 2: What don't you like about it?
Speaker 1: I just don't like my hair.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry that you don't like it.
Speaker 1: I won't be paying you for this.
Speaker 2: I'm sure we can work something out.
Speaker 1: Susan, Just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her. There is nothing for you to be jealous about. I like your company much better than Janet's.
Speaker 2: I envy her and also I hate her at the same time.
Speaker 1: Honey, You should know that I love you so deeply.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And that's so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational!
Speaker 2: Right. You can't blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes.
Speaker 1: In my country, There's a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown. I think it's about six minutes per hour.
Speaker 1: I'll be yours through endless time.
Speaker 2: I see. And I'll always be devoted to you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I know I've nothing to offer you, But I'll never give you reason to cry.
Speaker 2: I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie.
Speaker 1: My love will grow, Like a river to flow.
Speaker 2: It can't be dry, And can't die.
Speaker 1: I don't know whether we are in a dream.
Speaker 2: Aha, Aha...
Speaker 1: What for?
Speaker 2: So I can have a special place to hang out with friends, And also do some barbecuing on weekends.
Speaker 1: That sounds cool. Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job?
Speaker 2: You? Do you have a carpenter's license?
Speaker 1: Yes, Of course. But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle.
Speaker 2: Wow! That's cool. So, Let me give you some details about the deck I want.
Speaker 1: Please go ahead, I am listening.
Speaker 1: I want to try something exciting.
Speaker 2: It's an easy way to get hurt, Let me tell you.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you all about it next Monday.
Speaker 2: Well, Take care of yourself, And don't say I didn't warn you.
Speaker 1: But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president.
Speaker 1: That's too bad. Do you have any foreign teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes, My oral English teacher is an American. He is from a small town in California.
Speaker 1: What is he like?
Speaker 2: He is great. He always tells us not to study for exams, And to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing.
Speaker 1: Are you able to follow him?
Speaker 2: Not everything, But nearly. He speaks very clearly.
Speaker 1: What's to come next?
Speaker 2: If they agree to enroll you, They will send you aTAP - 66 Form. WithTAP - 66, You can apply for a passport from our government, And then apply for a visa from the US. Embassy in Beijing.
Speaker 1: How do you research your books?
Speaker 2: I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories. Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction! I usually base my characters on people I have met. Most charact.
Speaker 1: I really like your books. I'Ve just finished this one. I read it from cover to cover in a single day. Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again!
Speaker 1: They're blue.
Speaker 2: What color is her hair?
Speaker 1: It's brown.
Speaker 2: How old is she?
Speaker 1: She's 42.
Speaker 1: Sure, Here it is.
Speaker 2: Well, This looks nice. Do you know how to use it?
Speaker 1: I am pretty sure how to use it, But can you remind me?
Speaker 2: Of course, Just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits!
Speaker 1: Do you have any hobbies?
Speaker 2: I like to paint..
Speaker 1: What kind of things do you paint?
Speaker 2: Mainly seascapes.
Speaker 1: What kinds of sports do you like?
Speaker 2: I like almost all sports, And I enjoy both playing and watching. I especially like tennis and mountain climbing. I was in the climbing club all through school.
Speaker 1: Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Speaker 1: Would you like to apply for one right now?
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: I'm going to need you to fill out the application.
Speaker 2: All right. All done.
Speaker 1: All right, Now please sign the back of the card.
Speaker 2: Okay. I'Ve signed it.
Speaker 1: That's all there is to it.
Speaker 2: Great. Now can I check out this book?
Speaker 1: You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans?
Speaker 2: That's right, Quite different. One day one of my American friend looked pale, So I asked him whether he was sick or not. But he was reluctant to answer my question.
Speaker 1: That's weird.
Speaker 2: And what's more, When he told me he had caught a cold for several days, I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible.
Speaker 1: You really cared about your friend.
Speaker 2: Sure I am. But he responded by saying'what do you mean? '.
Speaker 1: Yes, The car park is under constant video surveillance, So my car is quite safe. Please get in.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Where is your key?
Speaker 1: There's no need, I have keyless entry, And the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car. Now, We can look at the navigation system to find the best route home.
Speaker 2: That's amazing, It even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment.
Speaker 1: Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home. Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out.
Speaker 1: It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?
Speaker 2: Sure. But, It will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.
Speaker 2: Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.
Speaker 1: Yeah, My friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.
Speaker 1: Frankly yes. We like to employ married people. By the way, Do you have any children?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a three-year-old son.
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: So I take it you are not interested.
Speaker 1: No, Lucy. Don't get me wrong. I mean school will be open on Sept. 2nd, And I will have a very tight schedule by then.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule.
Speaker 1: That will be fine. When can I see him?
Speaker 2: Let's do it this way. I'll take him to your place this Saturday. Then you two can make a schedule.
Speaker 1: Is it official?
Speaker 1: Yes. Here's my identification.
Speaker 2: That's all you need.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. By the way, How many books am I allowed to check out?
Speaker 2: You can check out two books at a time. But you can't check out newspapers, Magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library.
Speaker 1: How long can I keep the books?
Speaker 2: For two weeks. After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer.
Speaker 1: James is going to be packed off there.
Speaker 2: That is good. He can leave you alone this time.
Speaker 1: Okay...
Speaker 2: I don't want to beat around the bush so I'm just gonna come out with it. We are going to have to let you go.
Speaker 1: What? Why? I mean... Just like that? I'm fired?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry but, To be honest, You are a terrible employee!
Speaker 1: What! I resent that!
Speaker 1: Well, My dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth. David called me this morning.
Speaker 2: So when did all this happen?
Speaker 1: Last weekend, While they were on the Sik trip.
Speaker 2: Well, I believe it now, And when are they are getting married?
Speaker 1: Next June.
Speaker 2: I can hardly believe it.
Speaker 1: That's rock and roll with fast tempo.
Speaker 2: I like the slow dance. I am good at rumba and waltz.
Speaker 1: Take it easy. The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party.
Speaker 2: Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage.
Speaker 1: Ok, Follow me.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: And Tom, You will help Johnny with his homework, Won't you?
Speaker 2: I'll see. I will if I can but I won't promise.
Speaker 1: But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you?
Speaker 2: Yes. But only if you ask me nicely.
Speaker 1: Tom, Darling. You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you? Please!
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll keep my promise.
Speaker 1: Come on! Don't be silly!
Speaker 2: Your present job is something better. Why do you change?
Speaker 1: Well. How do you know?
Speaker 1: How dare you be so inconsiderate? That's wrong.
Speaker 2: I am awfully sorry. I didn't think you would mind so much.
Speaker 1: Never do that again.
Speaker 2: I promise.
Speaker 1: It's said that her new movie is going to come out.
Speaker 2: What's the movie about?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about?
Speaker 1: I already told you, Because Julia Roberts is in it. I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities.
Speaker 2: Yeah, She is great. I also admire her for her concern about society.
Speaker 1: How long can I keep the books?
Speaker 2: For one month. If you can't return the books in time, You'll be fined. But if you renew them, You can keep them longer.
Speaker 1: I see. Now I want to check out two books on spoken English. Can you show me where I can find them?
Speaker 2: Yes, Just over there to your right.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: They offer clearer and sharper images. Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses, A photo mode and fast-action mode.
Speaker 1: They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand.
Speaker 2: Right! Anyway, The basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital.
Speaker 1: Oh, Come on. That's no reason to do something you're not interested in.
Speaker 2: Well... What are you interested in?
Speaker 1: How about the Classical Music Club?
Speaker 2: Joanna, Give me a break.
Speaker 1: Hey-how about the Cinema Club?
Speaker 1: Failure just isn't an option for her. I'm glad she's on our team.
Speaker 1: It is not an easy job. The government is working on it. Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital. Also, Methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought. But of course, It will not work overnight. So, Have you come out with a new plan for today?
Speaker 1: I can't let you do that.
Speaker 2: Why is that?
Speaker 1: Our policy doesn't allow anyone to check out the magazines.
Speaker 2: What things am I allowed to check out?
Speaker 1: You are only allowed to check out books or videos.
Speaker 2: I really need to check out this magazine.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, But that's our policy.
Speaker 2: That's stupid.
Speaker 1: He is going to Canada and to live with his son.
Speaker 2: What a pity!
Speaker 1: Why did you say that? It's a good thing for him to live with his son.
Speaker 2: I know that. But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour. You know I always appreciate Tom's company.
Speaker 1: Me too. But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll probably just stay at home.
Speaker 1: Good for you. Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world.
Speaker 2: Also some traditional Chinese food, Like noodles anddumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality. I heard this year, The government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control. For sure all the customers will benefit from this.
Speaker 1: What have you been up to?
Speaker 2: I just started working out.
Speaker 1: Really? Where do you work out at?
Speaker 2: I joined the Samsung Health Club last month.
Speaker 1: What do you mostly do during your workout?
Speaker 2: I concentrate mostly on my legs, Chest, Arms and stomach.
Speaker 1: I should start exercising more.
Speaker 2: It's hard work while exercising, But it is a great feeling when I get done.
Speaker 1: I have a running machine at home. I used to use it, But I already got sick of it.
Speaker 1: You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself. You shouldn't affect her decision.
Speaker 2: But I just want to give her some tips.
Speaker 1: Oh, She can make her own decisions.
Speaker 1: Ok. People decorate their houses, Place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together.
Speaker 1: But you're busy, Aren't you?
Speaker 2: I was preparing my supper but I've finished now.
Speaker 1: I can leave the parcel with you, Can't I?
Speaker 2: Oh! Yes.
Speaker 1: I had to carry my backpack with me all day.
Speaker 2: Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Does it have a lock?
Speaker 2: No. You have to buy your own. You'll have to go to a hardware store to pick one up.
Speaker 1: That guy was definitely a Don.
Speaker 2: So now you can say you had a mafia experience. Ha-ha.
Speaker 1: Yeah. If I leave Little Italy alive...
Speaker 2: Are you kidding? Don had fun scaring you. He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. Go on!
Speaker 2: My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business. He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school.
Speaker 1: So he became a self-taught man?
Speaker 2: Right. Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village. When he was middle aged, He became a great man, Quite famous.
Speaker 1: I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved.
Speaker 2: Yes, You could be right. There is a lot to consider.
Speaker 1: I am also wondering about the pay.
Speaker 2: Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?
Speaker 1: I am thinking that might be the case.
Speaker 2: I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change your mind.
Speaker 1: I should have some free time next week. Say, Next Wednesday evening?
Speaker 2: That's good for me, But do you think you'll be back by then? I'd really like to see you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday.
Speaker 2: Great! That's settled then.
Speaker 1: You are full of boasts. I can examine you by question and answer. What is Hollywood? Where is it? What is the function of it?
Speaker 2: Too easy questions. Listen carefully. Hollywood is the movie capital of the world. It is located in southern California. Many films have been made there, And the kinds have changed often.
Speaker 1: Not bad. What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930's.
Speaker 2: Gangster movies. Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it.
Speaker 1: You too.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. You know, We spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, And the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband. I always feel good afterward.
Speaker 2: That's great! I'Ve heard people say that before.
Speaker 1: They see their independence as a kind of character strength.
Speaker 2: Sometimes they are too independent.
Speaker 1: Pick up a wood and hold it like this, Interlocking your fingers.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: Position yourself, Swinging the club, Watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can.
Speaker 2: Hey!
Speaker 1: Not too bad. The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible.
Speaker 2: Got it.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. But this isn't a no-smoker, Is it? I mean would you mind if I smoke here?
Speaker 2: Actually it is. Perhaps you haven't noticed the sign.
Speaker 1: Sign? What's sign?
Speaker 2: There, On the window.
Speaker 1: Oh, Sorry. I didn't notice it. Sorry.
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: They go to the home of the bride?
Speaker 2: Why do you ask?
Speaker 1: The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite.
Speaker 2: Oh! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement, Costs, Etc. So the reception is held at her home.
Speaker 1: So what do you do with all the out-dated issues?
Speaker 2: I guess I'm lending them to you...
Speaker 1: Do you mean The Bangkok?
Speaker 2: That's the one. A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night. How about coming with us?
Speaker 1: Sure, I'd love to.
Speaker 2: Great. I'll call and make reservations.
Speaker 1: Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me. Oh! I'm late! I have a class.
Speaker 2: All right. I'll call you tonight and tell you the time.
Speaker 1: Great. Talk to you then.
Speaker 1: Actually, We thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays.
Speaker 2: That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.
Speaker 1: Yes, We've invited four other couples, So it should be a good mix of people.
Speaker 2: That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, Everyone we are inviting is from our company.
Speaker 1: So beat the cat, But don't kill it.
Speaker 1: Weren't you frightened?
Speaker 2: Sure. But I still liked it.
Speaker 1: Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself?
Speaker 2: No. Although motorcycle is nice, I'd like to buy a bicycle.
Speaker 1: But why? Since you like it so much.
Speaker 2: Because bicycles are safer.
Speaker 1: I agree with you.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know where the bookstore is.
Speaker 2: Ok, So once you pass the gym, It's the first door on your left. Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know I could do that.
Speaker 2: You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be going there today?
Speaker 1: Yes, I am going today.
Speaker 2: Well, If you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Miss, But I'm afraid we can't do that. You'll order something else instead. I'd love to suggest the steak, It's the special today, And quite tasty.
Speaker 2: Ok, Then please bring me the steak mediun-rare, Thank you.
Speaker 1: Ok, Miss. I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner.
Speaker 1: That's just it! I don't know what to get her! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small! I suck at getting presents for people.
Speaker 2: That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess peoples' likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like!
Speaker 1: Yeah, You're right. When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.
Speaker 1: I'm glad they're coming in August. Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game.
Speaker 2: And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park.
Speaker 1: Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. We all sat on the grass, And Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs.
Speaker 1: I had a great time. It'll be good to see them again.
Speaker 1: Sure, When those never ending meetings.
Speaker 1: Where did you go? You've got a beautiful tan.
Speaker 2: My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks, So we compromised and finally went to the seaside. I think vacation in summer is not good.
Speaker 1: You must have had a great time. Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming.
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm already working for WebTracker. Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth, So I figured, What the heck.
Speaker 2: No kidding! I can't believe this. You devil!
Speaker 1: It's kind of cool, Isn't it? I'm sort of like a secret agent.
Speaker 1: You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness.
Speaker 2: It will for me. Then I can do all the things I want to do.
Speaker 1: You'll get bored eventually.
Speaker 2: Then I can find something new to do. If I don't have to worry about money, Then I don't have to work.
Speaker 1: That's true, I guess. If I didn't have to work, I think I would be happy.
Speaker 2: You see... Money doesn't equal happiness, But it takes away a lot of responsibilities.
Speaker 1: I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.
Speaker 2: No, It will not be formal at all. It is a fun time. You will love the game show. Please dress casually. Usually there is an over abandon of drinks, So be careful with that.
Speaker 1: Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together.
Speaker 2: Ok, I'll meet you at the club at two thirty.
Speaker 1: So I think I may fall in love with her.
Speaker 2: That sounds great. But how do you know that's a crush or a real love?
Speaker 1: Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love?
Speaker 2: That's a big question. Well, If you're in love, Maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all.
Speaker 1: That's what I do.
Speaker 2: And you think about her all the time?
Speaker 1: Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, But compared to many countries in other continents, It's not very large at all.
Speaker 2: Britain is half the size of france, But great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world.
Speaker 1: The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used. Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest.
Speaker 1: I agree. But even though I like comedies, I usually prefer more serious films. My favorite movie is \"Titanic.\".
Speaker 1: How about a snack after work?
Speaker 2: I couldn't careless.
Speaker 1: Would you rather stay home?
Speaker 2: Whatever you say.
Speaker 1: Are you really interested in doing something?
Speaker 2: I don't mind if you want to.
Speaker 1: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
Speaker 2: That's because you did well.
Speaker 1: No, I wouldn't worry about you.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: It seems to me that you always do better than you say.
Speaker 1: You know, Now that I think about it, You might be right.
Speaker 2: April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements.
Speaker 1: That is a good suggestion.
Speaker 2: We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, That would let us know what would work best.
Speaker 2: I'll put the survey online this afternoon.
Speaker 1: You got a big return for a small gift.
Speaker 1: Aw come on! It's just some innocent fun! You know how these things are! We are gonna play drinking games, Get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm crazy about them.
Speaker 1: What? Cars? Are you serious?
Speaker 2: I'm pulling your leg, Paul. I'm a shopping queen, Remember? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about!
Speaker 1: Generally speaking, Food items are difficult to import. Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another. The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods. The shelf life is longer for these products.
Speaker 1: Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry.
Speaker 2: Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, But as far as I know, Most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour.
Speaker 2: Really? What do the companies do that for?
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.
Speaker 1: Then my son drove into a tree.
Speaker 2: I am sorry to hear that.
Speaker 1: The dog bit the delivery boy.
Speaker 2: What a pity!
Speaker 1: And a storm blew our roof away.
Speaker 2: Ho, No!
Speaker 1: Mary, This is Mr. Wu, My new Chinese friend.
Speaker 2: How do you do, Mr. Wu? Welcome.
Speaker 1: How do you do?
Speaker 2: Have a glass of wine, Mr. Wu? And let me introduce you to some of my guests.
Speaker 1: We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning.
Speaker 2: No wonder it smells fragrant.
Speaker 1: Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later.
Speaker 2: It's fantastic!
Speaker 1: Jen, It's not alive... But it does look user-friendly.
Speaker 2: I would look so cool carrying this around!
Speaker 1: And you'd look so cool!
Speaker 1: What do you think of the literature course?
Speaker 2: It's very helpful. The course has let me into a new world of literature. I read so many great literatures.
Speaker 1: Again, As you see on your course outline, Grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test, Periodic quizzes, And classroom participation.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not.
Speaker 1: You're right. By the way, Did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently?
Speaker 2: Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago.
Speaker 1: They did. He inherited the money from an uncle. I hope he doesn't lose a lot of it in taxed to the government.
Speaker 1: Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute?
Speaker 2: No, Everyone keeps in mind that 'Don't intrude in a family dispute'.
Speaker 1: Three or four o'clock?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I never stay out that late. That's too late.
Speaker 2: But why is it too late? It's Saturday night. You have nothing to do tomorrow. Why not stay out and drink with us?
Speaker 1: Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei, Sharon?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was. And I like living here. People know how to party here. In Taipei, Some people know how to party. But here, Everyone does.
Speaker 1: What is that they're doing on the couch?
Speaker 2: They're smoking pot. Don't worry about it.
Speaker 1: Oh? What's wrong with his girlfriend?
Speaker 2: She came over last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out. I tried to smile and be polite, But the whole time all I could think was \"what's wrong with your voice?\".
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to.
Speaker 2: I doubt it. Last time was an oral train wreck. Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil.
Speaker 1: Yes...
Speaker 2: Can I have my $ 200 please?
Speaker 1: Sure. Here you are, $ 200, Thank you, Please come again! Now it's my turn to roll the dice.
Speaker 1: Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening. Would you like to come with me?
Speaker 2: Sure. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Then I'll pick you up at six thirty. Ok?
Speaker 2: Ok, See you.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: It's hard to say, Because each team has my idols.
Speaker 2: Wow! Ac wins. It is a close shave, You know.
Speaker 1: I will never forget this match. The angle is so terrible and so correct.
Speaker 2: What a good goal!
Speaker 1: It might be the English teacher. What about you?
Speaker 2: Me, Too. She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her.
Speaker 1: She is a pretty good teacher! With her help I think I can make great progress in English.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like her way of teaching. She told us not to cram for exams, And to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing.
Speaker 1: What is especially impressive?
Speaker 2: There are thousands of hot springs and fountains. The park is known for them.
Speaker 1: Is there a waterfall?
Speaker 2: Yes. The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon.
Speaker 1: What an attractive place! How can I get there?
Speaker 2: You can take No. 2 bus.
Speaker 1: Ok, Each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, You set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, It can move one space diagonally.
Speaker 2: What about all these other pieces?
Speaker 1: See this one that looks like a tower? It's called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, It's a very important piece so it's best to not let your opponent capture it.
Speaker 2: And these two? They are husband and wife?
Speaker 1: Of course if I can.
Speaker 2: Well, Last night when I returned from thetheatre I found I lost my wallet.
Speaker 1: Oh dear. That's terrible. What was in your wallet?
Speaker 2: Well, Some money of course, A vise, All my identity cards and some photos.
Speaker 1: Well, If I were you, I would go to the police station straight away and calling.
Speaker 2: Yes, I have already done that and they already look for it. I'll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly.
Speaker 1: You mean... Like on a second date?
Speaker 2: Of course! Or are you still too scared!
Speaker 1: No way! That sounds great!
Speaker 1: You too.
Speaker 1: You must feel really worried right now. But you know your dad is a fighter.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I think my mom is the most worried. I'm basically worried about how she is doing.
Speaker 1: Where is she right now?
Speaker 2: She's in the hospital with my dad. I have to go back tonight.
Speaker 1: Hey, I'll go with you.
Speaker 1: Hey, Thanks, Mum.
Speaker 1: Wow!! And what does your brother do?
Speaker 2: He's a painter. He's working in Argentina this month. He has an exhibition there.
Speaker 1: What an interesting family!
Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that.
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: What's your plan now?
Speaker 2: After the tour I'll have a rest. And then go to find a new job.
Speaker 1: Best wishes for you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Oh dear, That sounds terrible.
Speaker 2: It was! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt.
Speaker 1: Oh dear. Well, Get well soon and try to be more careful in future.
Speaker 1: For killing time and making new friends.
Speaker 2: Don't you think it's too noisy here? The rock music! I can hardly bear it.
Speaker 1: Calm down! My little guy! You'll get used to that after you come here several times.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll try. Then what would you like to drink? It's on me.
Speaker 1: I'd like a gin and tonic.
Speaker 1: Yes, I am.
Speaker 2: Why don't you run off with him? What are you waiting for?
Speaker 1: I don't actually know him.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: I only know him through the... You are not gonna believe this.
Speaker 2: Oh, Let me guess. Through the internet?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Hmm. 'You'Ve got mail. '.
Speaker 1: I think I'd go lonely if I do like that.
Speaker 2: And where would you get a cup of cappuccino?
Speaker 1: Now that would be hard to live without. We city folks are pretty spoiled.
Speaker 1: Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday?
Speaker 2: I'm afraid I never go for a holiday. It's always business.
Speaker 1: Maybe you are right, So I will try my best to find a suitable job.
Speaker 1: No, At night.
Speaker 2: Sorry, That's too late. I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM.
Speaker 1: Ok, How about 1:30 PM?
Speaker 2: No, That's too early. I'll still be at work then.
Speaker 1: How about 5:00 PM?
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Ok, See you then.
Speaker 2: Alright. Bye.
Speaker 1: So you haven't done much then, In Shanghai?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'Ve eaten soupdumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu. They were delicious!
Speaker 1: Let's see. Have you been to a jazz club yet?
Speaker 2: Yes. I've already been to several clubs here.
Speaker 1: Ok. What about an evening riverboat tour?
Speaker 2: Uh, Actually, I've gone twice this week.
Speaker 1: So, What do you want to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I haven't been to the theater in a long time.
Speaker 1: Oh, Ok. I hear there's a terrific show at theSanger Theater.
Speaker 2: Great! Let's make a reservation.
Speaker 1: I like alternative music.
Speaker 2: Do you have a favorite band?
Speaker 1: To be honest, No. I'm always in search of new music to listen to.
Speaker 2: Do you often go to concerts?
Speaker 1: I usually go to see a live band about twice a month. What about you?
Speaker 2: I love going to live gigs. Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend?
Speaker 1: There's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays. You should come along next week with me.
Speaker 1: Can you make my hair short?
Speaker 2: Exactly how short do you want it?
Speaker 1: Make it a few inches long.
Speaker 2: Are you sure you want me to cut it that short?
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about this for a while now.
Speaker 2: Okay. I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want.
Speaker 1: I honestly want my hair that short.
Speaker 2: All right, Then let's begin.
Speaker 1: Ok, I will.
Speaker 1: And how's your brother?
Speaker 2: He is fine.
Speaker 1: He's going to be sent to Britain to study, Really?
Speaker 2: Yes. He's already got the passport and visa.
Speaker 1: Fantastic! Please send him my congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you. He's very lucky indeed.
Speaker 1: I am not sure, Where exactly is it?
Speaker 2: Well, Not so far from New York. So what about you? Did you grow up here?
Speaker 1: No, I was born in Gaoxiong, I only moved to Taipei after I graduated.
Speaker 1: I don't see any wrinkles orsagging skin! You are stop beings ridiculous. Besides, I think that people who get Boto, Have facelifts, Or tummytucks look weird. It doesn't look natural.
Speaker 2: Whatever, I think I'm gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.
Speaker 1: I think you need to get brain surgery. I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery. You look amazing.
Speaker 2: I thought you were my friend and would support me on this! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.
Speaker 1: I want games that are all luck.
Speaker 2: I knew you would say that! Then you should play the slot machines.
Speaker 1: Slot machines? No, I don't want that! That's too boring. I want a game with cards or dice.
Speaker 2: So what do you want to play then?
Speaker 1: Blackjack. We can play blackjack. And I will gamble one-hundred, Or maybe two-hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: It's normal. Time will change everything.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. You know, We spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, And the other days I play badminton with my husband. I always feel good afterward.
Speaker 2: That's great! I'Ve heard people say that before.
Speaker 1: Yes, You will have to pay to use it.
Speaker 2: How much?
Speaker 1: It costs ten cents a copy.
Speaker 2: Am I limited to a certain number of copies?
Speaker 1: You can copy as much as you'd like.
Speaker 2: Could you show me how to use the copier?
Speaker 1: The instructions for the copier are posted on it.
Speaker 2: That's fabulous. Thank you.
Speaker 1: How about a dinner tonight? My treat.
Speaker 2: Actually, I prefer to eat at home, And then we'll have more time to have a chat.
Speaker 1: All right. Let me prepare the supper.
Speaker 1: I wonder how long this weather can last.
Speaker 2: I hope it will stay fine tomorrow. I'm going to have a picnic with my family.
Speaker 1: Yes, I am. I am from Taiwan. I came here to study political science.
Speaker 2: How do you like it?
Speaker 1: I like it so far. But my English still needs work.
Speaker 2: I want to study Mandarin and international relations.
Speaker 1: Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters?
Speaker 2: They teach regular characters.
Speaker 1: I see. I'm from Taiwan, So I know regular characters better than simplified.
Speaker 1: I try very hard. The problem is, My salary just isn't enough to live on. Now that I have a wife and a child to support, We hardly have enough money for food and rent.
Speaker 2: There are trying times for everyone. What do you propose?
Speaker 1: I could really use a 5 % rise.
Speaker 2: That's quite a bit. If I give you a raise, I'm going to have to give everyone a raise.
Speaker 1: I have confidence in them.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll enjoy the trip. China is such a beautiful country.
Speaker 1: I'm sure I will.
Speaker 2: Have a nice journey, Lily.
Speaker 1: Thank you, David.
Speaker 1: I am sure they will be pleased.
Speaker 1: Tomorrow morning. Try it.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: Are you going to this class this morning?
Speaker 2: Of course, Easy. No sweat.
Speaker 1: You're no able to move after this class.
Speaker 2: Are you kidding me? It's going to be up a piece of cake.
Speaker 1: You want to bet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, What't the bet?
Speaker 1: I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing.
Speaker 1: I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.
Speaker 2: Maybe you won't believe this, But it was made by my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Really? It looks so nice.
Speaker 2: Thank you, Please have a cup of tea.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: How about some fish?
Speaker 1: No, Thanks. I've had enough. Now, Mary, Before you blow out the birthday candles, You have to make a wish. After that, You may cut the cake.
Speaker 1: I know, But you deserve it.
Speaker 1: Are you sure?
Speaker 2: Of course I am. I only love you, Amy.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry. I believe you.
Speaker 2: Why do you always accuse me like that?
Speaker 1: Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much! I guess I just go crazy sometimes. That's all.
Speaker 2: Oh, Amy. I am the luckiest guy in the world.
Speaker 1: Would you like to have dinner with me?
Speaker 2: Oh, That would be lovely. Shall we say seven o 'clock?
Speaker 1: Perfect. I'll pick you up then.
Speaker 1: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on PowerPoint.
Speaker 2: And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Well, That was some good advice. You made some really good points.
Speaker 1: What's your comment on his new album?
Speaker 2: Gorgeous! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles. I am crazy for it, So I hear it over and again. And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile.
Speaker 1: Let me enjoy it.
Speaker 2: I suppose this song can be the No. 1 on the top chart.
Speaker 1: I cann't wait for buying his CD now.
Speaker 1: How much is it going to cost?
Speaker 2: Nothing. It's free.
Speaker 1: Is that yellow bus it?
Speaker 2: Let's go sit in the back. All the cool kids do.
Speaker 1: How long have you been here?
Speaker 2: 2 months.
Speaker 1: What do you do for work?
Speaker 2: I'm a student. How about you?
Speaker 1: I'm a student too.
Speaker 1: No, Can I exchange it for a bigger one?
Speaker 2: I am afraid this is the biggest size we have.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad.
Speaker 2: Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern. The price is the same and it's bigger.
Speaker 1: What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, He said he was coming.
Speaker 2: Kitty's? He sure gets around, Doesn't he?
Speaker 1: Looks like it. So how did he handle it to?
Speaker 2: His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again.
Speaker 1: I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.
Speaker 2: I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy.
Speaker 1: Doesn't sound promising.
Speaker 1: What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: For me? The football games of course, I love football games.
Speaker 1: Well, Now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it... What's-her-face... The one who always kisses up to the teacher.
Speaker 2: Jennifer Davies? Give me a break! I can't stand her. She's such adweeb! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time?
Speaker 1: She's the teacher's pet, That's why. Besides, He's so laid back he lets her get away with it. She just really rubs me the wrong way. And you know what? I think she's got the hots for him, Too.
Speaker 2: Get out of here!
Speaker 1: I see you sometimes work on weekends, Too.
Speaker 2: Yes, I really don't like it.
Speaker 2: It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, And we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, Said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee.
Speaker 1: That's pretty harsh.
Speaker 2: I know, But I was so upset. I mean, Come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Well, Actually, One of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot.
Speaker 2: Do ya?
Speaker 1: Yeah, So maybe it's my diet.
Speaker 1: Let's keep in touch.
Speaker 2: Ok. I will write to you as soon as I get there.
Speaker 1: Honey, How about taking them to the beach this weekend?
Speaker 2: That's great!
Speaker 1: Since last time we've climbed the mountain, We haven't gone out for a long time.
Speaker 2: And this kind of weather is rare for the season either.
Speaker 1: Yes, I remember last year this time, The weather is so hot.
Speaker 2: So we must seize this chance to go the beach.
Speaker 1: Daniel loves the beach very much!
Speaker 1: What store do you shop at?
Speaker 2: The small one, Just down the street. I like their generic brand.
Speaker 1: I have been using the store across town for years.
Speaker 2: I hear they have very nice stuff.
Speaker 1: They do, But they're a little expensive on certain items.
Speaker 2: Well, You should try my store. The prices are good.
Speaker 1: I will sometime. Thanks for the advice.
Speaker 1: Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, The latest type.
Speaker 2: You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea.
Speaker 1: No, There is an updated version, Three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, You can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes.
Speaker 2: I don't think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time.
Speaker 1: So do I. You are a beautiful flower in my mind.
Speaker 2: It's called love is blind, I think.
Speaker 1: They are especially harmful to teenagers.
Speaker 2: But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs.
Speaker 1: How is everything?
Speaker 2: Just fine, And you?
Speaker 1: Quite well, Thank you.
Speaker 2: Did you drive yourself to the airport?
Speaker 1: No, I was driven by my husband.
Speaker 2: Did someone meet you at the airport here?
Speaker 1: Yes, Thanks.
Speaker 2: Is this where we'll be holding the meeting?
Speaker 1: No, The meeting will be held on the fourth floor.
Speaker 1: True. Ok. Let's see it this Saturday.
Speaker 2: How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00, And then go see the movie afterwards.
Speaker 1: Sounds like a plan. Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00.
Speaker 1: Friday's not good. I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work.
Speaker 2: Ok, Then let's try to go this weekend. I should know if I can go by Friday. Is it OK if I call you then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, That's fine.
Speaker 2: What's your number?
Speaker 1: Face it, You don't like action movies because you're a snob.
Speaker 2: No, I don't like action movies because I'm cultured!
Speaker 1: No, We are just too different. This relationship isn't going anywhere.
Speaker 2: Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.
Speaker 1: I have thought about it for a long time. I think it's time to move on for both of us.
Speaker 2: But I still love you.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I knew this would happen some day...
Speaker 1: Then why didn't you talk to me?
Speaker 2: Well. It's not all my fault, Anna...
Speaker 1: How old is he today?
Speaker 2: It's his 50th birthday.
Speaker 1: Well, Wish him a happy birthday for me.
Speaker 2: Sure thing. What are your plans for the evening?
Speaker 1: I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight.
Speaker 2: Well, If you can wait until tomorrow night, I'll go with you then.
Speaker 1: Sorry, I've got people coming over tomorrow night.
Speaker 2: Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us.
Speaker 1: Ok, The form is all filled out.
Speaker 2: Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?
Speaker 1: No, I have no idea what they are.
Speaker 2: Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.
Speaker 1: Yes, Right.
Speaker 2: Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.
Speaker 1: I don't think we are boring. It's just that we don't have any hobbies.
Speaker 2: That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?
Speaker 1: That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, So I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.
Speaker 2: I like to play the piano for fun.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That can be a good hobby.
Speaker 1: No... That's not what I meant. I didn't mean that. She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara. I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends.
Speaker 2: She started feeling suspicious after you said that.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry man. I didn't know. I didn't mean to screw anything up.
Speaker 2: Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend. Now, I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you.
Speaker 1: Look. I really didn't mean to, And next time I see Martha, I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends.
Speaker 1: Come on, Let's try it.
Speaker 2: All right. If you really want to.
Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. We hope you'll visit Beijing again.
Speaker 2: Certainly. I'll be glad to.
Speaker 1: It's almost time to get aboard.
Speaker 2: Yes, We should go. Thank you very much. Goodbye!
Speaker 1: Bye bye! Have a pleasant journey!
Speaker 1: Yes, I have seen those spots.
Speaker 2: Well, When you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, Do not park there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening?
Speaker 1: I park in the evenings.
Speaker 2: Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs?
Speaker 1: Yes, I have seen those signs.
Speaker 1: Of course there is. Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can.
Speaker 2: I really don't want to know about this. Physics gives me a headache.
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 1: We're watching a football match. What's the matter?
Speaker 2: Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry about this.
Speaker 2: Please turn down the TV. And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration.
Speaker 1: You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore.
Speaker 1: Ok, First of all, Can you turn the key in the ignition?
Speaker 2: Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.
Speaker 1: Those are possible problems, But tell me, When you turn the key, Do you hear the starter motor crank?
Speaker 2: Yeah, It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, But nothing else happens. The engine won't start. Should I maybe press the accelerator?
Speaker 1: No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.
Speaker 2: So what do you think it is?
Speaker 1: That's great. Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition. They must be terribly disappointed if they don't win.
Speaker 2: The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds.
Speaker 1: That's amazing! Were any other records broken?
Speaker 1: My husband is betting on France.
Speaker 2: France? Is he crazy?
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, How can I put this? France is a terrible team.
Speaker 1: Are you hungry? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat?
Speaker 2: No, There's no need. Thank you all the same.
Speaker 1: I just graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: Are you planning on going to university?
Speaker 1: I'd like to get a BA, But I don't know where I should go.
Speaker 2: Have you applied anywhere yet?
Speaker 1: Yes, I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them.
Speaker 2: Congratulations! Which one is the cheapest?
Speaker 1: The tuition is the same for all of them.
Speaker 1: Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while?
Speaker 2: Certainly not. Here it is.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: This machine is out of order.
Speaker 2: You shouldn't have used the machine. Did you lose your money?
Speaker 1: I sure did.
Speaker 2: You ought to complain. These machine are always out of order.
Speaker 1: In other parts of the world, Especially in Africa, There is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow e.
Speaker 2: It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains. Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people.
Speaker 1: Thanks. Some tea would be nice. Chinese tea is great. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it?
Speaker 2: Oh, There is a supermarket not far from here. But there is also a tea house around the corner, Where you can get tea and a tea set as well.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I saw the tea house the other day. I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here.
Speaker 2: You are right about that. It's quiet and very convenient. You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk. There's a grocery store, A book store, A gym, And many restaurants.
Speaker 1: You're missing the point. It's about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, As if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It's his attitude that needs to be changed, Not just his words.
Speaker 2: That's what you get for working in a male-dominated field. I think you'll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way. You probably won't be able to change him.
Speaker 1: And her voice like a lark's song?
Speaker 2: Deeper, Softer, None of your twittering larks. I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song.
Speaker 1: Oh, She sings too?
Speaker 2: Constantly. Without doubt, And plays the lute. She has a natural ear.
Speaker 1: What other activities will you have tomorrow?
Speaker 2: Quite a lot. The celebration of the New Year has just started. The first day wesoutherners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast, And people in the North have Jiaozi. Afterward, We will make New Year calls on family relatives, Husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second.
Speaker 1: That's where the shoe pinches.
Speaker 1: Does it make a lot of noise?
Speaker 2: It barks all night long.
Speaker 1: But look at it this way, Every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, For example, They have 1. 4 billion people, Half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.
Speaker 2: Come on, Son, You're looking at this too naively, The Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, And their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.
Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.
Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.
Speaker 1: How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet?
Speaker 2: Maybe it can take effect.
Speaker 1: If I taught you how to do it, I'm sure you could solve it.
Speaker 2: How did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube?
Speaker 1: I didn't really have to figure it out. I just followed the instructions!
Speaker 2: I had no idea there were a set of instructions. I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses!
Speaker 1: Hints are really important when you're solving puzzles. If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game, I'll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube.
Speaker 1: Because you're from a foreign country. The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills.
Speaker 2: It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes, Right?
Speaker 1: You are a smart girl!
Speaker 2: This is going to take more time than I thought.
Speaker 1: Ok. Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM. At 12 AM, Back here for lunch.
Speaker 2: What about the afternoon?
Speaker 1: At 2 PM, Give a presentation here with the press. At four o 'clock sharp, Have dinner with Mr. Smith, Manager of NCC.
Speaker 1: So how do you develop good relationships in the office?
Speaker 2: I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs. If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment, You should be able to get along with most of the people you work with.
Speaker 1: I've heard about that, But I've never tried it.
Speaker 2: You ought to. One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time. A Chat session links you with cappuccinosippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network.
Speaker 1: I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers.
Speaker 2: That's the whole point. All your inhibitions disappear because you can't see the other person. This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn't talk to.
Speaker 1: At least more than 100 years old.
Speaker 2: Let's enter it!
Speaker 1: I can't open the door.
Speaker 2: It must be locked.
Speaker 1: Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.
Speaker 2: She can't answer you.
Speaker 1: She must be deaf.
Speaker 2: It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?
Speaker 1: Frightened? You must be joking.
Speaker 1: Oh, I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet.
Speaker 1: I intend to stay at home for the whole seven days and have a good rest.
Speaker 1: How many days do you plan to finish reading it?
Speaker 2: About more three days, I think.
Speaker 1: Ok. After three days, I will come to you for it.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: Is it true or isn't it?
Speaker 2: Do you want to know something about the American character?
Speaker 1: I just think you're trying to change the subject. But go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, This will help answer your question. In American society boys and girls are raised together. They're not segregated in their activities! Boys and girls go out together from an early age.
Speaker 1: Ok, Go on.
Speaker 1: I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado. But I must admit, This sure is a nice spring day.
Speaker 2: Hey, This spot in the shade looks really comfortable.
Speaker 1: Okay. Hey, Is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I say the weather report last night, And it said the weather should be fine all day.
Speaker 1: I am not picky on food. Just bring me the day menu.
Speaker 1: I have him this semester. What do you think about him?
Speaker 2: He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot, But fortunately, He's an easy grader.
Speaker 1: What did you end up getting?
Speaker 2: I got an A -. Sounds good, But none of my test scores were that high, So I don't know how I got a decent grade.
Speaker 1: That's probably because he grades on a curve.
Speaker 2: Are you enjoying the class so far?
Speaker 1: I hate it and I was about to withdrawal. But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Have you made any good resolutions for this new year?
Speaker 2: Some resolutions? That's a wonderful idea, But I have no idea yet. How about you?
Speaker 1: I want to be healthier this year, So I think I should take more exercise.
Speaker 2: That will be a good one! Anything else?
Speaker 1: Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry, Which is a mess!
Speaker 2: Sounds great!
Speaker 1: Oh, Really? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert, Painting, Handwriting, Reading novels and reading fashion magazines. What about yours?
Speaker 2: I have fewer hobbies than yours. That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting.
Speaker 1: Oh, You can't think like that. We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas. You like taking photos and going to photography shows, Why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable?
Speaker 2: That's a good suggestion. It's fine today. Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset. It must be fantastic.
Speaker 1: I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option. Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing?
Speaker 2: If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered.
Speaker 1: Hummum... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that. Anyway... Now that I'm going to have to make some claims, I think I'd better try and understand how the system works. Would you mind breaking it down for me?
Speaker 2: Sure. Basically we have two insurance policies for employees... Workman's compensation and medical insurance. The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation, And for a significant part of the medical coverage, But you pay part of that premium, Too.
Speaker 1: How may I help you?
Speaker 2: I need to find this newspaper article.
Speaker 1: Have you checked the periodicals section yet?
Speaker 2: I forgot about that section.
Speaker 1: If you'd like, I can show you were to find it.
Speaker 2: Could you do that?
Speaker 1: Follow me.
Speaker 2: Thank you for all your help.
Speaker 1: Wow! What a hit!
Speaker 2: Yeah, He tackled him so hard his helmet came off.
Speaker 1: Is he ok?
Speaker 2: It looks like it, He's getting up.
Speaker 1: I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team.
Speaker 1: We will have a party here, Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Come on, And we will have fun.
Speaker 1: Yes. We'll have our baby soon.
Speaker 2: Oh, Dear, I'm so happy.
Speaker 1: Me, Too.
Speaker 1: I'm in finance. You?
Speaker 2: Really? Me, Too. I work for an accountancy company,T &D. Maybe you've heard of them.
Speaker 1: T &D? Oh, Yes, Sure. How long have you worked there?
Speaker 2: About two years. And you? Are you based here?
Speaker 1: No. Actually, I'm based in Shanghai. I'm just here for the conference. So,T &D eh...
Speaker 1: Wow, You're not kidding. Hold on a second. Hello, Could you give us a hand, Please?
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: I don't want to mark my table, Of course.
Speaker 1: Well, Will you please put them down?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry. I thought you wouldn't come back so early.
Speaker 1: I forgot something on the table.
Speaker 2: Oh, You've got a good memory.
Speaker 1: You can apply for one right now, If you'd like.
Speaker 2: Okay. Let me do that right now.
Speaker 1: Could you fill out this application?
Speaker 2: I'm finished. Here you go.
Speaker 1: Could you please sign the back of the card?
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: Now may I check this book out?
Speaker 1: Hey! I thought you weren't interested! Sorry, I've gotta go! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest.
Speaker 1: Say, Why don't you come with us? We have plenty of room.
Speaker 2: Do you mean it? I'd love to!
Speaker 1: I have told him how to do it several times, But he's never listened to me.
Speaker 2: Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss.
Speaker 1: Oh, I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff.
Speaker 2: Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do, Make sure you don't lose your temper.
Speaker 1: I think that's a bad idea. I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend. How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want?
Speaker 1: There are times of games planned, Should have a grand time.
Speaker 1: Well, Last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party, But I was overdressed. I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt, Blouse, Scarf, And medium heels... You know.
Speaker 2: That sounds just right to me. What was wrong with it?
Speaker 1: Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans. Several of the women had on running shoes. I felt out of place. So I have no idea what to wear tonight.
Speaker 1: There are shills. A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale.
Speaker 2: See? And I bet that's easy to do online. Everybody's anonymous.
Speaker 1: They get higher level English, Which is more formal than everyday spoken English. They also deal with matters of style and creativity.
Speaker 2: Do you mean that a native doesn't make any mistakes in grammar?
Speaker 1: Absolutely not! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes, Especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken.
Speaker 1: Really? That's very good of you, Helen. But I must get a new suitcase, My old one needs repairing.
Speaker 2: You needn't buy one. You can have mine.
Speaker 1: That's very kind of you, Helen. I hope you don't mind my leaving you like this. I need a holiday. It won't be long.
Speaker 2: Don't be silly, John. I'm going with you. It's necessary for me to have a holiday too.
Speaker 1: That's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth?
Speaker 2: Yes, But I don't really use it that often. Have you ever used it?
Speaker 1: No, But I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go.
Speaker 2: Yes, I guess I should try to use it.
Speaker 1: Does it have a camera?
Speaker 2: Of course it does. Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days?
Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.
Speaker 2: You know I often have to work far into the night. I need smoking to keep me awake.
Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed early and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your advice. I'll try it.
Speaker 1: I love swimming and cycling. On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour. In the afternoon, I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours.
Speaker 2: That's great! I think they do you a lot of good. Where do you swim?
Speaker 1: Mostly in the city's swimming pool. But on occasion, I go to the beach with friends. Well, What do you do at leisure?
Speaker 1: He is then in a very difficult situation.
Speaker 2: Sure. He'll get the bag, I think.
Speaker 1: We'll do the seaweed wrap, The jet bath, And the foot massage.
Speaker 2: Ok. Here are your robes. You can go shower first.
Speaker 1: I'Ve got her a birthday present and I'll take a bottle fo wine too.
Speaker 2: That's a good idea. She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks. I think it's going to be a noisy party. I hope her neighbours don't mind too much.
Speaker 1: Helen gets on very well with her neighbours. I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the party too.
Speaker 2: I'm ready looking forward to it. This party is going to be a blast!
Speaker 1: What kind of person do you consider yourself to be?
Speaker 2: I think I'm polite, Careful, Relaxed and shy.
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't think you're shy! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party.
Speaker 2: Well, Yes, But those people always start talking to me. I never talk to them first. Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think. Anyway, You're certainly not shy!
Speaker 1: You're right. I love going out and making new friends.
Speaker 1: What's the time?
Speaker 2: Six thirty, Tonight.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry I can't. Because I have to do some housework. You can ask Jenny to go with you.
Speaker 2: All right. Maybe next time I can go with you. Bye!
Speaker 1: Good bye!
Speaker 1: How can a business maximise revenues?
Speaker 2: You need to invest in some good advertising. You have to know where your potential customers are and target them. It's no good trying to sell computer games to older people. The market is too small.
Speaker 1: What else do you suggest?
Speaker 1: No question about it. He was offside by a mile! We have a goal kick for Ecuador. Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia, He shoots! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.
Speaker 2: Delgado takes the corner. We have a foul! Oh no, Did, The goalkeeper, Has fouled the Ecuadorian player! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick!
Speaker 1: Looks like we both float back and forth. I'm baritone.
Speaker 2: Our bass section is really good. You're going to love singing with them.
Speaker 1: I heard them warming up earlier. You're right.
Speaker 2: It's good to have you in the group. We can always use a good baritone!
Speaker 1: He's after your own heart, It is important.
Speaker 2: So he will make a perfect husband. Make sure you will be here next Monday.
Speaker 1: I promise!
Speaker 1: Lures? We're using live bait over here.
Speaker 2: What kind of live bait are you using? Worms or minnows?
Speaker 1: We're using worms.
Speaker 2: Are you having any luck with the worms?
Speaker 1: No, We haven't even gotten a nibble today.
Speaker 2: That's too bad. Why don't you try using lures instead?
Speaker 1: I would, But I don't have any in my tackle box.
Speaker 2: That's too bad. Well, Where are you fishing?
Speaker 1: What about America? Have you ever been to the United States?
Speaker 2: Actually, I haven't been to the states but I have been to Canada.
Speaker 1: Yeah, My wife likes that one, Too. Personally, I prefer action movies.
Speaker 1: We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees.
Speaker 2: So what does that have to do with this position?
Speaker 1: Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted.
Speaker 2: All under the precept of keeping the funding? That stinks.
Speaker 1: Of course not. You can come to London to visit me in future. And I also will come here if I have a chance.
Speaker 2: I will miss you.
Speaker 1: I will miss you, Too. You're really a good friend.
Speaker 2: It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?
Speaker 2: The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost, But others will continue to be used for generation, Even if English continues to be the dominant language.
Speaker 1: I'd like to, But I can't.
Speaker 2: How come?
Speaker 1: I'Ve a lot of paper work to do right now. I'm behind schedule.
Speaker 2: All right. Can we make it another time?
Speaker 1: Sure, Thanks.
Speaker 2: I'll call you later. Bye.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: I think so, Because most young people like modern dances, Such as rock and roll.
Speaker 2: Oh, Sorry. I don't like them. Why not ask Lily. She likes modern dance.
Speaker 1: Ok, I will. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yes, I want to know about the Normandy Landing.
Speaker 2: Ok. Well, Go to www. Google. Com, And type in Normandy Landing.
Speaker 1: Oh, Wow! There are lot of sites.
Speaker 2: Here, Try this one. It's a good site about Normandy Landing.
Speaker 1: Thanks.
Speaker 2: For detailed information, However, You should read a history book.
Speaker 1: Thanks. If I am interested, I'll go to the library.
Speaker 1: That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays, Isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, You're right. Politicians of all kinds, Religious people, And one or two madmen.
Speaker 1: Well, Are we going there today? I want to take shots there.
Speaker 2: Sure. I can see you're enjoying your trip today.
Speaker 1: Of course. Everything's so striking and fascinating.
Speaker 1: Wow! Isn't that dangerous?
Speaker 2: A little, But the rush was worth it.
Speaker 1: Tell me about it.
Speaker 2: We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us.
Speaker 1: 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, It was scary, But exhilarating.
Speaker 1: I eat dog food when my parents are out.
Speaker 2: We're in the same boat! I'Ve eaten fast food the whole week. I hate it now.
Speaker 1: Poor us! All this junk food lacks nutrition!
Speaker 2: Let'sdine out tonight for a change!
Speaker 1: Good idea!
Speaker 1: What are you talking about, We tried everything!
Speaker 1: Well, It's nice to have a husband like you.
Speaker 1: Goodbye. Thanks again for everything.
Speaker 1: Front, Please.
Speaker 2: Are these seats all right? They're in the second rows.
Speaker 1: Do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows?
Speaker 2: Sorry. We'Ve nothing further back.
Speaker 1: All right. We'll take the second row. By the way, How much is it?
Speaker 2: Thirty yuan.
Speaker 1: Fairly expensive.
Speaker 1: Whatever you prefer.
Speaker 2: This is a very nice place. How long have you been living here now?
Speaker 1: Just over three weeks. Would you like a drink?
Speaker 2: Sure, What do you have?
Speaker 1: I've got white wine, Red wine, Gin and tonics, Ginger ale, Lemonade, Orange juice, And sprite.
Speaker 2: I'll have a glass of red wine please.
Speaker 1: One glass of red wine coming up!
Speaker 1: How long does the rainy season last?
Speaker 2: About two months.
Speaker 1: I can hardly stand these wet and cold days. It seems that it doesn't bother you very much.
Speaker 2: I'm used to this kind of days.
Speaker 1: But I prefer warm weather.
Speaker 2: Spring will come soon. And we will have some pleasant weather then.
Speaker 1: I hope so.
Speaker 1: It's hard for me to imagine. How can you stand that?
Speaker 2: You'll get used to it gradually.
Speaker 1: Oh my God, Don't you know that such living environment is not healthy?
Speaker 2: Yes, We do. That's why we have a cleaning every three months.
Speaker 1: Three months? Incredible!
Speaker 1: Any terrible fines?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Oh really? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying. It's not that bad though, I mean, It is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour. I actually have arachnophobia.
Speaker 2: You're scared of spiders? I actually have two more phobias. Acrophobia and glossophobia.
Speaker 1: I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, But public speaking is not that bad.
Speaker 2: Are you kidding? When I get on stage, My palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: That's great! What time will it start at?
Speaker 1: At 6 o'clock.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll come. See you then.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: See you tonight then.
Speaker 2: Yes. Thank you for inviting me.
Speaker 1: I believe you can do a good job.
Speaker 1: What makes you say that?
Speaker 2: Today, I'm told I failed three courses.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Work harder next term.
Speaker 2: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me.
Speaker 1: Don't loose heart. Everything will be fine.
Speaker 2: I hope so.
Speaker 1: Yes, And the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it? - and his radio didn't work. So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi.
Speaker 2: So what did you do?
Speaker 1: Well, I actually thumbed a lift.
Speaker 1: I didn't pay attention to that.
Speaker 1: English school? What is that?
Speaker 2: This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English.
Speaker 1: Is that different from our school's English course?
Speaker 2: Yes, Before you start your training, They will test you on your English first.
Speaker 1: Is she American?
Speaker 2: No, But she speaks English fluently.
Speaker 1: She's really tall. Do you know her?
Speaker 2: Yes, I know her. We're friends.
Speaker 1: Who's that man standing next to her?
Speaker 2: Which man?
Speaker 1: That short guy on her right. What's his name?
Speaker 2: Oh, That's Matt.
Speaker 1: He's really good looking.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know him?
Speaker 2: I don't know him, But I think my sister does.
Speaker 1: Don't take any chances. It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again. He's already mad at you for last 2 times. Any more and he might fire you.
Speaker 2: You said it. It won't happen again. Do you really think he'd fire me?
Speaker 1: I think he might. You'd better go to his office.
Speaker 2: You are probably right. I'll go right now and apologize. I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic.
Speaker 1: Good luck!
Speaker 1: Is that so?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Take my word for it.
Speaker 1: Hmm... I'd like the cheaper one, Please. Can I pay hy cheque?
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: I wasn't feeling too well, So I stayed at home.
Speaker 1: I'm a bus driver.
Speaker 2: Oh, Do you enjoy it?
Speaker 1: No, I don't really like it. It's boring.
Speaker 1: Travelling, Swimming, Going to the cinema. And you?
Speaker 2: I like painting, Sailing, Watching football and talking to you.
Speaker 1: I like talking to you, Too.
Speaker 2: Do you want to go to an exhibition? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.
Speaker 1: Of course it does. It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You can see a couple who are in love but can't be together because they are so different. And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, Young people that make the movie even more enticing.
Speaker 2: I don't buy into that. I think it's just a fad. Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies!
Speaker 1: You're right. I love going out and making new friends.
Speaker 2: So, You'll be at my birthday party on Friday?
Speaker 1: Of course!
Speaker 1: How long have you been learning it?
Speaker 2: About three years.
Speaker 1: Can you speak any other languages?
Speaker 2: I'm afraid not.
Speaker 1: The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat.
Speaker 2: Why? It's brand new, And it's perfect on you.
Speaker 1: But I bought it to get rid of the heat. Now it does nothing but burning my head.
Speaker 2: Beauty costs, Honey.
Speaker 1: Laugh all you want, Whatever. We need to get out of the heat.
Speaker 2: Walking under the sun is certainly not the way.
Speaker 1: Yes, But they are used for other things, Too. Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris.
Speaker 2: Yes?
Speaker 1: The man asked where we want to go, Then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply. A few moment later, He gave us two tickets.
Speaker 2: Of course, His machine must have been connected to a computer.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 1: I'd rather you typed it.
Speaker 2: Do you want to tell her?
Speaker 1: I'd rather you told her.
Speaker 1: I like spring, Too. We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air.
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 1: I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain.
Speaker 2: It's no big deal.
Speaker 1: I really feel great shame. Let me buy a new one for you.
Speaker 2: Don't be silly, Forget about it.
Speaker 1: You mean she bosses her husband around?
Speaker 2: That's right. She is pretty, But she wants to control everything in his life.
Speaker 1: I guess I'll just have to tell Mr. Robinson that you're too busy every evening – doing God knows what... God don't go on like this. If you absolutely refuse to take her out...
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson's over for dinner on Thursday.
Speaker 1: Look, There are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, Or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before.
Speaker 2: I know, I know. I am really trying, But I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?
Speaker 1: Fine! I want a divorce!
Speaker 1: I suggest you read English texts aloud every day, And try to speak more. That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language.
Speaker 2: Really? I'll have a try. Maybe I will get high marks next time.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know. I tried that. They don't have anything now. So what can I do?
Speaker 2: Well, Since you're a foreign student, It's hard. That's because it's actually illegal for you to work in America.
Speaker 1: I know that. You don't have to tell me that. That's my problem. I know I have the right to work for the university. That's legal. But they don't have a job for me. And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere.
Speaker 2: Anyway, There must be some solution. You know there are many people working illegally in New York.
Speaker 1: Yes, I can.
Speaker 2: Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor.
Speaker 1: I got it.
Speaker 2: If you do get lost, Just ask someone in the building to point the way.
Speaker 1: Thank you, I'll be there.
Speaker 2: If you need to cancel your appointment, Please give me a call!
Speaker 1: Do you think this is a good idea?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Do some children go on to university?
Speaker 2: Yes, They do.
Speaker 1: What examinations do they take first?
Speaker 2: O levels and A levels.
Speaker 1: How long do you usually stay at university?
Speaker 2: Three or four years.
Speaker 1: Oh no! Mike's birthday is a drinkfest for sure!
Speaker 2: Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar!
Speaker 1: Is that why you missed work today?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous. I threw up like five times.
Speaker 1: You're not weak... You're stressed out! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years. Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators... And as you might imagine, That was pretty stressful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, But I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is just about silly paperwork!
Speaker 1: It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?
Speaker 2: There's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, But when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends.
Speaker 1: See you!
Speaker 1: That's what I thought. I just thought I'd ask you and see what you thought of it. Anyway, What did you do yesterday evening?
Speaker 2: Well, It was a warm evening, So I stretched my legs. I walked along the canal for a couple of miles. Actually, Several other people had the same idea. I saw Bill.
Speaker 1: Did you? How is he these days?
Speaker 1: Sure. 3 thirty this afternoon.
Speaker 2: Good. See you later.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Good-bye.
Speaker 1: Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted?
Speaker 2: Probably not. It's off the Internet. What difference does it make?
Speaker 1: Money is no object.
Speaker 2: Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily.
Speaker 1: I will take ten.
Speaker 2: Do you want to add some baby's breath for that? They are equally popular now.
Speaker 1: Of course. Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon?
Speaker 2: Yes, But there is a five dollars delivery charge.
Speaker 1: That's ok. Here is the address.
Speaker 1: It was a good game, But not good enough to watch again. Keep surfing.
Speaker 2: Alright. Hmm, This movie is arerun... I don't know how many times I've seen this show... Commercial again... And a replay of the talk show... Oh no, This show is terrible, You don't wanna watch it.
Speaker 1: Oh, What is it?
Speaker 2: It's a total rip-off of an American reality show, But the imitation is unbearably clumsy.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you just answer my question directly? Why would Chinese answer questions this way? I simply asked if you did it or not. It's a very simple question. And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sorry. I know it bothers you very much. But I don't know why Chinese sometimes would do this.
Speaker 1: You know, Today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him. It's a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don't understand me. The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer.
Speaker 1: Oh, Please. Only once lend your new car to me.
Speaker 1: I disagree. He was polite and informative, And he drove smoothly. One should reward good service.
Speaker 2: I'll sign for dinner and charge it to our room. Let's see. The bill is one hundred dollars. That seems reasonable. How much tip should I leave?
Speaker 1: Remember last month when we were in Europe? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill, So you don't have to leave anything extra.
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot. I'm most grateful.
Speaker 1: Well I hate to tell you this Jen, But both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago.
Speaker 1: Saving money? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons?
Speaker 2: How much? Last week I save $ 10 on food.
Speaker 1: Taylor Smith. But not me. The pallbearers are carrying out the casket. It would be rude to just leave. Let's follow.
Speaker 1: My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!
Speaker 2: Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married?
Speaker 1: If I told her that, She would faint and have me committed!
Speaker 1: Sure. But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters. What do they say?
Speaker 2: They are puzzles. It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival.
Speaker 1: It's interesting and I want to buy one home.
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about this for several months, Well before the Spring Festival holidays.
Speaker 2: And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision?
Speaker 1: Yeah, After receiving my yearly bouns, I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market. I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise. It's unfair.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. With your expertise and experience, You're clearly working below your pay grade.
Speaker 1: That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one.
Speaker 1: Come on. She's like that with everyone.
Speaker 2: I don't think so actually. She never even says \"hello\" to me.
Speaker 1: Oh, What a cool job! How long have you worked there?
Speaker 2: About two years now.
Speaker 1: So his two daughters are my cousins?
Speaker 2: That's right, Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters.
Speaker 1: What are step-sisters?
Speaker 2: Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter. When she was young, Bill's first wife, Sarah's mom died. Three years later Bill married again.
Speaker 1: So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother. Right?
Speaker 2: Yes. She is Sarah's step-mother.
Speaker 1: Take my word for it.
Speaker 2: So what am I going to do?
Speaker 1: Just come to our house and stay over. You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose, 'Good morning!'.
Speaker 2: That sounds like a blue rose! My sitting by his bed?
Speaker 1: Don't be so shy, Lucy.
Speaker 1: Here, See for yourself. That's really strange! It's almost the same as when I...
Speaker 2: Gosh, You're right! It's from some guy named Vic. I wonder who he is...
Speaker 1: Good-bye. Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington.
Speaker 1: I'm going to sweep the floor first.
Speaker 2: Daniel, I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard.
Speaker 1: Stand on the chair, Pig Tom. Use your brain.
Speaker 2: Ok, I've finished cleaning the blackboard.
Speaker 1: How about the podium?
Speaker 2: Oh, I forgot about it. I'll get it.
Speaker 1: Be quick, Please. Our teacher and classmates will come soon.
Speaker 2: I will be done before they come.
Speaker 1: Did you take any pictures?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them?
Speaker 1: Sure, I love looking at photos.
Speaker 2: This one is of my wife and me on the beach, And this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife.
Speaker 1: Your daughter looks like her mother.
Speaker 1: Some people say that history repeats itself.
Speaker 2: What does that mean? The same events never happen twice, Do they?
Speaker 1: The idea is that the people and dates change, But the reason why things happen stay the same.
Speaker 2: I see. I think I'd agree with that statement. People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again.
Speaker 1: I wonder how long this weather can last.
Speaker 2: I hope it will last fineSorrow. I'm going to have a picnic with my family.
Speaker 1: Thank you. By the way, What day is today?
Speaker 2: Today is Friday. Are you new in Beijing?
Speaker 1: Yes, I've just come from the States, Yesterday in fact. I'm still a bit confused about the time.
Speaker 2: Welcome to Beijing. This is my business card. I'm an engineer. If you need any help in Beijing, Just give me a call.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's very nice of you. I don't want to sound pushy, But I still l have one more question.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: I loved it, Too. To tell you the truth, I even dropped tears.
Speaker 2: Actually, Tears also came to my eyes.
Speaker 1: It has got this year's Oscar Award.
Speaker 2: It deserves it. The film gave us a lot of inspiration.
Speaker 1: It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much.
Speaker 2: Yes, People just seem to drift apart.
Speaker 1: Not really. I thought it was disappointing.
Speaker 2: It's a nice cinema, Isn't it?
Speaker 1: Do you think so? I don't like it very much. I found it rather uncomfortable.
Speaker 1: Got it. Can we see any things left by them?
Speaker 2: Definitely. There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain.
Speaker 1: I want to see them. How can I go there?
Speaker 2: That is easy. You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai.
Speaker 1: But I have to go to my homeroom.
Speaker 2: Do we have the same classes today?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Do you think the school can put us in the same homeroom?
Speaker 1: Stop worrying, Mary. You'll do just fine.
Speaker 1: How long will you study there.
Speaker 2: Oh, Maybe three years. I will study and get the master degree first. Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back.
Speaker 1: Which university will you go to?
Speaker 2: Chicago University. My major is Economics.
Speaker 1: Good luck!
Speaker 2: Thank you!
Speaker 1: That's interesting. But it would be really expensive, I suppose. Just think about all the drinks.
Speaker 2: No. If it's your birthday, Then you don't need to pay a cent. Just blow out the candles and open the gifts. That makes the birthday a special day. Your friends will take care of everything.
Speaker 1: Wow. That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: What about in China? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday?
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others.
Speaker 1: That makes you feel uncomfortable?
Speaker 2: Yeah. We never do that in a public office.
Speaker 1: Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy.
Speaker 2: I have felt that. One day when i was in a queue, Reading a newspaper story, The man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding.
Speaker 1: Well, That's not rare. I've seen people reading at others 'newspaper while taking a metro or a bus.
Speaker 1: Sure. 3:30 this afternoon.
Speaker 2: Good. See you later.
Speaker 1: Thank you. Good-bye.
Speaker 1: Did you have to pay a deposit?
Speaker 2: No, But we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months, So for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month.
Speaker 1: Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent?
Speaker 2: No, It's all included. Besides, Students don't have to pay council tax, So we're saving quite bit of money by living here.
Speaker 1: You can't compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them, The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.
Speaker 2: Well, You are right on that point. This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.
Speaker 1: Thank you. I appreciate your help.
Speaker 1: That's Madame Psychic to you.
Speaker 2: I'm waiting...
Speaker 1: Well, You have three hearts — lucky in love tonight. Dress up and go on a date!
Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?
Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor.
Speaker 1: I only paid two dollars for mine.
Speaker 1: The blue SUV in front of the Honda.
Speaker 2: What should I take first?
Speaker 1: That chair over there, But please be careful with it. It was a gift from my mother-in-law.
Speaker 2: Don't worry, I won't drop it. Wow, It's really heavy. I don't think I can move it by myself.
Speaker 1: Let me help you with that. I don't want you to hurt your back.
Speaker 2: Where are you taking all this stuff?
Speaker 1: Didn't I tell you? We're moving to Florida?
Speaker 1: Thank you, But it was your hard work that did it.
Speaker 2: You deserve credit, Too. I've learned so much from You.
Speaker 1: Is he getting better now?
Speaker 2: I think so. Thank you.
Speaker 1: There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.
Speaker 2: I see! Do you want to ask her out?
Speaker 1: Sure, But how?
Speaker 2: You can ask her out for drink after work.
Speaker 1: But for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.
Speaker 2: Then you've got a lot of homework to do. You need to get her notice first.
Speaker 1: Easier said than done.
Speaker 2: You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her.
Speaker 1: The weather is really nice today. Let's walk.
Speaker 2: The weather is good now, But I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon.
Speaker 1: Alright, Then let's take an umbrella. Is your brother coming with us?
Speaker 2: No, He's still sleeping.
Speaker 1: Wow, It's already 10:00 AM. He must have been up late last night.
Speaker 2: Yeah, He didn't come home until 12:00 AM.
Speaker 1: You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot.
Speaker 1: Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.
Speaker 2: Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment.
Speaker 1: Yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, Many Chinese enterprises are going global, And they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business.
Speaker 1: People here always wear the best clothes they have. Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve.
Speaker 2: Any other common customs of your New Year?
Speaker 1: Before the New Year, We always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year. On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a 'Happy New Year'. It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution.
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Isn't that a scary movie?
Speaker 2: How scary can it be? Come on, It'll be fun.
Speaker 1: Ok. I'll give it a try.
Speaker 2: That's the spirit. I'll see you tomorrow after class.
Speaker 1: Ok. See you tomorrow.
Speaker 1: On what days are the classes?
Speaker 2: There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about the other class?
Speaker 2: It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday.
Speaker 1: You're positive that these are the only classes left?
Speaker 2: These two are the only ones.
Speaker 1: The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine.
Speaker 1: What do you think about the teachers?
Speaker 2: To be honest, I liked all of them, Except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, He seem like an old person. He's so boring!
Speaker 1: That's too bad. How was your English teacher?
Speaker 2: She was great. In today's class, She gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to arm for exams, And to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing.
Speaker 1: Where is she from?
Speaker 1: Then why are you hesitating?
Speaker 2: You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships. Last summer, I fell in love with John. But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks, And then wilted.
Speaker 1: One love drives out another. You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship.
Speaker 2: Maybe you are right.
Speaker 1: Yes, He's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, Black hair, And about 30 years old.
Speaker 2: What race is he?
Speaker 1: They didn't say.
Speaker 2: The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
Speaker 1: Of course not. That would be racist.
Speaker 2: But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
Speaker 1: Don't ask me.
Speaker 2: Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, Because that is sexist.
Speaker 1: How many vegetables do you steal today?
Speaker 2: I stole many from Fred's farm, And from yours. I planned to have a dog on farm.
Speaker 1: So funny. By stealing, I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work.
Speaker 2: I could not agree with you more. For us, There are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however, I got lots of fun from stealing.
Speaker 1: I really want to be far away from the reality now.
Speaker 1: Mm — hmm. You met him last summer. He is small and very smart.
Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. I remember Tom. His family comes from Maine, Right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 1: I am. Whatsmore, His wife is 84.
Speaker 2: Is she really?
Speaker 1: Yes, She is. And guess what, He is her sixth husband.
Speaker 2: Really? Quite a woman, Isn't she?
Speaker 1: Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago. She said I just had to pay a late fee.
Speaker 2: She must have been a part-time worker. They didn't have much training. Why didn't you register then?
Speaker 1: She said I couldn't until I had my birth certificate. Here it is.
Speaker 1: You know you didn't.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm telling you now.
Speaker 1: Yes, But you might have told me before.
Speaker 2: I didn't think you'd be interested.
Speaker 1: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?
Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.
Speaker 1: Oh, You men! You're all the same.
Speaker 1: Do you go to the cinema a lot?
Speaker 2: Once a week. Most nights I sit at home and watch telly.
Speaker 1: Do you know what's on tonight by any chance?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry I don't. I never read the papers till I get home.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. By the way, Where are you going for your holidays this year?
Speaker 2: I don't know yet. My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks. She Livesay the sea, You know.
Speaker 1: Oh, Does she? That's convenient.
Speaker 1: Around seven.
Speaker 2: Ok, Great, Should I bring anything?
Speaker 1: No, But thanks for offering, Actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat, Do you have any?
Speaker 2: Sure, I will be happy to bring a few, What is the address?
Speaker 1: Don't worry, I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty.
Speaker 1: I'm fond of history books.
Speaker 2: Oh, The history books are dull to me.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor. Ha-ha...
Speaker 2: Of course! That's why I always say, Eat, Drink and be Greek!
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 2: I think you have a small fever.
Speaker 1: I thought so. I felt dizzy this morning.
Speaker 2: You should've called in sick! Next time, Have either of your parents call the school office.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. I almost forget it. What else?
Speaker 2: The night life there. It's so romantic!
Speaker 1: Oh, Wonderful! How is the weather?
Speaker 2: I went there in August, And it was hot. But I was told autumn is the best season.
Speaker 1: Sounds exciting. I can't wait.
Speaker 1: No, I'm not hungry.
Speaker 2: Well, Let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, But it's fun.
Speaker 1: Yes, There are. They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries.
Speaker 2: The coast of your country is very varied. The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches.
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound too bad. Great for sunbathing! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers. There are cliffs, Then sandy beaches. Then rocks. There are lots of caves in the cliffs.
Speaker 1: What color are her eyes?
Speaker 2: They're dark gray.
Speaker 1: What color is her hair?
Speaker 2: It's blond.
Speaker 1: And how old is she?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, They are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It's difficult and boring.
Speaker 1: It's true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. Once a week.
Speaker 1: Well. Don't forget to perform your duty next time, Ok? Now, Let's start our lesson.
Speaker 1: Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer?
Speaker 2: I could handle everything pretty well in the old position, So I decided to move around and learn something new.
Speaker 1: How's your current job going?
Speaker 2: I'm pretty satisfied with it. I can broaden my experience, Learn lots of new things, And have more development opportunities.
Speaker 1: So I think I may fall in love with her.
Speaker 2: You are attracted to her. That sounds great, But how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love?
Speaker 1: Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love?
Speaker 2: That's a big question. Well, If you are in love, Maybe you'll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all.
Speaker 1: That's what I did.
Speaker 2: And you think about her all the time?
Speaker 1: I'm curious about that.
Speaker 2: But it's none of our business.
Speaker 1: You're great. Could you say it in Chinese?
Speaker 2: Sure, We call it doubt.
Speaker 1: Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper?
Speaker 2: No. Prof. Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology. For once I wish she hadn't given us so much of a choice.
Speaker 1: Well, Why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico. You seem to be interested in that part of the world.
Speaker 2: I am, But there is too much material to cover. I'll be writing forever, And Grant only wants five to seven pages.
Speaker 1: That's not like you to generalize.
Speaker 2: Sorry, You're right. I think you'll be a good politician.
Speaker 1: I think I can do a lot of good for our country.
Speaker 2: You're right. We need more people like you in politics.
Speaker 1: Don't you think you would miss having other people around?
Speaker 1: I took the wrong bus.
Speaker 2: Oh, Did you? That's very easy to do.
Speaker 1: You must have a wonderful time.
Speaker 2: Yes. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Have you traveled much, Luke?
Speaker 1: No, My wife doesn't like traveling. We haven't been traveling for more than ten years. The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married. We spent our honeymoon in the Alps.
Speaker 1: Believe it!
Speaker 2: It looks more like a toy, Or a cool briefcase!
Speaker 1: Some people believe that a tough approach is better. Other prefer a more lenient approach.
Speaker 2: I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly. If most people have similar amounts of money, They will not think of stealing from others.
Speaker 1: Is that all?
Speaker 2: Yes, Just the video.
Speaker 1: May I see your library card?
Speaker 2: Here you go.
Speaker 1: You have to take care of this video.
Speaker 2: Oh, I will.
Speaker 1: You will be fined if you damage it.
Speaker 2: I understand. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Oh, Just on my own. I just joined, So I don't really have any partners.
Speaker 2: Really? Oh, Well, In that case we should play together some time. What's your handicap?
Speaker 1: 16. Yours?
Speaker 2: No kidding! I'm 16, Too. We should definitely play together some time. My name's Bob.
Speaker 1: Jane. Nice to meet you.
Speaker 2: Me too. So, Do you like the course?
Speaker 1: Yes, It's fine. However, I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long, Especially for such a hot climate. Don't they have carts?
Speaker 1: About six years...
Speaker 2: What do you do for a living?
Speaker 1: I manage one of the ski lodges. It's a great job, I can spend a lot of my time outdoors, And I also get to ski for free all season.
Speaker 2: Wow, Talk about job perks! That's great. I would like to do something exciting like that. But I am only an accountant. Not too much excitement there. Huh?
Speaker 1: That's okay. If it weren't for you accountants, Nobody would have the money to go skiing!
Speaker 1: The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, Most countries are tiny.
Speaker 2: I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall.
Speaker 1: Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you.
Speaker 2: The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate.
Speaker 1: Really? You must like tango, Right?
Speaker 2: Oh, It's really beautiful, But I just can't dance it well.
Speaker 1: Don't be so modest. I'm sure you can dance it very well. Let's dance it now.
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll have a try.
Speaker 1: Oh, You dance it so well.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliment.
Speaker 1: I think I'm your lucky fellow.
Speaker 1: It was a round day for me. My family attend the graduation ceremony. I was so nervous. I couldn't find my cap and gown, But all worked out in the end.
Speaker 2: What did you do after graduation?
Speaker 1: I was planning to attend gradate school, But then I was offered a good job doing marketing, So I changed my mind.
Speaker 2: Sounds like you're happy with your decision.
Speaker 1: I sure am. So what about you? How did you feel when you graduated?
Speaker 1: Yes, The chicken looks wonderful!
Speaker 2: How about some salad to go with your chicken?
Speaker 1: Sure, I love salad!
Speaker 2: Would you like to have rice with your chicken?
Speaker 1: Yes, I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken!
Speaker 2: Good! Julie, If you could pass this plate down to Joe, I think we are all set.
Speaker 1: Where did you buy it?
Speaker 2: My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. And he let me pick it out.
Speaker 1: That's so sweet. What was the occasion?
Speaker 2: That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something.
Speaker 1: You're so lucky. If he bought you something for no special day, I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday.
Speaker 2: My birthday is coming up. We'll find out pretty soon.
Speaker 1: What do you want?
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: The World Cup! The first match is today! It's Mexico vs. South Africa! It's going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa.
Speaker 1: I have no idea what you're talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.
Speaker 2: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, Man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, Each g.
Speaker 1: Sounds interesting, But soccer doesn't really appeal to me.
Speaker 1: You? Play badminton? That's unbelievable! You are shorter than a racket.
Speaker 2: Hey, I'm good at playing it.
Speaker 1: Says who?
Speaker 2: My parents.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: How about you, Daniel?
Speaker 1: I'm a real man, And I like football.
Speaker 2: Well, Who is your favorite football player?
Speaker 1: I like Renaldo the most.
Speaker 1: No, I don't know where that is.
Speaker 2: The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be.
Speaker 1: I think I can find it.
Speaker 2: You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.
Speaker 1: Thank you for letting me add your class.
Speaker 1: Around six pm.
Speaker 2: Do you need help setting up or anything? I don't mind. I like to do that kind of thing. It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating.
Speaker 1: No. Thank you. I can handle it, But thanks for the offer.
Speaker 2: Ok, I will see you again.
Speaker 1: Great. I have a good day, Thanks again for the offer.
Speaker 1: Well, The traffic is very loud. I got no sleep last night.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm so sorry, Sir. I'll see what I can do about that.
Speaker 1: In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that. The streets are often icing in the morning. With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms.
Speaker 2: Yeah, We do. In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon. I heard your city has a lot of fog, Is that true?
Speaker 1: We do have a few fog days in winter. But I would not say we have a lot of fogs. The sky are usually clearly in your city, Are they?
Speaker 1: I main marketreasearch, And you?
Speaker 2: I'Ve beaning worked IBM for years. I am vested personnel file system, He is the after sale survise director. He such a nice boss, I like working for him.
Speaker 1: Really? I don't believe I would met him, Is he here now?
Speaker 2: Yes, That's him over there-the taller, Handsome one. Would you let me introduce you?
Speaker 1: Thanks, That's would be lovely. You'r right, He is kind and nice looking.
Speaker 1: She's always bothering me. What should I do?
Speaker 2: You'd better leave her alone.
Speaker 1: But she always harps on me.
Speaker 2: Just tell her off.
Speaker 1: Yes, Great!
Speaker 1: Well, Direct ones are the pollution directly from factories, Refineries waste treatment plants etc., Aren't they?
Speaker 2: Yeah. They are emitted directly into urban water supplies.
Speaker 1: But what about the indirect ones?
Speaker 2: Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater.
Speaker 1: What type of girl is she?
Speaker 2: She is the mature, Stable, Feminine type. I hope one day I can marry her.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's great. You're serious this time.
Speaker 1: I'm Robert, At your service.
Speaker 2: Rita. Nice to meet you.
Speaker 1: Which anti-virus program would you recommend?
Speaker 2: How you tried this one? It's very good and you can download it for free on the internet. You can also download updates for free.
Speaker 1: That sounds very good. Which website should I visit to download it?
Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress.
Speaker 1: I know your feeling. Take it easy and say something to me if you like.
Speaker 2: Oh, Buddy, You are so kind. Thank you!
Speaker 1: Not really, But I've got used to it now.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm going for a trip to New York this autumn. What's the weather like in New York?
Speaker 1: Not quite good. It's windy and dry. We have got continental climate there. It's dry all the year round. Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York.
Speaker 2: Is it cold in autumn there? Should I take any warm clothes with me?
Speaker 1: No, It isn't very cold at that time. You'll only need some light wool clothing with somejackets and shirts.
Speaker 1: Oh, We are the part on the edge of middle. That's all.
Speaker 2: Oh, You know, We are not middle-aged. You're old, And I'm aging.
Speaker 1: Oh, Fool! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the lowsixties. Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this?
Speaker 2: I can if you like.
Speaker 1: Good idea. We should also hold a series of presentations. We could have presentations on the history of the university, The courses we offer, And our links with other universities.
Speaker 2: Good idea! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives.
Speaker 1: We could have another on the successes of graduates from here.
Speaker 1: Where are you from, Sam?
Speaker 2: I'm from England.
Speaker 1: What is your job?
Speaker 2: I'm a bank manager.
Speaker 1: I'm a new student in the school. My name's John.
Speaker 2: Nice to meet you, John.
Speaker 1: It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Green.
Speaker 1: You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now.
Speaker 2: How can we do that?
Speaker 1: You'd probably need a faster processor, To begin with. And you also need a more powerful hard disc, More memory and a faster modem. Do you have a CD-ROM drive?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too, Because most new software programs are coming out on Cds.
Speaker 1: I'm getting a little short on cash. Let's just window shop a little.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: Hey, Jeanine, Get a load of that. It's beautiful.
Speaker 2: Ahahah, And I thought you were tired.
Speaker 1: You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses.
Speaker 2: It sure looks special, Looks expensive too.
Speaker 1: Sure does. Hey, Can I sponge a little cash of you?
Speaker 2: Don't worry, Mary, I've got you covered.
Speaker 1: Well, Only you liked it really, Darling.
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, The harder to make a decision.
Speaker 2: Toss a coin to decide then.
Speaker 1: Why not? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't often use them, I wouldn't really know.
Speaker 1: October 16th.
Speaker 2: Let me see. Yes, We still have some tickets left. Which performance?
Speaker 1: 7:30 p.M. Performance, Please.
Speaker 2: Ok, We have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan.
Speaker 1: I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan, Please.
Speaker 2: All right. May I have you name, Please?
Speaker 1: Du Kun.
Speaker 2: When would you like to collect the tickets?
Speaker 1: We will keep and return it later.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. Then, Can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere?
Speaker 1: You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit.
Speaker 1: I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I will.
Speaker 1: I never thought about it that way.
Speaker 2: I bet you eat a large evening meal, Then sit and watch TV or read a book. Then instead of burning off your energy, Your body stores it as fat.
Speaker 1: Oh doctor, I feel so foolish.
Speaker 2: Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits.
Speaker 1: So many?
Speaker 2: This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs. It depends on your preferences.
Speaker 1: Have you heard of Tiger Woods?
Speaker 2: Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name.
Speaker 1: He had his car stolen. Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car.
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: Well, Apparently, He was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in.
Speaker 2: Crikey. Where did this happen?
Speaker 1: In Taichung, I think.
Speaker 2: Oh, Right, I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there.
Speaker 1: But let me tell you, You're doing just fine. I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German. By the way, How long have you been learning English?
Speaker 2: On and off, For quite a few years.
Speaker 1: Ok, I suppose, But she's had a rough time in the last few years, She got divorced.
Speaker 2: What, From Peter?
Speaker 1: Oh, Of course.
Speaker 1: Alright, Now let's be serious. Actually, You get high marks in the exam.
Speaker 1: What type of movie is that?
Speaker 2: The movie type is drama.
Speaker 1: I can't believe you are watching movies. The weather is great. You should be outside.
Speaker 2: I hate the hot weather. I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner.
Speaker 1: What else do you like to do besides watching movies?
Speaker 2: I like to play computer games, Read books, Go shopping, And play pool.
Speaker 1: Out of those what is your favorite?
Speaker 2: My favorite is to play computer games.
Speaker 1: You're the best!
Speaker 1: I can not agree with you more. And if you are an awful one, That will be funny.
Speaker 2: I remembered Tom is always out of tune. We burst into laughter.
Speaker 1: Is that true? Shall we invite him to join with us?
Speaker 2: So tricky!
Speaker 1: That's true. She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock.
Speaker 1: You said it. You know, They fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.
Speaker 2: Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.
Speaker 1: Definitely. Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon.
Speaker 1: I see you have bought some coffee. Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it?
Speaker 2: Only 2 dollars and 25 cents.
Speaker 1: Usually the host family prepares at least two meals a day for you.
Speaker 2: That is fine.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: What about tonight? Do you have plans tonight?
Speaker 2: No. Did you want to go do something?
Speaker 1: Yes! Yes! I want to take you to dinner.
Speaker 2: Oh! That sounds great! How about six o'clock?
Speaker 1: I'm not really in the mood for Italian, Actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.
Speaker 2: If you want spicy food, Then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road?
Speaker 1: I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, They've westernized their food, So it's not actually that spicy.
Speaker 2: You're right. Most of their dishes have sweet sauces. We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us.
Speaker 1: Oh I still haven't managed to get any tickets. I'd love to see something though.
Speaker 2: Well, Let's go to the marathon tomorrow then! We can just stand by the side of the road.
Speaker 1: What a great idea.
Speaker 1: & you?
Speaker 2: Look, I am playing the piano for you.
Speaker 1: Oh, Thanks. I wanna see the real you.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I have no photo in my computer. And I have no scanner. I will show you later.
Speaker 1: Ok! Before that I'll take this one as you.
Speaker 2: Ha! She is too little.
Speaker 1: Cute, Like you.
Speaker 1: Good. Do you speak English?
Speaker 2: A little. Are you American?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Where are you from?
Speaker 1: I'm from California.
Speaker 2: Nice to meet you.
Speaker 1: Nice to meet you too.
Speaker 1: Do you often go back to see your parents.
Speaker 2: Yes, Almost once a week.
Speaker 1: Jeez, Seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.
Speaker 2: It can be hard, And there are certain sacrifices you have to make.
Speaker 1: Like what? I assume that there's no privacy.
Speaker 1: Then, When do you plan to get married?
Speaker 2: I don't know. It's still up in tha air.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years?
Speaker 2: I've got a letter from my bank here. It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies.
Speaker 1: Could I see that, Please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Here it is.
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound pretty.
Speaker 2: Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Speaker 1: Well, I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends.
Speaker 2: You might want to change your plans. With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow, The roads are going to be rather slippery.
Speaker 1: I suppose I should. I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions. Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Speaker 2: I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon.
Speaker 1: But why do so many people live there?
Speaker 2: Most people grow accustomed to the climate, But there are many others who complain about it all the time.
Speaker 1: Are there any cities where it rains a lot?
Speaker 2: Several. Two good examples are Seattle, In the state of Washington, And Portland, Oregon.
Speaker 1: Tell us about some cold cities.
Speaker 1: You forgot? You...
Speaker 2: Ah, Ah, You promised, And remember?
Speaker 1: That's nice. Where have you been?
Speaker 2: I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco.
Speaker 1: Are you busy now?
Speaker 2: No. Why?
Speaker 1: How about a coffee in that cafe?
Speaker 2: Great. Let's talk over coffee.
Speaker 1: Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker? What about Bob? Everybody loves Bob. Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green, He is a great co-worker.
Speaker 1: That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, They look so cute!
Speaker 2: I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.
Speaker 1: That's all you ever think about, Food! Oh, I think the bride's coming now! She looks gorgeous. Wait, What's she doing? Where's she going?
Speaker 2: Oh great! Does this mean that the reception is canceled?
Speaker 1: Well, Basically if your heart stops pumping blood, Or your lungs stop pumping air, Then we need to get them going again! That's when we have to apply this procedure. Let's begin! I need a volunteer.
Speaker 2: Me! Me!
Speaker 1: Alright, Come here and lay flat on your back. Let's suppose this young woman has stopped breathing. We must lift the person's chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times, Like this.
Speaker 1: I'll say. I knew Sally would finally show her true colors. When she got her final test results back from Mr. Leo, She started yelling at him. You should have heard her. I'Ve never seen anyone get so upset before. To make a long story short, It seems that Mr. Leo failed her because he caught her cheating.
Speaker 2: That's no laughing matter. That means she'll have to take the whole course again. I can't believe she's going to have to start from the beginning.
Speaker 1: It serves her right!
Speaker 1: Exactly!
Speaker 1: The view is breath-taking.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. I really had a good time.
Speaker 2: Well, Thank you for coming.
Speaker 1: So see you.
Speaker 2: Bye.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Why don't you take some aspirin?
Speaker 2: I'Ve already tried some but it didn't help.
Speaker 1: Well, It's necessary for you to see a doctor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I should.
Speaker 1: Well, You'd better get some rest.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Bye.
Speaker 1: Yes, My little Paul is finally a doctor. They grow up so fast you know.
Speaker 2: He is such a handsome guy. He gets his looks from his mother of course!
Speaker 1: What would be the best time for you to help me?
Speaker 2: Tomorrow night would work for me.
Speaker 1: Should we just meet here?
Speaker 2: Ok, And I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation.
Speaker 1: I'll see you then.
Speaker 2: See you tomorrow night.
Speaker 1: Good ideas.
Speaker 1: Even he's not coming back to school anymore, You still can call him and meet him on weekends.
Speaker 2: You're right! I will call him this weekend and meet him.
Speaker 1: No. Edith didn't give anything to drink.
Speaker 2: I'll buy you a drink.
Speaker 1: Oh! Thank you.
Speaker 1: So, Shall we allow three hours to cover the distance?
Speaker 2: Ok. You haven't seen my company car, Have you?
Speaker 1: No. Let me take a look... It's longer than my car.
Speaker 2: I think it's over five meters long. I can't remember exactly. It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour.
Speaker 1: The advertised rate is based on double occupancy.
Speaker 2: When I booked the room, Your staff didn't mention this. And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that.
Speaker 1: Are you quite sure?
Speaker 1: How dare you be so inconsiderate? That's wrong.
Speaker 2: I am awfully sorry. I didn't think you would mind so much.
Speaker 1: Never do that again.
Speaker 2: I promise.
Speaker 1: I am sorry you didn't enjoy it, Sir. I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked. How is your steak this time, Sir?
Speaker 2: Very good. It's done just right this time, Thank you.
Speaker 1: I am glad you enjoy it. I will tell this to the chef. Would you like some more beer?
Speaker 2: Yes, Please give me another Calsberg.
Speaker 1: Can I bring you some dessert?
Speaker 1: Let's not go there, Joanne! Ok, So let's start with the record collection, I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.
Speaker 2: Fine, But I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.
Speaker 1: Woo, Easy.
Speaker 2: Leave me alone!
Speaker 1: What are you so ticked off about?
Speaker 2: I don't want to talk about it.
Speaker 1: Maybe I can help.
Speaker 2: I blew the finally exam.
Speaker 1: You've got to be joking.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not.
Speaker 1: Well, Don't get bend on a ship about it.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. It's for reference only, So it must stay in the library. But you're welcome to look through it.
Speaker 2: Ok. And I'd like to check these books out.
Speaker 1: All right. They're due back next Wednesday.
Speaker 2: Thanks for your help.
Speaker 1: Ok. I'll take it.
Speaker 2: Where would you like to sit?
Speaker 1: Do you have anything in the middle section? I want a good view, But sitting too close hurts my eyes.
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: Sure. Bring enough films, Please.
Speaker 2: I sure will.
Speaker 1: I'd like to wish you every success in your new venture.
Speaker 2: Thank you. I wish I would.
Speaker 1: Good luck to you.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. It's for reference only, So it must stay in the library. But you're welcome to look through it.
Speaker 2: Ok. And I'd like to check these books out.
Speaker 1: All right. They're due back next Wednesday.
Speaker 2: Thanks for your help.
Speaker 1: What about your mother? Did she help you?
Speaker 2: Yes, She did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can't depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That's it. I had to care for them most of the time.
Speaker 1: I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don't know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day.
Speaker 1: What's strange about that! As a person born under the sign of Cancer, I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life. But according to astrology, Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking. They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life.
Speaker 2: Is that so? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology. It's all stereotypes!
Speaker 1: But in my case, The fact matches the theory. Mike is humorous, Energetic, Always as fresh as a daisy, But probably too ambitious. It frightens me!
Speaker 1: What would you do at the party?
Speaker 2: We sing \"Happy Birthday\" at the party and have birthday cakes.
Speaker 1: Do you know when people began to sing the song \"Happy Birthday\"?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Let me tell you the story. In 1892, Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called 'Good Morning to you'. But later someone added the words 'Happy Birthday' to their tune.
Speaker 2: So the 'Happy Birthday' song has been popular since then?
Speaker 1: Yes, Actually, The song has been sung since its publication in 1932. People all over the world have sung it in many different languages.
Speaker 1: I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.
Speaker 2: That would be in our children's section. That book shelf there on the right.
Speaker 1: Ok, I would like to check out these books.
Speaker 1: Don't push your luck, Dave.
Speaker 2: Ok, I'm in. When do I start?
Speaker 1: As soon as you can get here. We'll be waiting for you.
Speaker 1: I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint! You just sit back and relax!
Speaker 1: What does it say?
Speaker 2: I'Ve been accepted!
Speaker 1: Are you serious?
Speaker 2: I'm serious.
Speaker 1: Good for you!
Speaker 2: NyU was my first choice, But UCLA is just fine.
Speaker 1: I'm so proud of you.
Speaker 2: Thanks. I'm proud of myself, Too.
Speaker 1: We really have some movable weather sometime. I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round.
Speaker 2: If it was sunning all year round there would be drought. You probably would not like it either.
Speaker 1: I guess you are right. Maybe I just wish the weather could be a little more predictable.
Speaker 1: The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low. Would you like me to cut them off for you?
Speaker 2: Thank you! That would be very kind of you. I have a saw in the garden shed.
Speaker 1: When the lower branches are removed, You'll be able to sit under the tree.
Speaker 2: Tomorrow, I'll cut the grass. Then the garden will lock perfect.
Speaker 1: Really? I had no idea. Let me check. Yes, It's dead. There's no dial tone.
Speaker 2: So I couldn't get through. I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start. It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater. That's why I'm late.
Speaker 1: But this is terrible. I'm expecting important calls.
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: You know what. The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play. They are supposed to call me this evening. If I don't have a phone. Oh, What can I do?
Speaker 1: So you are watching your weight, Aren't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, To tell you the truth. I am on the diet.
Speaker 1: Goodbye. Hope to see you again next year.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But he just didn't listen.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your compliment. Won't you try this fish with white sauce? I'm rather round of it.
Speaker 2: It's delicious.
Speaker 1: What sort of western food do you like best?
Speaker 2: I like beefsteak very much. Have you tried Chinese dishes?
Speaker 1: I find the Chinese dishes wonderful.
Speaker 1: I think I know where it is.
Speaker 2: Across the courtyard on the right is the office. Follow the signs to the correct line. Is that clear?
Speaker 1: Thank you for your directions. It's clear.
Speaker 2: You can't miss it. Add the class and then come back. We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet.
Speaker 1: That's great. Thank you so much.
Speaker 2: Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!
Speaker 1: I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.
Speaker 2: Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, My country is more agricultural and has much less industry.
Speaker 1: We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, But cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced.
Speaker 1: That's funny, I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside.
Speaker 2: Hey, How could you like to taste my fist?
Speaker 1: Alright, All joking aside, What kinds of moves do you like?
Speaker 2: Um, Let me see, Romance, Comedy. Documentary, Action, Science fiction, Animated and so on.
Speaker 1: That is to say, You like all genres except for horror movies.
Speaker 1: Glad to meet you, Ms. Baker.
Speaker 2: Glad to meet you, Too.
Speaker 1: Where are you from, Ms. Baker?
Speaker 2: I'm from New Zealand.
Speaker 1: What do you do for a living?
Speaker 2: I'm a teacher.
Speaker 1: Thank you for coming, Ms. Baker.
Speaker 1: It's Greek to me.
Speaker 1: I don't know. Never saw him before. Why?
Speaker 2: I think he's the boy who just moved into my apartment building.
Speaker 1: Can you stand?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. It's kind of sore.
Speaker 1: What I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat.
Speaker 2: It's that really necessary?
Speaker 1: It maybe worse than it seems.
Speaker 1: Well, I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms. Anyway, It is all worth, Just think about the cool evening time.
Speaker 1: No, Not yet. But Susan says they'd like to get married in November or December. Then they'll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon.
Speaker 1: By the way, Could you tell me when the film will begin?
Speaker 2: It will begin at 5:30.
Speaker 1: I am afraid I can't be there on time.
Speaker 2: You can see it tomorrow.
Speaker 1: I don't want to miss it today.
Speaker 1: You know, Just giving me lots to do. I'm really busy right now.
Speaker 2: Are you? What are you busy with?
Speaker 1: Oh, Lots of things. Mostly training new people.
Speaker 1: I don't know. The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good.
Speaker 2: If your uncle had an alarm system, Then it wouldn't have happened.
Speaker 1: He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn't stop them from disabling it. And on a crowded street too.
Speaker 2: Didn't anyone stop them?
Speaker 1: You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that. No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen. The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away.
Speaker 1: Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do. It seems that you need this course more than I do. I love my current job. If I take this course, I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work. If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships, That will be great. I need these to improve my current work performance.
Speaker 2: Ok, Then we can sign up for it together.
Speaker 1: Would you like any tea, Dear?
Speaker 2: It doesn't make any difference to me.
Speaker 1: Oh, You're not listening to me.
Speaker 2: Leave me alone.
Speaker 1: You have to pay to use the copier.
Speaker 2: How much do you charge?
Speaker 1: You need to pay ten cents for every copy.
Speaker 2: Is there a maximum number of copies I can make?
Speaker 1: You can make as many copies as you want.
Speaker 2: I'm going to need you to show me how to use the machine.
Speaker 1: There are instructions posted on the copier.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your help.
Speaker 1: Please sit down. Help yourself just like you are at home.
Speaker 2: What would you like to drink?
Speaker 1: A cup of coffee, Please.
Speaker 1: But the traffic is pretty bad.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I hate all this traffic. It's really noisy.
Speaker 1: Listen, It's almostdinnertime. There are lots of restaurant around here. What do you want to try? Italian? Greek? Japanese? Thai?
Speaker 2: I can't stand making decisions. You choose!
Speaker 1: Ok. Let's go American. Where's the nearest McDonald's?
Speaker 1: Wow! It's big! What could it be?
Speaker 2: I'll give you two clues. First, It cost more than $ 250. And second, It's not big, But fat.
Speaker 1: What does that mean, Not big but fat? You didn't buy...
Speaker 1: I have a small family. They are my parents, My younger brother and me.
Speaker 2: I thought you were the only child in the family. Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s?
Speaker 1: Yes, It did. But my parents are ethnic minority people. It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children.
Speaker 2: Interesting. What do you think about families with only one child?
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: We didn't pay attention to the environment, Cut down trees and polluted the air.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things.
Speaker 1: Yes, If that's all right for you.
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure I'll be all right. In fact, I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you. What time are you planning to start?
Speaker 1: Oh, Good. If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock, That would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner.
Speaker 2: That sounds fine. I'll be there around seven.
Speaker 1: Alright. See ya!
Speaker 2: Hold on, With that wind, You're going to catch a cold. Wear this scarf.
Speaker 1: Ok, See you after school...
Speaker 2: Oh... And earmuffs! Put these on... Here we go.
Speaker 1: Mom?
Speaker 2: Yes, Honey...
Speaker 1: I... I can't breathe.
Speaker 1: But... Ok.
Speaker 1: So I take it you two are hitting it off? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor, But what if you break up?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I am not really worried about that. I don't wanna lose before even starting. Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her.
Speaker 1: Sounds like you've got some competition. You made a move already?
Speaker 2: Not yet. But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime. I know some good restaurants nearby.
Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.
Speaker 2: You know I often have to work far into the night. I need smoking to keep me awake.
Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed early and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your advice. I'll try it.
Speaker 1: What's so terrible too, Is the fools we've made of ourselves.
Speaker 2: I hardly dare call the police. They'll just laugh at us.
Speaker 1: I'll never get over it. Oh, Harry, It was all so unnecessary. That man!! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up?
Speaker 2: And his story didn't even hold together. I feel such an idiot.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: I just think the humor was too gross. There were too many disgusting things in it. I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a dirty movie. There wasn't even any nudity.
Speaker 2: No, You're right. But nudity doesn't bother me. What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation, Stuff like that. It was too sick.
Speaker 1: Oh, You are too conservative. It's just realistic.
Speaker 1: Really? Have you ever been there?
Speaker 2: A couple of times.
Speaker 1: Can you go there with me? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me.
Speaker 2: Sure. I'd be very glad to be your tour guide.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Quite right. Gambling broke up a happy family.
Speaker 2: Yeah! Gambling is often a curse. By gambling we lose time and treasure, Two things most precious to a man.
Speaker 1: Besides that, Many people took to gambling and got in over their heads, And gradually ruined themselves.
Speaker 2: In a word, Gambling is a vice. We should be away from it.
Speaker 1: No, I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Remember, It is in the E building on the third floor.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Don't worry, It will work out fine once you get there. I'll see you then.
Speaker 1: I'll see you then.
Speaker 2: Looking forward to meeting with you!
Speaker 1: ' Round 'and' frame 'are two different terms.
Speaker 2: Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this.
Speaker 1: Hey, Slow down. I'll tell you more while playing.
Speaker 1: Fifty times?
Speaker 2: Yes, It was really stupid.
Speaker 1: And how much did it cost to rent it?
Speaker 2: It was fifty dollars for a half-hour.
Speaker 1: Well, That's not too bad then.
Speaker 2: What do you mean? It's expensive!
Speaker 1: Yes, But you have to calculate a little. You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times. So you only spent one dollar per fall. That's cheap.
Speaker 1: One screwdriver, Coming right up. ( He mixes the drink. ) Here you are, Sir.
Speaker 2: Thanks.
Speaker 1: That's normal after a tense work evening. Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either. Once, I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend. That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later.
Speaker 2: Working at weekend is something I hate to do most.
Speaker 1: No wonder you are named shopaholic.
Speaker 2: No, I am not a shopaholic, But a super shopaholic. And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags.
Speaker 1: Wait a moment. And you can check where other sales are.
Speaker 1: Huh? You mean you snuck a peek at his test?
Speaker 2: B :: Come on! I just took a glance.
Speaker 1: Are you crazy? You were cheating.
Speaker 1: That's what my parents want me to do.
Speaker 2: You should take their advice. They know what's best for you. But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun, While I spend all my time doing reading and writing.
Speaker 1: But if you go to university, You'll still have time for fun.
Speaker 2: Hm, What you say makes sense. But you know, I still have to ask my parents for pocket money, And I hate to do so at this age.
Speaker 1: And if you try to find a part-time job, You'll have some money too.
Speaker 1: Yes, But Americans never visit without calling in advance, And they almost never stay overnight.
Speaker 2: I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families.
Speaker 1: I think you're right!
Speaker 1: I think they are too far from the stage. I want two in row 6.
Speaker 2: That's fine. But you have to pay another $ 10.
Speaker 1: Who's winning?
Speaker 2: We are, 27 to 26.
Speaker 1: Really? I thought that they'd been killing us by now.
Speaker 2: How can it be? We are a tough team as well.
Speaker 1: When did you begin to smoke?
Speaker 2: I had my first cigarette when I was 17.
Speaker 1: Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?
Speaker 2: Yes. Twice.
Speaker 1: Well. You know I hate walking, But I can't wait to see your guys' video.
Speaker 1: If it were up to Stanley, We'd have the wedding in the ETV! He loves to sing.
Speaker 2: Then I bet he's really good!
Speaker 1: Well, Uh, I'll let you decide that for yourself. He'll be here a little later. Here's our room!
Speaker 1: Well, You are lucky to have such a considerate husband. Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married.
Speaker 2: He'll come out with surprises. Just wait and see. Look at that woman, With the white chiffon!
Speaker 1: She's chic, Isn't she?
Speaker 2: Yes. I like the dress. It must be the latest fashion. Look, The hem has lowered, And the waist narrowed.
Speaker 1: It makes me feel rather shabby. That woman has a good taste in dressing, I would say.
Speaker 1: I feel terrible, I really didn't mean to knock you over. My tire, Just exploded, And I lost control of my bike. Really, It was an accident. Please accept my apologies.
Speaker 2: Oh, Wait a second, You seem really familiar, I think I know you from somewhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we have met somewhere before. That's right! We met at Aaron's place last weekend! What a coincidence! But anyway, I'm glad to see that you're not too badly hurt, And I should probably get going. I have a nine o 'clock meeting.
Speaker 2: Ouch! My ankle! I think it's broken! You can't just leave me like this! Are you calling an ambulance?
Speaker 1: Nope, I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.
Speaker 1: Do you like my carpet? Be honest! Tell me what you really think.
Speaker 2: To be honest, It looks like your old carpet. Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned?
Speaker 1: I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity, Speed and explosive force like swimming, Field games, Etc.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 1: Do you think we'll make it?
Speaker 2: I guess we'll either make it, Or we won't.
Speaker 1: Let me play it for you.
Speaker 2: Is it easy to locate it?
Speaker 1: It's very easy. Here it is. Ready? Excellent! You are a good singer. You sing the bass so well.
Speaker 2: I used to be a better singer. I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time. It's your turn.
Speaker 1: I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging, First in Chinese then in English.
Speaker 2: That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song.
Speaker 1: Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you?
Speaker 2: Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think.
Speaker 1: Fine.
Speaker 2: It's time to go. Bye, Ella. Hope to see you soon.
Speaker 1: Bye, Jason.
Speaker 1: How many rooms would it have?
Speaker 2: I'd want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each, And one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite. I'd also want a large living room and kitchen connectedt.
Speaker 1: How many bedrooms would your dream home have?
Speaker 2: I'd have one guest bathroom in the basement, One attached to the main bedroom, And one upstairs, So a total of three.
Speaker 1: Yes, Maybe another choice might be better.
Speaker 2: I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains.
Speaker 1: Thank you for thinking of that.
Speaker 2: Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.
Speaker 1: That is a good idea.
Speaker 2: I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.
Speaker 1: I have no idea. Maybe she didn't want to let us..., So...
Speaker 1: I'm sure you have great connections.
Speaker 2: We'd like to open another restaurant... With you as the head chef and manager...
Speaker 1: Really? You have that much faith in me? And Giovanni agreed to it? Does he know who I am?
Speaker 2: Yes. But you know him. He's just worried that you're not Italian...
Speaker 1: He's prejudiced, Isn't he?
Speaker 2: No. He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did.
Speaker 1: Actually me, Too.
Speaker 1: It's not raining, Darling. The bench isn't wet.
Speaker 2: Can't you see a notice on the bench?
Speaker 1: Yes, I can.
Speaker 2: What does the notice say?
Speaker 1: It says 'Wet paint!'.
Speaker 1: They got rice, Flour and oil as presents, While the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card.
Speaker 2: They are not feeling satisfied?
Speaker 1: It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan, And it is no use for them at all, Because they don't cook by themselves.
Speaker 2: But how guilty to waste food!
Speaker 1: Me? Oh, No. In fact, I only took up dancing quite recently.
Speaker 2: Oh, Really? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you say so. You dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got you as a partner.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments. It's just you are a good leader. Do you like the foxtrot and tango?
Speaker 1: Yes. And what dances do you like best?
Speaker 2: Disco is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings, And is a healthy exercise. But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing.
Speaker 1: Maybe he was just visiting someone.
Speaker 2: But you saw how skinny and pale he looks. He has \"cancer patient\" written all over his face.
Speaker 1: Well, Too bad. So, What foreign film won an Oscar in 1993?
Speaker 2: Oh, Please! I have no idea.
Speaker 1: The answer is Belle Opaque. It's a Spanish movie, And the title means The Age of Beauty in English.
Speaker 1: No way. Alisan Darling just got hitched in Vagas.
Speaker 2: No kidding! What happened to Ad?
Speaker 1: Darling found out he was having a fling, And one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too.
Speaker 2: Was, Talk about a double whammy.
Speaker 1: Ya. And now I can break this to you. Fanny is moving.
Speaker 2: Oh, Right. What a load off my mind. I really don't like her.
Speaker 1: Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: I thought you knew where we get off at.
Speaker 2: I wasn't really paying attention. I think we missed our stop.
Speaker 1: Seriously?
Speaker 2: Yeah, We definitely missed our stop.
Speaker 1: That's the last time I get on a bus with you.
Speaker 2: My bad. Sorry!
Speaker 1: Calm down! It is useless to act like that. Can we find some solutions?
Speaker 2: What kind of solution can I have now? I nearly go crazy now.
Speaker 1: But we still have to find one. Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not?
Speaker 2: It seems that I have nothing to do, Except this.
Speaker 1: You're going tore-sell it on eBay Taiwan?
Speaker 2: You bet. Ebay Taiwan doesn't have it! And bidding will start at two thousand NT. This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans...
Speaker 1: I've created a monster... You're a better bayer than me!
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Can't you see the notes here?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry. I can't. What does the note say.
Speaker 1: It says 'No smoking'.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I'm very near sighted.
Speaker 1: Is there anything after the meeting? In that case, Would you add one plan? I want to visit our guest Mr. Ross after the meeting. Can you arrange it for me?
Speaker 1: Which way do we go for the northern line?
Speaker 2: Just go through the number eight to ticket barrier over there. A train will be in directly.
Speaker 1: I appreciate it, Thank you.
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: Oh, No. What did I do? It's asking me for a password.
Speaker 2: Don't worry. See where it says, � New User ”?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Click on that.

Speaker 1: Do you mean the red flowers? They are peony flowers?
Speaker 2: The red and yellow peony flowers are so beautiful.
Speaker 1: Yes, You like them very much. Right?
Speaker 2: Sure. I'm going to take more pictures today.
Speaker 1: I can help you with it.
Speaker 1: Some do, Some don't. Many people in the North are fond of liquors. I think it has something to do with the climate.
Speaker 2: Yes, It has. Some Mexicans are crazy. They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days. Have you ever heard of \"TequilaSauta\"?
Speaker 1: Yes, It's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico. People drink it with salt and lemon.
Speaker 2: Right. It's very strong, Just like alcohol. ( Franksips Mao Tai. ).
Speaker 1: Yes. Please help me reserve it.
Speaker 1: It is ok with me. So I will be arriving at your office around two fifteen PM.
Speaker 2: Yes, There is. See you then.
Speaker 1: Yep, My own special blend! You can tell by just smelling them?
Speaker 2: No, I just read the names off the packages... Ha!
Speaker 1: Ok. I'll go see the doctor.
Speaker 2: Bundle up. It's wet and rainy out there. Here's some soup.
Speaker 1: Chicken soup again?
Speaker 2: Soup does the body good, Sweetie. It's what you need when you're under the weather.
Speaker 1: When can I get it?
Speaker 2: Three days later.
Speaker 1: Thank you, See you then.
Speaker 2: Bye-bye.
Speaker 1: Yes, It has. It went off 30 minutes ago.
Speaker 2: I must have slept right through it.
Speaker 1: Rise and shine, Sleepyhead.
Speaker 2: Just let me sleep five more minutes.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: Oh it's printed the ticket already. Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Great. When in Rome, You guys know what to do.
Speaker 2: We'll sign our signatures, Too. And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers.
Speaker 1: That about does it. See you in a week.
Speaker 1: Yes, We have the free samples for customers. And you can have a try.
Speaker 2: Thank you. We'll order once we try the sample.
Speaker 1: Please wait a moment and fill out the order form. And we'll send you our sample.
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: Don't you like fish then?
Speaker 2: I do, But I want meat.
Speaker 1: Shall we have some white wine then?
Speaker 2: Yes, But I prefer red wine with meat.
Speaker 1: What would you like for dessert?
Speaker 2: I just want to have a coffee, I think.
Speaker 1: Fine, And after dinner, Shall we go to a disco?
Speaker 2: No, Thanks. I'd like to go straight home. I'm very tired.
Speaker 1: I'm sure they are wonderful, But I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost.
Speaker 2: Ah! I get your point. We have just what you need. Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans. The one bedroom apartments are very economical, But their layout makes great use of a small amount of space. I think you can find a very apartment there.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month.
Speaker 1: And after that?
Speaker 2: After that, We'll let you decide if you still want a murder, I mean motorcycle.
Speaker 1: Fine, Thanks. I've been busy lately.
Speaker 2: What have you been doing?
Speaker 1: I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month.
Speaker 2: Really? Good luck for them.
Speaker 1: Thanks. And how are your parents?
Speaker 2: They're both very well, Thanks.
Speaker 1: Where are you going now?
Speaker 1: Yes. Wang Bin.
Speaker 2: Mr Wang, Did you sign any bill in the last two hours in our hotel?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Have you used any hotel services this morning?
Speaker 1: No, I have not.
Speaker 2: Here is your bill. It totals 3250 dollars.
Speaker 1: All right. Can I pay with credit cards?
Speaker 2: What kind of card?
Speaker 1: American Express.
Speaker 1: 0K. See you then.
Speaker 2: Do you have your member card with you?
Speaker 1: Nope, I do not have a membership yet.
Speaker 2: Well I have a guest ticket. You can use it.
Speaker 1: That is so nice of you. If I like the service and the training equipment, I think I well join the club.
Speaker 1: Oh, There comes the bus.
Speaker 1: Well, What do you have in mind?
Speaker 2: How about the Mongolian hot pot?
Speaker 1: Oh, It's too spicy for me. Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb? It was so spicy my eyes teared up!
Speaker 2: Maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time. You can choose the non-spicy soup base.
Speaker 1: Sounds great. Do they serve noodles? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well.
Speaker 2: Yes. The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines.
Speaker 1: The accounts department, I think.
Speaker 2: The accounts department, No problem. I'm just putting you through now.
Speaker 1: What are you looking for in your next job?
Speaker 2: My experience in my last job showed that I have the talent to motivate people. It could be seen from the low absentee rate in my team. I want to continue that kind of contribution and to further develop this potential.
Speaker 1: What is your career objective?
Speaker 2: I want to apply my knowledge and experience to a challenging position and finally move on to management level.
Speaker 1: Speaking of plane tickets, Don't forget to check on the reservations!
Speaker 2: Ok.
Speaker 1: Ok. How about this card then?
Speaker 2: We can take it. Just a moment... Please sign here.
Speaker 1: Yes, It was just when I was walking in the park. I saw some children with a newspaper.
Speaker 2: That happens often these days. Well, Please fill in this Report of Theft.
Speaker 1: I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy because my passport was in the stolen bag.
Speaker 1: What's the kitchen like? I know both you and your wife like to cook.
Speaker 2: That's one of the main reason we chose that particular house. The kitchen and dining room are together. It's really large.
Speaker 1: We haven't. Hurry up!
Speaker 2: All right. Let's go.
Speaker 1: And about time too!
Speaker 1: That's right. They tastes so good! We eat them with mint sauce. Have you every tried them?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have. I tried them when I visited your country last year. I thought they were very tasty. Can you cook them?
Speaker 1: I certainly can. If I can get some from the butcher's, I'll cook them for you.
Speaker 2: That sounds great. I'll bring a bottle of wine.
Speaker 1: Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late?
Speaker 2: Yeah, You did. I just forgot to call.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter, You should have called and let me know.
Speaker 2: That's true. My bad for not calling.
Speaker 1: If you do this again, Don't even bother coming home.
Speaker 2: You're going to kick me out over this?
Speaker 1: Exactly, Maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules.
Speaker 1: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on PowerPoint.
Speaker 2: And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Well, That was some good advice. You made some really good points.
Speaker 1: It will be hard to say good-bye. This office has become like a second home to me.
Speaker 2: My feelings are mixed on the issue too. By helping you I'm losing a valuable and trusted employee. However I think you are taking a step in the right direction.
Speaker 1: No, You needn't do that. You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes.
Speaker 2: But Dad, I should be working full-time at my age. I'm nearly 17.
Speaker 1: You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams. You have to take a job and study.
Speaker 2: What else I'Ve got to do? Join the army?
Speaker 1: Who knows! That might come to later.
Speaker 1: Ok, I've entered my PIN. There are several options on the screen. I guess I just choose which service I want, Don't I?
Speaker 2: Yes. Choose the service you need to use. If you choose to withdraw money, The machine will ask you how much you want.
Speaker 1: I can just enter the amount using the keys, Right?
Speaker 1: I never thought about it that way.
Speaker 2: I bet you eat a large evening meal, Then sit and watch TV or read a book. Then instead of burning off your energy, Your body stores it as fat.
Speaker 1: Oh doctor, I feel so foolish.
Speaker 2: Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits.
Speaker 1: That's not good for me at all. It'll have to be another time.
Speaker 2: We must find some time to read report.
Speaker 1: I know. I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon.
Speaker 2: That's all right. Then see you on Friday afternoon.
Speaker 1: See you.
Speaker 1: I see and what do you do for a living?
Speaker 2: I'm an IT salesman.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a good job.
Speaker 2: It's very interesting actually.

Speaker 1: Patulin will do.
Speaker 2: How many pills for each time?
Speaker 1: Six per day, And two after each meal.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: I think that we should make sure that our looks are the best they can be.
Speaker 2: Right, And what about our friendliness and attitude?
Speaker 1: Yes, And being friendly and having a good attitude also help me relax.
Speaker 2: Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't. What else should I keep in mind?
Speaker 1: When? Tomorrow morning?

Speaker 2: That's all, Thank you.
Speaker 1: Do you have any more skirts in this style? I would like to find a size larger.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry. I think we're out of this skirt in this color. Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there?
Speaker 1: No, That's all right. I'll just look for something else.
Speaker 2: Well, Your refund total is 50 dollars.
Speaker 1: How come?
Speaker 2: I like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
Speaker 1: I feel the same way. It smells so good after it rains.
Speaker 2: I especially love the night air when it rains.
Speaker 1: Really? Why?
Speaker 2: The stars look so much closer after it rains.
Speaker 1: I really want it to rain today.
Speaker 2: Yeah, So do I.
Speaker 1: I prefer strong.
Speaker 1: Nothing serious. The right one needs some air.

Speaker 1: Yes. We have mineral water, Orange juice, Coke, Which do you prefer?
Speaker 2: Orange juice, Please.
Speaker 1: Would you like some ice in your drink?
Speaker 1: That was an odd change of subject.
Speaker 2: Maybe it was, But answer the question.
Speaker 1: No, Not recently.
Speaker 2: I want to go to see a movie this weekend.
Speaker 1: What's stopping you then?
Speaker 2: I don't want to go alone.
Speaker 1: So, Will you be at school tomorrow?
Speaker 2: No, I want to go to the movies instead.
Speaker 1: What's your nationality?
Speaker 2: American.
Speaker 1: What's your relationship with the victim?
Speaker 2: I don't know him.
Speaker 1: Why did you attack the victim?
Speaker 2: Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away.

Speaker 1: How many rooms would it have?
Speaker 2: I'd want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each, And one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite. I'd also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other.
Speaker 1: How many bathrooms would your dream home have?
Speaker 2: I'd have one guest bathroom in the basement, One attached to the main bedroom, And one upstairs, So a total of three.
Speaker 1: It better, Because I'm already late for work.
Speaker 2: I can't stand riding the bus.
Speaker 1: Me too, It's so unreliable.
Speaker 2: That is true.
Speaker 1: It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather.
Speaker 2: Exactly. That's the worst part.
Speaker 1: I think it's time we started driving.
Speaker 2: Yes, I agree.
Speaker 1: Have you received any degrees?

Speaker 1: Is this evening too soon?
Speaker 1: You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot.
Speaker 1: Well, How do you like this one? You will stay there for 17 days.
Speaker 2: It's good. By the way, What kind of clothes do I have to bring with me?

Speaker 2: Let me take this up with the Director and get back to you immediately.
Speaker 1: $ 50.
Speaker 2: How long will it last?
Speaker 1: About 2 years.
Speaker 2: Here is the money.
Speaker 1: I think you deserved this.
Speaker 2: Thank you again. I'll keep doing my best.
Speaker 1: Can I write that down?
Speaker 2: Sure, It's spelled Office and thenD - E - P - O -T. It's in the Yellow Pages.
Speaker 1: Well, We could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper, Go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner, And to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor.
Speaker 2: I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight.
Speaker 1: Fine, We'll do that on the way home, So we don't have to carry it the whole time.
Speaker 1: How many ports do we call at on our passage to Qingdao?
Speaker 2: Four ports.
Speaker 1: The ship is going very fast.
Speaker 2: Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour.
Speaker 1: The sea is calm and peaceful. A sea trip is always enjoyable in fine weather like this.
Speaker 2: Yes. I hope it will remain fine all the way.
Speaker 1: I know, I know. I will do it all by myself.
Speaker 2: Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it?
Speaker 1: Yes. It will cost me about $ 50 a month. And I make a little more than that already.
Speaker 2: Sounds like you've done your homework. I think you're ready for this.
Speaker 1: Faulty products?
Speaker 2: Yes. Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread, You can fix it yourself. So it's a good deal to buy it.
Speaker 1: Oh, That's easy for me. I think it's really a good deal.
Speaker 2: Yes. You can save a lot of money in this way.
Speaker 1: Can you working under pressure?
Speaker 2: Yes, I work well under pressure and find it dimly. However, I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines.
Speaker 1: Are you more a follower or a leader?

Speaker 1: Good luck with school.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Can you read and write English well?
Speaker 2: I can speak the language better than I read and write.
Speaker 1: Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries?
Speaker 2: I think so. I used to be an interpreter.
Speaker 1: Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work?
Speaker 2: The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work. I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, His attitude is great, But he's really unreliable. Sometimes he's really productive, But then other times... Take last Tuesday for instance, He was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting!
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason...
Speaker 1: But that's not the only thing... You know, He really doesn't have the best work ethic, I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients.
Speaker 1: $ 79 a night.

Speaker 1: What does MM / DD / YY mean?
Speaker 2: That means Month / Day / Year. Use numbers.
Speaker 1: I don't understand.
Speaker 2: For example, If your birth date is January 12, 1987, Write 01/12 /8 7.
Speaker 1: Oh. That's simple enough.
Speaker 2: Always print clearly, And fill in the bubbles completely.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 1: But I don't like them. It's not fair.
Speaker 2: You can have some fruits for dessert. If you eat an apple and a banana, I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake.
Speaker 1: Ok, Actually I don't mind eating peas and carrots. But I hate broccoli and cauliflower.
Speaker 2: I'll remember that for next time. You'll get extra peas and carrots, But no broccoli or cauliflower, Ok?
Speaker 1: Thanks, Mom!
Speaker 1: Ok. Can I have your name, Please?

Speaker 1: Do they pay you a lot?
Speaker 2: They pay well enough.
Speaker 1: Tony Bush.
Speaker 2: Pls wait a minute, Let me check. Excuse me, But I can't seem to find your name on our list. Are you sure you have a reservation for tonight?
Speaker 1: Of course, I did it myself.
Speaker 2: I am terribly sorry. There must have been some mistakes. Let me check it again. Oh, Yes, There is a name listed as Tommy Bush. It must be the fault of the clerk who registered your name. I apologize.
Speaker 1: Don't worry about that.
Speaker 2: According to the records, Your reservation is for a single room with shower and air conditioners for two nights. The room rate will be 110 dollars per night, Including 10 % tax and 4 % service charge. Is this right?
Speaker 1: Great. I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries.
Speaker 2: But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions. You can get much information about environment of investment.
Speaker 1: I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that.
Speaker 2: I'll be worried if you stay out late.
Speaker 1: Okay, How about a midnight curfew? And I'll let you know where I am.
Speaker 1: Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym?
Speaker 2: Sir, You can use the gym for free. All you need is your room key.
Speaker 1: Great! Now tell me, What are the hours of this gym?
Speaker 2: Sir, Our gym is open around the clock, Every day of the week.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a trainer to help me work out?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Sir, But we have no trainer.
Speaker 1: That must be a very interesting job.
Speaker 2: It is. You must be new here. I do my shopping here regularly, Once a week.
Speaker 1: Do you? Nice to meet you! And here is the invoice and your change.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Nice to meet you, Too.
Speaker 1: Which bus goes there?
Speaker 2: You may take a No. 34 bus. And the subway can also take you there.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: And I've checked the orders.
Speaker 2: I'm very impressed.
Speaker 1: And I've ordered the supplies.
Speaker 2: Congratulations. You should be very proud of yourself.
Speaker 1: Is it a very long bus ride?
Speaker 2: It's about thirty minutes long.
Speaker 1: Do you know where we get off at?
Speaker 2: There's a bus stop right behind Macy's.
Speaker 1: Really, There's a bus stop right by the mall?
Speaker 2: There's a bus stop in the mall parking lot.
Speaker 1: That's convenient.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Oh, No! Did you call the police?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: My English isn't very good. I didn't know what to say to them.
Speaker 1: I'm going to give you some advice, Jone. If this happens again, You should call the police immediately. You should try to remember everything. You should explain everything to the police.
Speaker 1: Well, The same as for private vehicles really, But we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear.
Speaker 2: Can you carry out major repairs here?
Speaker 1: Yes, We've got all the necessary equipment. We can give the engines a major overhaul. If there's a serious problem, We strip down the engine and find the faulty component. Would you like to look around?
Speaker 1: Should we have gotten off the bus already?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: I thought you knew.
Speaker 2: Maybe we did miss our stop.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I'm positive that we missed our stop.
Speaker 1: I'm never catching the bus with you again.
Speaker 2: My mistake.
Speaker 1: No, You needn't do that. You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes.
Speaker 2: But Dad, I should be working full-time at my age. I'm nearly 17.
Speaker 1: You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams. You have to take a job and study.
Speaker 2: What else I've got to do? Join the army?
Speaker 1: Who knows! That might come to later.
Speaker 1: That's too bad, But the porterhouse will be okay.
Speaker 2: May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?
Speaker 1: Not tonight, Thank you.
Speaker 2: No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, If that's okay.
Speaker 1: Charge it to whatever account you like.
Speaker 2: Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!
Speaker 1: How is oil supposed to make you relax?
Speaker 2: They all have essence of flowers in them.
Speaker 1: Mmmm. They smell nice.
Speaker 1: Where do we begin?
Speaker 2: We start at the top with our name and contact information. Make sure the information is current.
Speaker 1: Then what do we do?
Speaker 2: Put your job experience first, If that is more impressive than your education.
Speaker 1: What about listing my interests and affiliations next?
Speaker 2: Yes, That would make a good ending for your resume.
Speaker 1: You must tell the embassy about it. And I think they'll issue you with a new one.
Speaker 2: I'd better go tomorrow.
Speaker 1: No. But you mustn't leave it too long. Did you report it the police?
Speaker 2: No. I couldn't find a policeman.
Speaker 1: Well. You must report that it's been stolen. And give the police description of your bag. You'd better go to the local police station tomorrow morning.
Speaker 1: Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use?
Speaker 2: No, Sir. There's no extra charge. All you need is your room key to open the door.
Speaker 1: And the gym hours are?
Speaker 2: Sir, You'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes.
Speaker 1: One more question, Do you have a trainer?
Speaker 2: We might be getting one in the near future. But at the present time, No.
Speaker 1: Oh, Daddy, You should do more exercise. You are getting a little heavy.
Speaker 2: I am afraid you are right. Recently, Even going upstairs makes me out of breath.
Speaker 1: Then go climbing with me, Daddy. Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes.
Speaker 2: Terrific! It is also a good exercise to keep me fit.
Speaker 1: I give you my word, You must feel refreshed after mountain climbing.
Speaker 2: Ok, I'll go.
Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.
Speaker 2: I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.
Speaker 1: I will bring it up over Sunday brunch.
Speaker 1: You'Ve got a great personality.
Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments. I will try even harder to repay the company and your support.
Speaker 1: I believe you will. I'm very pleased with your work. Your promotion will contribute to the development of the company.
Speaker 2: Thanks for saying so.
Speaker 1: Ok, I have the number. Bye!
Speaker 1: And Tom, You will help Johnny with his homework, Won't you?
Speaker 2: I'll see. I will if I can but I won't promise.
Speaker 1: But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you?
Speaker 2: Yes. But only if you ask me nicely.
Speaker 1: Tom, Darling. You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you? Please!
Speaker 2: Ok. I'll keep my promise.
Speaker 1: No. This is my first time to buy some. You can see that its historical price data is rising now.
Speaker 2: But that is a little risky, You know.
Speaker 1: Hey! Do you still remember our teacher of economics, Mr. Locker?
Speaker 2: Of course! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst.
Speaker 1: I can ask for some advice from him.
Speaker 1: I'm fine, Thanks. How is Tony?
Speaker 2: He's fine, Thanks. How's Emma?
Speaker 1: She's very well, Too, Helen. Goodbye, Helen. Nice to see you.
Speaker 2: Nice to see you, Too, Steven. Goodbye.
Speaker 1: Did someone get hurt?
Speaker 2: A driver died instantly. The other one was badly hurt. A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too.
Speaker 1: What a terrible accident! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident?
Speaker 2: I think both. They drove too fast. What's worse, One of them was drunk.
Speaker 1: Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk?
Speaker 1: Yes, I had a look just now, I feel we can do a lot of business in this line.
Speaker 2: Sure, We can. You know, We are been in the line for more than twenty years, And I think our price are competitive comparing with those in the world market.
Speaker 1: As you know, Miss Wang, We are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good English skills. We looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Today's interview is for us to get to know a little about you. And the interview will last a little bit longer. So, If you're comfortable, I want to ask you some questions.
Speaker 1: Well, I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town. Do you have another suggestion?
Speaker 2: Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant. Plus, They have live jazz.
Speaker 1: Gramercy Tavern, Eh? I think I've heard of that before. Call to get us a table, Okay?
Speaker 2: Right away, Sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge.
Speaker 1: No, I'm afraid not.
Speaker 2: We might have cancellations. Could you call us again some other day?
Speaker 1: Sure, But if you do have any cancellations, Could you let me know as soon as possible?
Speaker 2: I'm very sorry, Sir, But we are unable to do that. We would appreciate it very much if you could call us instead.
Speaker 1: Ok, Thanks.
Speaker 1: Yes, We do. What size do you want?
Speaker 2: Size one. By the way, What if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn't like it?
Speaker 1: Well, You can always bring it back to us for a full refund.
Speaker 2: All right. Could I have it gift-wrapped, Please?
Speaker 1: That's good.
Speaker 2: I am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid.
Speaker 1: You should very qualified.
Speaker 2: Thank you. It has always been my dream to be a stewardess.
Speaker 1: Sorry, Just a moment. The name is Caxton...
Speaker 2: No, It's Caxton.
Speaker 1: Fine, I've got that. And your company is...
Speaker 2: Rosedale Investments.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that, Please?
Speaker 2: It's R, O,S, E,D, A, L, E.
Speaker 1: Thank you. And the message?
Speaker 1: No, It is not here. Damn it! I'm going to have to buy another ticket.
Speaker 2: Let's go to the inquiry desk first to check whether anyone has got it and turned it in.
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea, Except I want to go out, Not stay in. Something else, Maybe?
Speaker 2: Well, How about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, With great food and music.
Speaker 1: That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?
Speaker 2: Of course, Sir. You've made a good choice.
Speaker 1: There are other things I need to take care of.
Speaker 2: What is it that you need to do?
Speaker 1: Please don't be nosey.
Speaker 2: I'm not being nosey, It's just a question.
Speaker 1: You don't need to worry about that.
Speaker 2: That was mean to say.
Speaker 1: I am very sorry, But I must go.
Speaker 2: I guess.
Speaker 1: I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, Even during office hours, I wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.
Speaker 2: Other company rules also need your attention.
Speaker 1: Like this one?
Speaker 1: You are allowed an additional two carry-on items.
Speaker 2: Good, I have my backpack and my camera tripod.
Speaker 1: I see. All carry-on items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin.
Speaker 2: Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin.
Speaker 1: You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items.
Speaker 2: I cannot let anything happen to that tripod. Can you guarantee it will not be damaged if I check it in?
Speaker 1: I talked with the manager over the phone and he told me I can have itreissued because I have a copy of my lost ticket.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see. I'll call the manager, Then.
Speaker 1: Would you like to order now or wait for a while?
Speaker 2: Bring me the menu, Please.
Speaker 1: Okay. How much?
Speaker 2: Well, A 15 - inch Pro is $ 2, 100.
Speaker 1: Oh, That sounds great. I'll take it.
Speaker 2: Great. How would you like to pay for it?
Speaker 1: Here's my VISA.
Speaker 2: Let me ring you up. Okay, Sign here, Please.
Speaker 1: Everything I need is in this box?
Speaker 2: It'll take her only a few minutes to get online.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your help.
Speaker 2: So long. Thank you for shopping here.
Speaker 1: What are you talking about, We've tried everything!
Speaker 1: Everything, Sir, Including the air tickets, Accommodation and gate tickets.
Speaker 2: Ok, I will take the tour.
Speaker 1: Yes, I want to see it.
Speaker 2: How about today at 6 p.M.?
Speaker 1: That time is okay with me.
Speaker 2: Very good. We'll meet at 6. Do you need directions?
Speaker 1: No, Thank you. I go by there on my way to work.
Speaker 2: If you're interested, You can fill out an application form.
Speaker 1: That's a good idea. Do I need to bring anything myself?
Speaker 2: No. The only thing I need to see is your driver's license.
Speaker 1: That's true, But my supervisor is very dishonest. There's no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth. I'm sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault, And there's nothing I can do about tha.
Speaker 2: Let's think realistically about what might happen. How much money do you have in your savings?
Speaker 1: I have enough to live off of for about 3 months. But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living! I'd rather invest my money somehow.
Speaker 1: The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things.
Speaker 2: I see, Actually the hardware is the easy part, I do want to study how to use the software.
Speaker 1: Right you are, Paler, And since what you want to learn is how to use software, We should also learn to refer to the computer menus.
Speaker 1: Ok, I'll look out for it. Sorry, I can't talk now.
Speaker 1: Mr Jurgen, Yes, The remittance has been successful.
Speaker 2: That was quick! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly. Yes, That is good news. The full amount should be 20, 000 Euros, Is that right? I'd like to withdraw 5, 000 Euros worth of local currency, If that's possible.
Speaker 1: Not a problem, Sir. Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport.
Speaker 1: If I let you go back to sleep, I know that you won't get up in five minutes.
Speaker 2: Trust me. I'm going to wake up.
Speaker 1: You have a lot to get done this morning.
Speaker 2: I already know, And I'll take care of all that when I wake up.
Speaker 1: I want you to be on time for school today.
Speaker 2: I'll make it to school on time. Don't worry.
Speaker 1: Yep. See how long and curly my lashes are?
Speaker 2: They look fake.
Speaker 1: Thanks!
Speaker 1: Why didn't she call me?
Speaker 2: She tried, But the line is always busy.
Speaker 1: Well, I may have stayed on the phone too long. Can you give me her number? I'll call her later.
Speaker 2: Of course. It's 555-4653.
Speaker 1: Thanks. So how are things with you?
Speaker 1: By who?
Speaker 2: Some guy on the street just mugged me.
Speaker 1: Are you hurt?
Speaker 2: No, He just stole all of my things.
Speaker 1: That's crazy.
Speaker 2: I need to go to the police station.
Speaker 1: Do you want me to take you?
Speaker 2: That would be great. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Let me see. En .. it's right now. You can try it.
Speaker 2: Wonderfull. Thanks a lot.
Speaker 1: You are welcome.
Speaker 1: Actually, I haven't had time to look it over. Did you bring another copy with you?
Speaker 2: Of course, Here you are, Sir.
Speaker 1: Call me Mr. Smith.
Speaker 2: Certainly, It would be my pleasure, Mr. Smith.
Speaker 1: Ok, Got it.
Speaker 2: What is your father doing now?
Speaker 1: Reading newspaper on the couch.
Speaker 2: How about Daniel?
Speaker 1: Staying with Ultraman, Of course. You know he likes it very much.
Speaker 2: Be careful of the peeler. Don't cut your fingers.
Speaker 1: I will.
Speaker 2: Ok, We've finished. Can you get your father and brother?
Speaker 1: Mine isn't hard, But it's not interesting.
Speaker 2: What do you do then?
Speaker 1: I'm a clerk in a shop.
Speaker 1: Anything to get me up and running.
Speaker 2: For starters, We have a computer lab.
Speaker 1: Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?
Speaker 2: The lab is completely free. But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing.
Speaker 1: That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives.
Speaker 2: Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby. We're set up for wireless right here.
Speaker 1: This can't be the right stop.
Speaker 2: I don't think this is right.
Speaker 1: We got off too early, Didn't we?
Speaker 2: Yeah, We did get off too early.
Speaker 1: I should've just stayed on the bus.
Speaker 2: I messed up.
Speaker 1: Great, We have to walk now.
Speaker 2: You want to wait for the next bus?
Speaker 1: ( after a while... ) Where's the patient?
Speaker 2: He's there in the room. He's very ill.
Speaker 1: Don't worry. We'll put him in the stretcher. You are coming with us? Step in please.
Speaker 2: Carry him into the emergency ward. Here we are.
Speaker 1: Help the patient bathe and change his clothes, Nurse. Then bring him into the operating room.
Speaker 1: Of course. The fitting room is right over there.
Speaker 2: Do you have a medium in the same color? This one is a little tight.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. All the back of that size are sold out. Would you like a red one?
Speaker 2: Ok, Let me try it on. What do you think?
Speaker 1: Oh, That suits you very well. Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck.
Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Shall we go there on foot? It's very near.
Speaker 2: Ok, Let's go.
Speaker 1: Smoke is coming out of his car! He seems to be having engine trouble! He makes his way into the pit, And Fernando Alonso takes the lead!
Speaker 1: Well, First, I'd like to buy a few postcards. My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere. I want to do that, Too.
Speaker 2: We have plenty of postcards to choose from here. The same designs can be found on these posters.
Speaker 1: Posters are difficult to travel with. I think I'll just buy the postcards. I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice.
Speaker 2: Yes, We do. They're on the wall behind you.
Speaker 1: Just look at the screen here. It'll give you prompts, You see? Now you need to enter your PIN number, Then press 'enter' to confirm it.
Speaker 2: Then it'll give me my money?
Speaker 1: Not right away, You need to decide what it is you want to do. The next thing is to select the service.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Are you serious?
Speaker 2: I'm telling you the truth.
Speaker 1: Did anyone get hurt?
Speaker 2: Two people were injured.
Speaker 1: Are they going to be okay?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Well, That's a miracle that no one was killed.
Speaker 2: Yes, They were lucky.
Speaker 1: Very good. Anything else?
Speaker 2: My advantage is that I have strong sense of responsibility. But I lack patience.
Speaker 1: I must praise you for your modesty and diligence. What's your plan next?
Speaker 2: I will listen and learn more when I start my new job. I plan to become more professional in my field.
Speaker 1: I see. How long will you need it?
Speaker 2: About a week.
Speaker 1: Just a moment, Please.
Speaker 1: Thanks for helping me.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Of what?
Speaker 2: Afraid of making a mistake.
Speaker 1: No mistakes in a tango Donar. Not like life, Simple, That will make the tango so great. If you make a mistake, You'll get all tango done. Just tango along. Why don't you try? Will you try it.
Speaker 2: All right. I'll give it a try.
Speaker 1: Just a few Christmas gifts, To this season, After all!
Speaker 2: Don't take that tone with me. Do you have an invoice for these items?
Speaker 1: Umm... No... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole!
Speaker 2: You are under arrest, Sir. You have the right to remain silent. You better not pout, You better not cry. Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney, If you cannot afford one, The state will appoint one for you.
Speaker 1: Everybody gets men ties for Christmas. It's too boring. Everybody buys either ties or sweaters. I want a more unique gift.
Speaker 2: Well, You can buy him a pet iguana then.
Speaker 1: That's a cool idea. At least it would be a surprise. But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it.
Speaker 2: He would think you were crazy, Caroline.
Speaker 1: Yes. An iguana is too strange for a gift, And a tie is too normal. So I have to find something halfway between.
Speaker 2: How much do you want to spend?
Speaker 1: Did the chairman ask for me?
Speaker 2: Yes, I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend.
Speaker 1: All right. Have you handed in my report to him?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did. Besides, Here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting. I think you'll have to do some replies.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Anne. You've done an excellent job. Did they mention the date for the next meeting?
Speaker 1: I'll call again in thirty minutes.
Speaker 1: So, What did you get them?
Speaker 1: 1999.
Speaker 2: How about the mileage?
Speaker 1: 6, 000 miles, All highway mileage.
Speaker 2: What do you mean 7B.
Speaker 1: Highway miles are not as bad as local miles. They do not hurt car as much.
Speaker 2: Oh, Why such a high mileage?
Speaker 1: The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line.
Speaker 2: Okay. Does this car have a warranty?
Speaker 1: One month.
Speaker 2: How do I make sure I am not buying a junk?
Speaker 1: Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared, Delicious, And very palatable. They are very good in colour, Flavour, And taste.
Speaker 2: Mr. Liu, Would you care for another helping?
Speaker 1: No kidding. We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups.
Speaker 1: Of course. Do you have your passport with you? How much would you like to purchase?
Speaker 2: 5, 000 Euros will be sufficient, Thanks.
Speaker 1: Please fill in this form. How would you like it? In 100 Euro cheques?
Speaker 2: That would be perfect, Thank you.
Speaker 1: How much is that?
Speaker 2: You have to maintain a minimum balance of $ 100.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes, Really.
Speaker 1: What if I can't meet that requirement?
Speaker 2: You will be fined.
Speaker 1: How much is the fine?
Speaker 2: It's going to cost you $ 25.
Speaker 1: I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow!
Speaker 2: If you're so hungry, Why don't you ask someone else for money?
Speaker 1: I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess on Friday, Then you can eat.
Speaker 1: That's pretty messed up.
Speaker 2: Why don't you just go home and eat?
Speaker 1: I don't want to go all the way home just to eat.
Speaker 1: Stirred or shaken?
Speaker 2: Stirred will be fine.
Speaker 1: Here you are.
Speaker 2: Thanks. Does the bar have a signature drink?
Speaker 1: Sure. All of our mixed drinks are excellent. You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail.
Speaker 2: Can you recommend one?
Speaker 1: Try a Singer. It has lime juice and grenadine over ice.
Speaker 2: It sounds interesting. I'll take one.
Speaker 1: Can I pay with traveler's check?
Speaker 2: Sure. Can I have your passport, Please?
Speaker 1: Here you are.
Speaker 2: Thanks. Are you satisfied with your stay here with us, Sir?
Speaker 1: Very much. The room is cozy and the service is jolly good. By the way, Could you deliver my luggage to the airport in advance?
Speaker 2: Sure. It will be taken care of, Sir. Which flight do you take?
Speaker 1: Flight 17. And my luggage should be delivered there by 4 o'clock.
Speaker 1: Very useful advice, I will try them right now.
Speaker 1: My boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day, So I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time.
Speaker 2: It was nice of your boss to give you an option. My boss would never do that.
Speaker 1: Let's get back to you. How was your day?
Speaker 2: It was horrible! It was just one thing after another.
Speaker 1: You look pretty upset. Are you ok?
Speaker 1: But journalism, It is a very different profession from administration. You know a lot about administration. Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers?
Speaker 2: I study the administration. Yes. But I'm more attracted to writing articles. I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news.
Speaker 1: A new reporter must expect to work many hours.
Speaker 2: I know that starting reporters work many hours. I'm very willing to take on the challenge.
Speaker 1: There is mildew.
Speaker 2: I'll go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe.
Speaker 1: Why can't I call someone to fix it today?
Speaker 2: I'll just do it myself.
Speaker 1: I need it done today.
Speaker 2: You're right about that.
Speaker 1: Are you okay with me calling a plumber?
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Please fetch me a glass of water. Thanks.
Speaker 2: You are welcome.
