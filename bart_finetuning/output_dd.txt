Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely, that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent.   That would be great! Is it expensive? 
prediction: 
 Not at all! It ’ s only about fifteen dollars an hour.

 Let ’ s see... I would say about eight hundred dollars.

Good evening, Saliva. What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen? What are you doing now?   I am cooking now!   Are you good at cooking?   I have studied its skills recently at a training school. I plan to run a restaurant, so I have to practise cooking!   It is a good idea. What dish are you cooking now?!   I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker. Have you ever tried steamed fish?   Yes, I have. But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious. The fish is not well-done and too salty.   That's the case. I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much.   I have the same idea as yours.   It's OK. Please have a taste of it.   Thank you. Oh, it's very delicious.   Thank you for your praise.   Besides steamed fish, what else are you good at cooking?   I am good at stewing beef with potato, frying chicken, hot and sour soup etc.

Hi, George. I'm going to have a job interview next week. Could you give me some advice?   Sure. First of all, it ’ s very important for you not to be late. Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic.   Yeah, that's very important.   So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment.   I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer.   That ’ s right. You need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes.   It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it.   It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression. For example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications. 
prediction: 
 That ’ s good advice. I ’ ll try my best.

Hi, George. I'm going to have a job interview next week. Could you give me some advice?   Sure. First of all, it ’ s very important for you not to be late. Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic.   Yeah, that's very important.   So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment.   I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer.   That ’ s right. You need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes.   It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it.   It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression. For example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications.   But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans.   I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes.   It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes.   You misunderstood me. Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job, or that you are snobbish or frivolous.   I know what you mean. I ought to wear right clothes at the right time.   You got it. Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement. 
prediction: 
 I ’ ll try my best.

 It seems that'clothes make the man '.

Hey, you look great! how's everything?   Yeah, you know what? I've been going to the club regularly. The training really pays off. Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit.   Really? tell me about it. I haven't gone to the club for a long time. I am too busy with work.   It's important to do proper exercises.   You're right. Too much or too little won't do any good.   The trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, I should also have a healthy and balanced diet.   Sounds reasonable.   We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic.

The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest.   Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much? The same is true in the West.   No, absolutely not! On the contrary, you'll be considered a well-connected, sociable man, if you keep involved in the conversation all the time. But always pay attention to what you say. If the table has a senior guest, say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible. Or maybe, you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested.   You mean, keeping a low profile in the presence of the old? That goes in like with Confucius'preachings, right?

I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go.   they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood.   they're also one of the richest couples. They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want.   I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars.   did either one of them win an Oscar this year?   I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films, but I don't think he won anything.   Tom Cruise may be handsome, but I think he's a bit crazy, don't you?   yes, his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous.   I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves.   people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated.

Hello. Nice to see you again. I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery. I hope everything ’ s OK.   Yes, fine. I had something wrong with my stomach. I won ’ t go into detail, but it wasn ’ t serious.   I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital.   I think most people are a little nervous about it. I was really very, very nervous just before I had the operation, but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation.   It must have really hurt afterwards.   Well, the nurse game me plenty of painkillers, but it did feel uncomfortable. I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours. That was the worse thing.

 That ’ s terrible. Did you have to stay in hospital for long

Did you get any questions about him?   I only had 1 question about him. But you might get more. I dont know if he will have the same exam or not.   Hopefully he will use the same exam, cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war. It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class.

That ’ s why you have the reservation.   I know why we have reservations.   I don ’ t think you do.If you did, I ’ d have a car.See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.   But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like.   Fine. I ’ ll take the compact.   Alright. We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox. Would you like insurance? 
prediction:

 Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.

It happens almost everywhere.   I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.   A shouting match? You ’ re so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don ’ t believe it.
