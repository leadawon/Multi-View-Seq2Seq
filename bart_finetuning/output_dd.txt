Hi, Dan. What's new? Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days. I went to Salt Lake City on business. What's up? I got fired. How come? Last time I saw you. You told me it was a good job, and you'd like to take it as a career. That was only one month ago. Why this sudden change? It's a long story. In a word, I didn't do a good job of it. I messed up a business deal, a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up. What are you going to do now? I am trying to find a job asap. Lily doesn't know yet. I didn't tell her. I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office, and she thought I went to work as usual. 
prediction: 
That's good. You should talk to her about it.

That's not the way to solve the problem. Did you look in the classified advertisements column?

I'm sorry to hear it. What's wrong with her? Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy. She has a bad cold, and we don't want to take her with us. But we don't know who can stay with her. You need a babysitter. Yes, I'd ask Jill, the girl I've had before, but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights. I could have Suzy stay at my place. I don't want to do that to you, Karen. Why not? Your own kids would get Suzy's cold. I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here. But I don't know who to ask. I need someone more mature than Jill. It might even be for two or three days. I know who we can ask. There is a girl I know, Sara Ralston.She is 17, and she will usually take this kind of job. I know her from my church, and I trust her completely. I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice, I know. But Hank and I are leaving tonight. I'll get you her number. I hope she can do it. She is very responsible. I'm glad you know someone. I knew you would be the best person to ask about this. I don't want to insult Jill or her mother.

Good morning. Vane Theater, at your service. Hello. I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl. What's on this weekend? Well, there will be charity performance on Saturday night. And also, there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night. It's a good thing that I have choices here. Can you tell me about the one on Saturday? Sure. It's to raise money for the homeless. What about the performance itself? Oh, it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven. Wow, a story about the clever Monkey King. It's a classic and children's favorite. It surely is. And the cast is really the best. Wonderful! How much is the ticket?

Well, it's only $ 50 for a single ticket.

Hi, George. I'm going to have a job interview next week. Could you give me some advice? Sure. First of all, it ’ s very important for you not to be late. Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic. Yeah, that's very important. So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment. I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer. That ’ s right. You need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes. It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it. It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression. For example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications. 
prediction: 
That ’ s very good advice. I ’ ll try my best.
gt        : 
But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans.

I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely! No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering. Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining. Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium? Actually, the factory is located in Scotland. Really? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one! Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth... Unique, aren ’ t they? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection. Yes, very interesting flavors... Slightly spicy, very unique, that ’ s for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients? I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I ’ m sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis. Haggis? What ’ s Haggis? It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy, you take sheep ’ s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach.

Why didn't you shop around?

The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest. Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much? The same is true in the West. No, absolutely not! On the contrary, you'll be considered a well-connected, sociable man, if you keep involved in the conversation all the time. But always pay attention to what you say. If the table has a senior guest, say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible. Or maybe, you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested. You mean, keeping a low profile in the presence of the old? That goes in like with Confucius'preachings, right?

It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed... The trade deficit is getting larger, consumption's down, I really think we're headed for a recession.

I think the government should do more to encourage exports.

Increasing exports would weaken the currency. I think the main point is economic growth. We need more jobs. Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries. The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country, lower consumption, lower production, and an overall feeble economy. If more people are working, it will give the economy a boost.
