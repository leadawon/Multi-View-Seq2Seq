"Speaker 2: Do you really think so? I don't. It will just make us fat and act silly. Remember last time?""Speaker 1: I guess you are right. But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.""Speaker 2: I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.""Speaker 2: Sounds great to me! If they are willing, We could ask them to go dancing with us. That is excellent exercise and fun, Too.""Speaker 1: Good. Let's go now.""Speaker 2: You mean 30 push-ups?""Speaker 1: Yeah!""Speaker 2: The radio has too many comerials.""Speaker 2: I'm a defender. It's a lot of fun. You don't have to be able to skate as fast on defense.""Speaker 1: Yeah, You're a pretty big guy. I play goalie, Myself.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah? Which team?""Speaker 1: The Rockets.""Speaker 2: Really? I think we play you guys next week. Well, I have to go to practice. See you later.""Speaker 2: It's a prediction of your month, Based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, So I'm an Aries. When were you born?""Speaker 1: January 5th.""Speaker 2: Let's see... You're a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, But you could see new, Exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we'll both have interesting summers!""Speaker 1: That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, And my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.""Speaker 2: No, It's not, Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.""Speaker 1: Well, You certainly match those criteria, But they're so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?""Speaker 2: Who is he marring?""Speaker 1: A girl he met on holiday in Spain, I think.""Speaker 2: Have they set a date for the wedding?""Speaker 2: It's a wonderful Spanish style.""Speaker 1: Oh, I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses.""Speaker 2: And it's a bargaining. A house like this in river side costs double the price.""Speaker 1: Great, Is it a two bedroom house?""Speaker 2: No, It has three bedrooms and three beds, And has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. There's a two-car garage.""Speaker 1: That's a nice area too. It'll be a good investment for you.""Speaker 2: Yeas, When will you buy a house?""Speaker 1: Not untill the end of this year, You know, Just before my wedding.""Speaker 2: Right, Congratulations.""Speaker 2: She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she's around.""Speaker 1: For example?""Speaker 2: Well, Last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, But if you listened to her, Then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her.""Speaker 1: No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen.""Speaker 2: It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids.""Speaker 1: My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, Then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, The schools we sent them too, And everything else under the sun.""Speaker 2: You said she used to? How did you stop her?""Speaker 1: We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing, And how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things. She understood, And now everything is a lot more peaceful.""Speaker 2: It'll be close, But we'll make it.""Speaker 1: Good. After Stars. Com starts paying us, We won't need Vikam's cash anymore.""Speaker 2: I have no idea. I like cooking by myself. I like to taste delicious food.""Speaker 1: That's wonderful!""Speaker 2: And I love trying new recipes, Which I usually test with my friends. You can come, Too.""Speaker 1: Really? I hope I can have a chance to taste it. Don't forget to tell me.""Speaker 2: I know. I've even worked up a sweat.""Speaker 2: Great. I got to try so many things for the first time.""Speaker 1: Like what?""Speaker 2: I went sailing, Fishing, And horseback riding.""Speaker 1: I'm so jealous.""Speaker 2: Then, You are to walk to work.""Speaker 1: Walk?""Speaker 2: Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time.""Speaker 1: Oh no.""Speaker 2: Use the stairs, Never the elevator.""Speaker 1: Oh, Dear.""Speaker 2: And three times a week, You can either swim, Play racketball, Or hand ball.""Speaker 1: Oh no.""Speaker 2: Ok, You can stop now. It's time for the dance class.""Speaker 1: Dance class! I don't know how.""Speaker 2: You will.""Speaker 2: Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy. She is always making us kids eat the proper foods.""Speaker 1: Well, It pays off for her. How old is she anyway?""Speaker 2: She will be 86 next month.""Speaker 2: There are two classes that are still open.""Speaker 1: Which days are these classes on?""Speaker 2: The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three.""Speaker 1: What about the other class?""Speaker 2: The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12.""Speaker 1: Are you sure there are no more open classes?""Speaker 2: I'm positive.""Speaker 1: Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday.""Speaker 2: Jenny, Come and help, We need to prepare more food.""Speaker 2: A second language is always difficult.""Speaker 1: True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.""Speaker 2: A crazy language? Why do you say that?""Speaker 1: One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.""Speaker 2: My paper is on the influence of television on children.""Speaker 1: There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television.""Speaker 2: Well it was 3 to 4, But Ripen's home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base.""Speaker 1: So Baltimore is winning?""Speaker 2: Right.""Speaker 1: This is a really great place to watch a baseball game.""Speaker 2: Yeah, There isn't a bad seat in the place.""Speaker 1: The fans are great here, Too. Not like in Philadelphia.""Speaker 2: It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game.""Speaker 2: Do I have to focus it?""Speaker 1: No, This is a focus-free camera. All you have to do is point and press the button.""Speaker 2: But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history.""Speaker 2: Where did you learn it?""Speaker 1: At school, In China. This is my first time to be out of my own country.""Speaker 2: I don't like Folk music very much.""Speaker 1: What kind of music do you like?""Speaker 2: I like classical music. Do you?""Speaker 1: Not very much. Classical music sends me to sleep.""Speaker 2: I don't believe you.""Speaker 1: It's true.""Speaker 2: You are funny!""Speaker 2: I'm afraid not.""Speaker 1: Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. I like playing basketball.""Speaker 1: Can you tell me why you like it?""Speaker 2: John is in prison now. He was copped outstealing.""Speaker 2: My paper is on the influence of television on children.""Speaker 1: There are several possible sources you might use for that topic. I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television.""Speaker 2: Well, I'Ve been working so hard lately, So I'll probably just take it easy.""Speaker 1: Sounds nice.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll probably just stay in and relax. Maybe watch a few movies.""Speaker 1: Can I stop by?""Speaker 2: I believe industry is making us wealthier.""Speaker 1: I don't believe that.""Speaker 2: And in my opinion, Medicine is making us healthier.""Speaker 1: I agree with you in the sense. But we're all more miserable than ever, Aren't we?""Speaker 2: I don't agree with you. I maintain that we're healthier, Wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago.""Speaker 2: I also want to check out this video.""Speaker 1: Is that all you would like to check out?""Speaker 2: That's all I need.""Speaker 1: Do you have your library card?""Speaker 2: Here it is.""Speaker 1: Make sure to take proper care of this video.""Speaker 2: That won't be a problem.""Speaker 1: If you damage the video, You will be fined.""Speaker 2: Well, You always say you're busy.""Speaker 1: That's right.""Speaker 2: And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself.""Speaker 1: I... I... I miss my parents, Also they miss me.""Speaker 2: Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, And you didn't say anything about it.""Speaker 1: You mean I am groaned a few words?""Speaker 2: Sounds good. The food there is fantastic, Too.""Speaker 1: I agree, I had lunch there last week.""Speaker 2: I can show it to you now, If you like. I think it goes back about 8 generations so far.""Speaker 1: That's amazing. Do you have a large extended family?""Speaker 2: I'Ve got 30 cousins on my mom's side and 10 cousins on my dad's side.""Speaker 1: Are you very close to your first-cousins?""Speaker 2: The ones that are my age are close relatives. Now that I'm older, I don't spend as much time with them as I used to, So I don't know my younger cousins as well as the older ones.""Speaker 1: I see. Who's the head of your household?""Speaker 2: It's definitely my mother. And, Her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. What does your grandfather think of your step-mother?""Speaker 2: At first, She was quite critical of her, But now that they'Ve been married for a few years, She's starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother.""Speaker 2: Sure. Where shall I meet you?""Speaker 1: At the gate of the park.""Speaker 2: Great. I look forward to meeting you.""Speaker 1: See you then.""Speaker 2: Of course there is. The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration.""Speaker 1: Could you move smoothly?""Speaker 2: Yes. My face even ached in the icy wind.""Speaker 1: What happened afterwards?""Speaker 2: I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop! You can just imagine how terrified I was.""Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't quite follow you.""Speaker 1: Well, I heard David has been fired.""Speaker 2: I think we should discourage people from using their private cars. They produce too much pollution!""Speaker 1: I agree, But I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient.""Speaker 2: Cars might be convenient, But they're so bad for the environment.""Speaker 1: Do you have a car?""Speaker 2: No. I used to have one though. Once I started using my bicycle to get around, I found that I didn't really need it.""Speaker 1: Maybe if I sold my car now, I wouldn't be so tempted to use it.""Speaker 2: You could try. It would save you a lot of money.""Speaker 1: That's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, Insurance, And repairs.""Speaker 2: If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, You will get lots of exercise, Too!""Speaker 1: I could stand to lose a few pounds. Having a car has made me lazy. I never end up walking anywhere!""Speaker 2: Let's go to a car dealership. I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price.""Speaker 2: Yes. I am going to take some university courses there.""Speaker 1: Sounds hard.""Speaker 2: Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.""Speaker 1: Won't you get lonely?""Speaker 2: Please look at the sky. Don't you see the dark clouds? It's going to rain soon.""Speaker 1: Good. So we don't have to work. How nice!""Speaker 2: But I don't think it's so nice.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week.""Speaker 2: I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day.""Speaker 1: I know, Our schedules are so weird. Sometimes, The little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that's open when we get home.""Speaker 2: Yeah, And the prices there are very high.""Speaker 2: I like him. He's good for her.""Speaker 2: There is a coffee shop round the corner. Can you see that big building at the end of the road?""Speaker 1: Yes?""Speaker 2: That is a bank. The coffee shop is opposite the bank.""Speaker 1: Good. I will have hot chocolate.""Speaker 2: A stop! Wait for the lights to turn green.""Speaker 1: When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you.""Speaker 2: Sorry. How far is the museum?""Speaker 1: I am not sure. We will ask for directions in the coffee shop.""Speaker 2: Romantic? I am afraid I like thrillers better.""Speaker 1: Don't you think it's too bloody?""Speaker 2: Yeah but, It is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.""Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.""Speaker 2: I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, Find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, And that the place is hygienic.""Speaker 2: News about current affairs, Documentaries, Music, Movies, Noncommercial ads and so on.""Speaker 1: Is there anything interesting?""Speaker 2: Yes, There are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education.""Speaker 1: I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV?""Speaker 2: Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs.""Speaker 1: That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well?""Speaker 2: Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals.""Speaker 1: I got it. Do you pay for the programs?""Speaker 2: Oh, Dear. That's terrible. Not at all what I expected.""Speaker 1: It's awful, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: I can't bear to look at it. I'm rather disappointed.""Speaker 2: About ten years so far. I started learning when I was in middle school.""Speaker 1: That's really interesting.""Speaker 2: Sure. So what about you? Do you have any hobbies?""Speaker 1: Well, I like collecting matchbox! I'm not sure if that counts, Though.""Speaker 2: How can you live without job in the future?""Speaker 2: In my country football is brand new, So I never learned the game when I was younger.""Speaker 1: It's a very popular game in America.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I heard a lot about it. Is it really that fun?""Speaker 1: For me, It's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play.""Speaker 2: Are you a football player?""Speaker 1: No, I just for fun with my friends. We play two hand touch or flag football. We're too old to play tackle football.""Speaker 2: What is two hand touch and flag football?""Speaker 1: Instead of tackling somebody, You just have to touch them with two hands, Or if it is flag football, Grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing.""Speaker 2: I see. It's safer then right?""Speaker 1: Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, You're welcome to join us.""Speaker 2: I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together.""Speaker 1: Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning.""Speaker 2: I will find one myself, Of course. I'm a modern girl.""Speaker 1: Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, The latest type.""Speaker 2: You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea.""Speaker 1: No, There is an updated virgin, Three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, You can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes.""Speaker 2: I don't think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time.""Speaker 1: I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, So-called love at first sight.""Speaker 2: Anyway, I don't want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. There are many other options using the internet as dating methods. Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications. Of course, For these sites, You have to pay a membership fee. But all in all, It is more serious and professional. The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher.""Speaker 2: Really? Well, What time does it start?""Speaker 1: It starts at 8.""Speaker 2: Well, Who all is going to be there?""Speaker 1: Everyone from school.""Speaker 2: How do you know it's going to be so fun?""Speaker 1: This party is going to have a DJ, Food, And drinks.""Speaker 2: Wow, That does sound like it's going to be fun.""Speaker 1: So am I going to see you at the party?""Speaker 2: Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?""Speaker 1: I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.""Speaker 2: I can see that you are trying, But where do you think you could improve?""Speaker 1: I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis.""Speaker 2: Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, Right?""Speaker 1: I'll try ; it's hard!""Speaker 2: What is it? Why did you buy a brick?""Speaker 1: There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick.""Speaker 2: And?""Speaker 1: So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.""Speaker 2: And it's a brick?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?""Speaker 1: I wanted to. But he said, No, The box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, Other people won't believe it's new.""Speaker 2: So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.""Speaker 1: Yes, It was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products. Look, It even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.""Speaker 2: But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?""Speaker 1: He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.""Speaker 2: Aha! Now I understand. You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk. So, What I think is, You deserve to get cheated!""Speaker 1: C'mon, Don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it. We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.""Speaker 2: That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.""Speaker 2: Well, I didn't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! And we have so much in common. We like the same team, Music, And most amazingly, We both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.""Speaker 1: It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?""Speaker 2: There's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, But when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends.""Speaker 1: Well, That's something I've never heard of. But if you ask me what I value most in a friend, I would say honesty.""Speaker 2: I agree. You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person. Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Yeah, But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.""Speaker 1: A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.""Speaker 2: It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.""Speaker 1: Turtles? Whatever... Look, All that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, That's what the math says.""Speaker 2: Math, Sheath. What's the evidence?""Speaker 1: There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, Thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, The Big Bang... DuH!""Speaker 2: Anyway, It's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. I think it's about your attitude towards learning. One should be open to new ideas, Decisions, Skills or behaviors.""Speaker 1: Then the axiom - 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks' doesn't work any longer.""Speaker 2: You're right. Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts.""Speaker 1: Yes, I agree with you. When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active.""Speaker 2: Me too. To keep up with the changing world, One must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things.""Speaker 1: You know what? I've recently been teaching myself French.""Speaker 2: Really? That's great! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France.""Speaker 2: Are you going to have a birthday party?""Speaker 2: No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!""Speaker 1: Look, There are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, Or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before.""Speaker 2: I know, I know. I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?""Speaker 2: Because you seem to have lost your vigilance. You should be on the watch out.""Speaker 1: I have no reason to distrust him. He's never caused any harm.""Speaker 2: Isn't there anything that sounds fishy?""Speaker 1: Nothing smells a rat. I told you that he's an all-right guy.""Speaker 2: You are right. Our company's Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking.""Speaker 1: I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.""Speaker 2: No, It will not be formal at all. It is a fun time. You will love the game show. Please dress casually. Usually there is an over abandon of drinks, So be careful with that.""Speaker 2: I'm not sure, He is a manager I think.""Speaker 1: Really? Are you going to introduce us?""Speaker 2: Was I? Sorry, I didn't mean to be. I do apologize.""Speaker 1: And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?""Speaker 2: Well, On Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis. Then on Sunday I hiked in the country.""Speaker 1: And I bet you studied, Too.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I studied on Sunday evening. What about you?""Speaker 1: Well, I didn't clean the house and I didn't study. I stayed in bed and watched TV.""Speaker 2: That sounds like fun, But did you exercise?""Speaker 2: I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, Because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly.""Speaker 1: Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.""Speaker 2: Did she? That's great. However, If we have too many children, That will have a bad effect on the enviroment.""Speaker 1: How's your son these days?""Speaker 2: Oh, He's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays.""Speaker 1: He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child?""Speaker 2: I had mine when I was 24. That's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., Or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.""Speaker 1: Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, But not just yet.""Speaker 2: Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country?""Speaker 1: Yes, There is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, Have fun, And explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, But they don't often succeed.""Speaker 2: Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.""Speaker 2: Really? How was it?""Speaker 1: Fantastic! I didn't want to come back.""Speaker 2: I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful.""Speaker 1: They are. And not only that the people are friendly, But also the food is delicious, Not to mention cheap.""Speaker 2: I do like Thai food. Did you see much of Bangkok?""Speaker 1: Not much. I've got enough city life in Beijing.""Speaker 2: I know what you mean. I could use a vacation myself.""Speaker 1: Hey, Wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime?""Speaker 2: Which room are you in?""Speaker 1: 1808. The toilet doesn't work properly, The water doesn't run in the shower.""Speaker 2: Not only that!""Speaker 1: Tell me! Tell me! What's your secret?!""Speaker 2: Ok, Ok. I'll whisper it to you, But you have to promise not to tell anyone!""Speaker 2: I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. And you have strong working ability and professional skill, It seems that you know all, That's really wonderful!""Speaker 1: You know the phrase, The survival the fittest. We have no choices.""Speaker 2: Do you work in Shanghai?""Speaker 1: Yes I do. How about you?""Speaker 2: No, I'm a tourist. This place is amazing! It's much bigger than I imagined, And much more exciting! There's so much to see here.""Speaker 1: You can say that again! It's much more modern than people imagine. Where are you from?""Speaker 2: Um, Well let's see... I'm from Kansas originally. A much quieter and more peaceful place than here, That's for sure!""Speaker 2: I don't think so. In Korea some marriages break up, But most couples stay together.""Speaker 1: Do people get married young?""Speaker 2: Not really. Very few people get married beforethe age of 20.""Speaker 1: Hmm. Do women usually work after they get married?""Speaker 2: Yeah, That's it.""Speaker 2: I'm planning to return to China after graduation.""Speaker 1: Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.""Speaker 2: Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment.""Speaker 2: I'm no better than them. They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time, But I think it's stimulating.""Speaker 1: You won't play online games full of violence, Will you?""Speaker 2: Once in a while.""Speaker 1: It's no good. And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time. You might as well do something healthy and meaningful.""Speaker 2: I have had disagreement with every director. I'Ve worked with. We'Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't no.""Speaker 1: Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you?""Speaker 2: Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think.""Speaker 1: Did you do you own stunts in the movie?""Speaker 2: I wanted to, But my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, But I'll leave that to the experts in future.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much for doing this interview.""Speaker 2: My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet?""Speaker 2: Come on! A little labor, Much health.""Speaker 1: Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter.""Speaker 2: Don't take too long. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather.""Speaker 1: I won't be long. No more than ten minutes. Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park?""Speaker 2: Don't apologize! From the moment I met you, Not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again, I'm... I'm just scared, Veronica. The closer I get to you, The worse it gets. The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it! We were made for each other, Veronica. You are my everything, My soul mate. What can I do?""Speaker 1: Just hold me... I'll always be here for you, No matter what. And together, We can tackle whatever life throws at us. I believe in us, Steven.""Speaker 2: Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend?""Speaker 1: He said not to bother coming back. And I said, Fine, I won't.""Speaker 2: He is tall and slim, Fair-haired.""Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?""Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?""Speaker 2: He didn't say, But he said he would call me.""Speaker 1: Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!""Speaker 2: Oh, Steve. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call?""Speaker 1: Come on, Mary, You're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry.""Speaker 2: Thank you, Steve. You're always so encouraging.""Speaker 2: Actually, The business trip itself was very successful. We arrived on time, We had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year.""Speaker 1: Sounds quite fruitful, Why do you call it still a nightmare then?""Speaker 2: Well, The air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge. I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam. When I finally got home, I was totally exhausted. But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout.""Speaker 1: This is really a sad story. Did they trace back your luggage?""Speaker 2: I am still waiting for their call.""Speaker 2: You are right. Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise. Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit.""Speaker 2: I don't like the way they sag down. I feel like I have plumber butt in them.""Speaker 1: That's the style! You just wear boxers.""Speaker 2: What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug? What then?""Speaker 1: You're so old fashioned! Nobody is going to pull down your pants!""Speaker 2: Yes, My wife is coming to get me.""Speaker 1: That's good. Do you live near here?""Speaker 2: No, We live in the suburbs. What about you?""Speaker 1: I live downtown, With my parents.""Speaker 2: Do you have a car?""Speaker 1: I don't need a car. I walk to work.""Speaker 2: Well, It's a special day. They say if you survive the first year, The rest is smooth sailing.""Speaker 1: That's good to know. Oh, Listen! The band's playing our song.""Speaker 2: I requested it. What do you say? Do you have your dancing shoes on?""Speaker 2: Thanks. Lovely day. Pity I'm on duty.""Speaker 1: I'll stand in with you if you like. I'Ve got nothing else to do.""Speaker 2: Is there something any need?""Speaker 1: Are your free this weekend?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have nothing to do.""Speaker 1: Great, Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend?""Speaker 2: I beg your pardon?""Speaker 1: I'd like to call on you this weekend. I just want to a drop in for a chat.""Speaker 2: Really? Well, Ok, You're welcome.""Speaker 1: Is 5 PM. Saturday a good time for you?""Speaker 2: Hmm, How about seven? I can treat you to dinner.""Speaker 1: Sure, That would be great. I'll bring the wine.""Speaker 2: Ok. Then I'll be expecting you.""Speaker 2: You hit the white ball with your cue. The white ball hits the colored balls. And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets.""Speaker 1: How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one?""Speaker 2: At the beginning, It does not matter, But once someone gets one ball in, It is set.""Speaker 1: Can I get the black ball in?""Speaker 2: The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets.""Speaker 2: No, I forgot to buy some.""Speaker 1: Then we'll have to put up with it.""Speaker 2: We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, They'll get drunk and fall asleep.""Speaker 1: That's without a doubt, The best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it!""Speaker 2: Don't be so irritable. I just don't understand the program, That's all.""Speaker 1: All right, I will explain it to you later on. Now scram.""Speaker 2: Ok. I will wait until you have had your fun, If that's what you want.""Speaker 2: No, Seriously... I really want this.""Speaker 1: I tell ya, When I got the invite, It really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.""Speaker 2: I know. But things have changed. I guess I've settled down.""Speaker 2: It is different now. The world is becoming colorful. Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry. We all want to wait for the right moment.""Speaker 1: What time is the right moment?""Speaker 2: We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice.""Speaker 1: That's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark.""Speaker 2: It can't be that bad.""Speaker 1: I wish it wasn't, But there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here.""Speaker 2: Really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, Because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime.""Speaker 1: Do me a favor, And take a taxi. It'd make me feel a lot better.""Speaker 2: Ok, We will. How do you get around in the evenings?""Speaker 1: When I first moved in, I walked everywhere. But within a week, I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station! Now, I always take public transportation.""Speaker 2: Has anything else happened to you?""Speaker 1: Nothing else has happened to me, But I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close.""Speaker 2: John is in prison now. He was copped outstealing.""Speaker 2: Yes, I do.""Speaker 1: There is a wait right now to use the computers.""Speaker 2: That's fine.""Speaker 1: Would you please write your name on this list?""Speaker 2: Then what?""Speaker 1: I will call you when a computer is free.""Speaker 2: How do I log on to the computer?""Speaker 1: Use the number on the back of your library card.""Speaker 2: Then does it go well with my sweater?""Speaker 1: Yes. You look very smart today.""Speaker 2: I mean it's not his fault.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah?""Speaker 2: Do you come from a country where they shake hands?""Speaker 1: Oh yes. Men, Women, And children shake hands all the time.""Speaker 2: It's very simple. Men shake hands, Women and children don't.""Speaker 1: But some women do shake hands. And now a lot of children have such good manners, They shake hands too.""Speaker 2: Well, A good rule to follow is, For men you hold out your hand, For women and children, You wait and see what they do.""Speaker 1: That sounds easy enough.""Speaker 2: Yes, Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yes, I know the one. How was the food?""Speaker 2: The food was excellent, But Jane ordered a birthday cake, Which they forgot about. So as you can see, You were not the only one.""Speaker 1: Oh, No.""Speaker 2: Yes, Jane was quite upset about it. The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert, But still...""Speaker 1: I would think this was the least they could do.""Speaker 2: In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while.""Speaker 1: Great. I have also been thinking of getting one. Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret? My birthday is not that far away.""Speaker 2: When did you start worrying about your weight?""Speaker 1: I'm not. I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today. Why? Do you think I'm fat?""Speaker 2: Oh no, Ari. I didn't mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight. Let's go Dutch. I'll pay my own way. I insist.""Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to this film. I read a good review of it in this morning's newspaper.""Speaker 2: Me, Too. It will be great to see something light and funny for a change. I'm tired of heavy drama.""Speaker 1: Are these seats okay?""Speaker 2: Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for. Besides, I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes.""Speaker 1: Do you have an online edition of that magazine?""Speaker 2: Yes, They do. But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription.""Speaker 1: Do you have a subscription?""Speaker 2: Yes, I do. The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month. Do you every buy magazines?""Speaker 2: I'm sorry. What's your name again?""Speaker 1: Barbara. But please, Just call me Barb.""Speaker 2: So Barb... What do you do?""Speaker 1: I'm studying medicine.""Speaker 2: Really? Where?""Speaker 1: At Harvard. What about you?""Speaker 2: I'm an engineer at IBM.""Speaker 1: Oh, Are you? That sounds interesting.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I like it. Hey, It looks like the food is ready.""Speaker 2: What's the big deal? It's just a picture of some woman.""Speaker 1: I've seen it so many times in books, But I never imagined I'd get to see it in person.""Speaker 2: There are tons of other paintings that I think are better.""Speaker 1: Maybe so, But do you have any idea how much this one is worth?""Speaker 2: No, How much is it worth?""Speaker 1: About 80 million dollars.""Speaker 2: Sure, I have a part-time job as a bartender.""Speaker 1: Cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar!""Speaker 2: Yeah, But I'm not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, The manager would be pretty upset.""Speaker 1: That's true. I'm wondering did you learn anything from the job?""Speaker 2: Of course. There's always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world.""Speaker 1: You mean you got working experience, Right?""Speaker 2: Not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.""Speaker 1: It must be very demanding.""Speaker 2: Sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, It's easy to figure out.""Speaker 1: Really? It sounds interesting.""Speaker 2: Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I'll show you around.""Speaker 2: It must be old.""Speaker 1: At least more than 100 years old.""Speaker 2: Let's enter it!""Speaker 1: I can't open the door.""Speaker 2: It must be locked.""Speaker 1: Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.""Speaker 2: She can't answer you.""Speaker 1: She must be deaf.""Speaker 2: It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?""Speaker 2: Sure. I think it's a fantastic place to go.""Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more. That's an ideal place for a vacation.""Speaker 2: It sure is.""Speaker 2: That sounds like fun. But where can I get clothes that old?""Speaker 1: Check out your mom's closet. I'll bet she still has something.""Speaker 2: Good idea. Can I bring some music from that period too?""Speaker 1: That will be great! Do you have LPs or Cds?""Speaker 2: A, Whatever you do, The most important is perseverance. So you have to hang on there, The longer, The better. Then some day, You will find you've already made a lot of progress.""Speaker 1: Yeah, You are right. I must stop complaining and stick to it every day.""Speaker 2: Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, He's got Richard's eyes though.""Speaker 1: Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.""Speaker 2: Well, Children usually resemble their parents.""Speaker 1: It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.""Speaker 2: You often like comparing children with their parents.""Speaker 2: May I ask you for a dance?""Speaker 1: Certainly.""Speaker 2: You are doing the waltz wonderfully well.""Speaker 2: Not always. Sometimes we don't understand her. Then she has to repeat what she said.""Speaker 1: It must be interesting to study English.""Speaker 2: Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good.""Speaker 1: Is English pronunciation easy or difficult?""Speaker 2: No, It can't be. Really? Who?""Speaker 1: I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, But staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.""Speaker 2: What did you do?""Speaker 1: I didn't do anything. Finally, He left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.""Speaker 2: Did he leave when you left?""Speaker 1: Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.""Speaker 2: What did you do?""Speaker 1: He followed me all the way home!""Speaker 2: That's about five blocks. And around corners too. So he was definitely following you.""Speaker 1: Yes, He was. I'm not imagining it. Finally, Just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him. He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious. What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police?""Speaker 2: Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least. He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it. But if anything happens again, Then maybe you should call.""Speaker 1: Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!""Speaker 2: Of course you can call the police if you want. That's not what I mean. I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything.""Speaker 1: I suppose. What can they do? I don't even know who he is.""Speaker 2: Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much. Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out. If you see him a third time, And if he follows you again, Then I think we should go to the police. But for now, Just try not to worry.""Speaker 2: Oh, My God! John, I didn't know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, Like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.""Speaker 1: Come on, HanMaimed, Don't make a fuss. A lot of Americans, Including many scientists, Believe in religion.""Speaker 2: But I'm really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, Are they?""Speaker 1: Yes, They are compatible. Actually, The U.S. Is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world.""Speaker 2: I've heard about it a little bit before, But I don't understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist?""Speaker 1: That's a little complicated. You'll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U.S. History later on. Religion was and is a part of American people's life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, Which is a highly academic institution, Is in a sense the product of religion.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England.""Speaker 2: Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators?""Speaker 1: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans.""Speaker 2: How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?""Speaker 1: That's because in the 16th and 17th century, There was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.""Speaker 2: So, You mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England?""Speaker 1: Yes, That's why Puritans moved to the New World, Where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, It was these Puritans who founded Harvard College.""Speaker 2: Why did they want to found a college?""Speaker 1: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see.""Speaker 1: Actually Harvard was first named 'New College', Without a formal name.""Speaker 2: When did it begin to be called Harvard University?""Speaker 1: In 1639, It was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman.""Speaker 2: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.""Speaker 1: Therefore, It's not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, There would note Harvard.""Speaker 2: Wow, I didn't know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history.""Speaker 1: Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U.S.""Speaker 2: I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard.""Speaker 1: Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U.S. History and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.""Speaker 2: That's right. I have a lot to learn from you.""Speaker 2: But I have an appointment with Ann.""Speaker 2: What do you do in winter?""Speaker 1: Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.""Speaker 2: I think most people do. I like wearing nice, Colorful clothes in summer-you know, A nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter.""Speaker 1: Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze!""Speaker 2: Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year?""Speaker 2: University? Why? You asked me last year.""Speaker 1: Oh, I forget. Sorry.""Speaker 2: I went to Harvard University.""Speaker 1: Did you? And what course did you take there?""Speaker 2: God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?""Speaker 1: I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.""Speaker 2: I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?""Speaker 2: Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions?""Speaker 1: Just about. There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone.""Speaker 2: How Ay days will the reunion be?""Speaker 1: Usually it's at least five days and four nights.""Speaker 2: A second language is always difficult.""Speaker 1: True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.""Speaker 2: A crazy language? Why do you say that?""Speaker 1: One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.""Speaker 2: Yes. I thought it was excellent. Didn't you?""Speaker 1: Not really. I thought it was disappointing.""Speaker 2: It's a nice cinema, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: Yeah, Yeah, But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.""Speaker 1: A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.""Speaker 2: It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.""Speaker 1: Turtles? Whatever... Look, All that's required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, That's what the math says.""Speaker 2: Math, Sheath. What's the evidence?""Speaker 1: There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, Thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, The Big Bang... DuH!""Speaker 2: Anyway, It's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where's the scientific rigor in that?""Speaker 2: Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?""Speaker 1: No, I'm not hungry.""Speaker 2: You knew Brain Locker?""Speaker 1: Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like?""Speaker 2: Well, He's thin and tall. He has brown hair, A holt nose, Green eyes and wearing glasses.""Speaker 2: That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, Except me. There are a few South Koreans, Several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, And o.""Speaker 1: Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.""Speaker 2: I guess so, But I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, Especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.""Speaker 1: Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.""Speaker 2: I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.""Speaker 2: I'Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave. How do you feel today?""Speaker 1: I feel much better now.""Speaker 2: Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday?""Speaker 1: I'Ve already got it. Thanks.""Speaker 2: I will explain it in detail in the next class. Could you preview it?""Speaker 2: Forsythia. It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival.""Speaker 1: Spring is a lively season.""Speaker 2: Yes. How about you?""Speaker 1: I admire plum blossoms very much. It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter.""Speaker 2: You have a perfect taste!""Speaker 1: It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow. I admire the bravery of plum blossoms.""Speaker 2: But it used to be ignored by many people.""Speaker 1: The bright people will remember it forever.""Speaker 2: I missed today's weather for cast in the radio.""Speaker 1: It seems 10 degree below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather, But do hate when it get slippery.""Speaker 2: The ice is soon be thick for skating. I'm so fine to want a sport.""Speaker 2: I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.""Speaker 1: Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.""Speaker 2: Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.""Speaker 1: Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.""Speaker 2: I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power.""Speaker 1: You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, But dance might make you livelier and happier.""Speaker 2: No, So it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop.""Speaker 1: What kind of things would you like to see on the menu?""Speaker 2: Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least.""Speaker 1: That shouldn't be too difficult. Since this is a small neighborhood, Maybe they will take this suggestion.""Speaker 2: Oh, What a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own.""Speaker 1: In fact, They're both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, Since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.""Speaker 2: Oh, Right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It's hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?""Speaker 1: It's still a mystery. Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant. But she begins to take her maternity leave now.""Speaker 2: Wow, That much? Don't they have any public courses?""Speaker 1: Very few, Unfortunately.""Speaker 2: How was your game today?""Speaker 1: Extremely good. I shot a 78, Including 5 birdies!""Speaker 2: Congratulations! What's your normal handicap?""Speaker 1: Ten. How did your game go?""Speaker 2: My drives were terrible today. I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps.""Speaker 2: That sounds great. So, Do you want to have dinner at 6:00?""Speaker 1: Uh, I'd like to, But I have to work late.""Speaker 2: Oh, That's OK. Let's just meet at the theater before the show, Around 7:30.""Speaker 2: Not much. My girlfriend just dumped me.""Speaker 1: Sorry to hear that. What happened?""Speaker 2: Well, She told me things just weren't working out and we weren't right together. But I thought things were just great. Why did she say this? It's completely out of the blue.""Speaker 1: Hey, That's not the girl with pink hair, Is it? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday.""Speaker 2: What? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy. Oh, No, I feel like such a loser.""Speaker 1: Hey, She is not worth it. Forget her.""Speaker 2: But she lied to me.""Speaker 1: Hey, She is not worth it. Anyway, There are plenty more fish in the sea. Listen, Let's go for a drink in the town. How about that?""Speaker 2: Ok, Then.""Speaker 1: But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face.""Speaker 2: What face?""Speaker 1: The one where you look like your dog just died. You have to get over her and the sooner the better.""Speaker 2: Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly. It can stop quickly.""Speaker 1: Hey, Just watch out for cops or you're gonna end up in the slammer. You know you tend to go fast?""Speaker 2: Yes, I know it. I went through my last set of tires fast. I even had three flat tires in two weeks.""Speaker 1: Now watch... Some guys probably run a light and hit your car.""Speaker 2: Mormons believe that, After the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10, Their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men. In 1830, A prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church.""Speaker 1: Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt?""Speaker 2: That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, But not all.""Speaker 1: Do you believe that Mormons have all of it?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: Why do you really go to church?""Speaker 2: You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer. I'm scared stiff about going into the city center at night.""Speaker 1: There must have been some good news in the newspaper. I can't believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited.""Speaker 2: Well, There was one good piece of news. You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease?""Speaker 1: Yes. Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states.""Speaker 2: Well, They'Ve got the money and she's going tomorrow for treatment.""Speaker 1: I'm so happy for the family! They must be very relieved and excited about that.""Speaker 2: I'm sure they are. Oh, And a local man won the lottery. I'm so jealous! I wish it were me! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I'm amazed that I haven't even won a small prize yet. It's so unfair!""Speaker 2: I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.""Speaker 1: What about the expression goodbye? Is that an idiom?""Speaker 2: That is just a natural, Grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.""Speaker 2: There's a parking structure for students.""Speaker 1: Where can I find it?""Speaker 2: Go to the western side of the campus, And you'll find it there.""Speaker 1: Is it full?""Speaker 2: When I went up there, It wasn't full at all.""Speaker 1: When was that?""Speaker 2: Sometime this morning.""Speaker 1: Would it be full now?""Speaker 2: This is terrible. Why do hackers play such a dirty trick?""Speaker 1: Hackers are smart, And they want people to know about it.""Speaker 2: Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident.""Speaker 1: That's too bad. How are things now?""Speaker 2: I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month.""Speaker 1: What kind of volunteer work?""Speaker 2: I help out at the children's hospital. I help plan activities.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah?""Speaker 2: She's a librarian at the public library.""Speaker 1: Really? And Chris? She was a very pretty little girl.""Speaker 2: Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris. She's married to a French photographer.""Speaker 1: Oh, How interesting. And what about Larry and Rocky?""Speaker 2: Larry drives a truck. He drives all over the country. We hardly ever seen him.""Speaker 1: Really? Where does he live now?""Speaker 2: Colorado.""Speaker 1: And does Rocky drive a truck, Too?""Speaker 2: Oh, No. Rocky is a pilot.""Speaker 1: Really? Where does he fly? Does he fly to other countries?""Speaker 2: Not at all. I think the tattoos are so cool and chic.""Speaker 1: You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people.""Speaker 2: Honey, It's not so serious. It's just an animal.""Speaker 1: Just an animal? But it has life too. If you want a tattoo, Get one. It's your choice because you want it. But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one?""Speaker 2: She's my little niece. It's her birthday. They're singing \"Happy Birthday\".""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. How old is she?""Speaker 2: She's ten.""Speaker 1: I suppose they're playing games.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Ellie was playing games all day yesterday. By the way, Alice, When's your birthday?""Speaker 1: Today.""Speaker 2: Today?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: Well, Imagine that! How old are you?""Speaker 1: Eighteen. Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight. Do you want to come?""Speaker 2: Very much. What time?""Speaker 1: About 6:00.""Speaker 2: I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea.""Speaker 1: And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress.""Speaker 2: Not only our annual sales brake a record, But our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well. After a two-year slump, We finally back in the black.""Speaker 1: The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president. He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation. Products are selling like hotcakes.""Speaker 2: I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution, And partly because of our new marketing strategy. Because of the new advertising campaign, We have become the top sellers in the field.""Speaker 1: Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts. I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good.""Speaker 2: Fortunately, Yes. You're blushing!""Speaker 1: Am I? Um... My face gets red when I walk too fast.""Speaker 2: Me too. Do you think they are going to get the championship this time?""Speaker 2: Sounds good. What do we need to bring?""Speaker 1: We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers, And I'm making potato salad.""Speaker 2: America? Did you get admit to MIT?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: Congratulations! Susan. I'm so happy for you.""Speaker 1: Thank you.""Speaker 2: Really going to miss you.""Speaker 1: Me too. I'll write to you once I get settled. But I have so much to do. You might have to wait a while. But I really will write to you. I love to write letters. I think it's more meaning than the emails even than the phone call.""Speaker 2: Ok. Take care. Have a nice journey.""Speaker 1: Thank you.""Speaker 2: Look after yourself. Bye.""Speaker 2: Yeah, What was all that stuff about running tests about anyway?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure, But we can find out. I bought some crosswords to keep him busy.""Speaker 2: Oh yes, I loved it. Wasn't the scene with the judge great?""Speaker 2: I thought she'd be happy.""Speaker 1: Yeah, Especially since she got a promotion recently.""Speaker 2: Great, Here are some flowers for you. I hope you like them. I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment.""Speaker 1: Thank you, They're beautiful. You can hang your coat over there. Try this new couch, It is so comfortable. You will love it. Want something to drink, Tea, Coffee, Juice or Cola?""Speaker 2: Don't bother. I will help myself.""Speaker 1: Make yourself at home.""Speaker 2: It is such a nice place.""Speaker 2: I lost the table tennis game yesterday.""Speaker 1: Oh, What a pity!""Speaker 2: I just don't want to play table tennis any more.""Speaker 1: Is it that bad? It's nothing more than a game.""Speaker 2: My opponent bowled me with the very first ball. I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis.""Speaker 1: Oh, Come on! Failure is the mother of success. Don't lose heart. I'm sure you'll succeed.""Speaker 2: Perhaps you are right. But I still need some time to recover from the failure.""Speaker 2: Of course. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer...""Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.""Speaker 2: You're dancing so well.""Speaker 1: You dance beautifully too.""Speaker 2: When did you learn to dance?""Speaker 1: In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?""Speaker 2: It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz.""Speaker 1: How about tango?""Speaker 2: Oh, I like it. It's such a beautiful dance, But I can't do it well. What about you?""Speaker 1: Tango is my favorite. Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot. ( the music has stopped ).""Speaker 2: Thank you for the dance.""Speaker 1: My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.""Speaker 2: The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.""Speaker 2: That's too bad.""Speaker 1: Then my son drove into a tree.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.""Speaker 1: The dog bit the delivery boy.""Speaker 2: What a pity!""Speaker 1: And a storm blew our roof away.""Speaker 2: Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, He's got Richard's eyes though.""Speaker 1: Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.""Speaker 2: Well, Children usually resemble their parents.""Speaker 1: It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.""Speaker 2: You often like comparing children with their parents.""Speaker 2: That's right. Why do you ask?""Speaker 1: Well, I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon.""Speaker 2: When are getting married?""Speaker 1: Some time next year. We haven't set the date yet.""Speaker 2: Congratulations! I had no idea.""Speaker 1: Thank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time?""Speaker 2: Do you like amusement parks?""Speaker 1: For the most part, Yes. Some of the rides are bit too scary for me, Though.""Speaker 2: If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can, You'll have a good time.""Speaker 1: Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark?""Speaker 2: Even those. It'll be very romantic, I think. You'll have loads of fun.""Speaker 1: Thanks for the advice. I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight.""Speaker 2: More or less. How well do you understand Mr. Wang, Your Chinese teacher?""Speaker 2: I not only passed my test, But I aced it! I'm so happy!""Speaker 1: You should be. You worked really hard last night preparing for it.""Speaker 2: Thanks for helping me with it. If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best, I wouldn't have ever been able to pass.""Speaker 1: You don't have to thank me. It's just a part of my job as your counsellor.""Speaker 2: Did you always do well at school?""Speaker 1: No, In fact, I was terrible at taking exams.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: Sure, But my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot. When are your final exams?""Speaker 2: I'll get my finals in two months.""Speaker 1: When do you plan on studying for those exams?""Speaker 2: Most students just cram the night forehead.""Speaker 1: Do you think that's a good idea?""Speaker 2: No, I think I should study a little bit at a time, Starting a few weeks before the exam.""Speaker 1: That sounds like a good idea. What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying?""Speaker 2: I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant.""Speaker 2: I'll tell you what. Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones.""Speaker 1: That sounds fair. That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us.""Speaker 2: Not as fun though. A live band is way more exciting!""Speaker 1: Our class doesn't have enough money. We already checked into it.""Speaker 2: I like Santa Monica.""Speaker 1: The water there looks so dirty.""Speaker 2: I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica.""Speaker 1: I like the pier too, Because it's beautiful at night.""Speaker 2: Is Malibu beach nice?""Speaker 1: It's a lot nicer, And I really like it better.""Speaker 2: So you want to go to Malibu?""Speaker 1: If that's okay with you.""Speaker 2: Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term, Rather than the long term. It's the same with the destruction of the rainforests. Countries and companies just want the wood. They're not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests. We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life.""Speaker 1: In other parts of the world, Especially in Africa, There is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow enough food.""Speaker 2: It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains. Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people.""Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment.""Speaker 2: Well, I used to hate cooking, But now I love it.""Speaker 1: When did you change your mind?""Speaker 2: After I tried French food. Before that, I used to cook really boring things for my family.""Speaker 1: I still can't believe it! So, Did you go to cooking school or something?""Speaker 2: Yeah. I went to California to study.""Speaker 1: Really? How long did you stay there?""Speaker 2: I was there between 88 and 90.""Speaker 1: And what did you do after that?""Speaker 2: Congratulations! That's wonderful. I bet both of you are quite happy.""Speaker 1: Well, We have always dreamed of owning our own home, But real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive.""Speaker 2: I understand. That's why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town, Far from the city.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea if you can find employment nearby.""Speaker 2: It doesn't seem like this library has it.""Speaker 1: Have you checked the computer?""Speaker 2: I have already.""Speaker 1: What did it say?""Speaker 2: It says the book is on the shelf, But I didn't find it there.""Speaker 1: I can always borrow the book from another library.""Speaker 2: You can do that?""Speaker 1: I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in.""Speaker 2: What is the rate?""Speaker 1: Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen, Pinto andDatsun, And twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth.""Speaker 2: How about mileage and gas?""Speaker 1: There is no charge for mileage. And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included.""Speaker 2: Ok. I'll try a Pinto. I want to rent a car for one week.""Speaker 1: All right, Sir. May I have your driver's license?""Speaker 2: Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?""Speaker 1: No, I'm not hungry.""Speaker 2: It depends. But usually it's about 15 days.""Speaker 1: Do you eat any special food for the festival?""Speaker 2: Yes,Dumpling is a must. There is also other food. For example, People eat chicken for good luck.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: Yes, It's really wonderful!""Speaker 1: Oh, Great! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing.""Speaker 2: Just a little. Has your toothache gone now?""Speaker 1: Yes, For the most part. It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments, Anyway.""Speaker 2: How about your tongue? Does it still hurt?""Speaker 1: No, The burn ointment seemed to take effect right away. I think it's already healed.""Speaker 2: How did you get that burn again?""Speaker 1: I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago.""Speaker 2: You haven't had much luck lately, Have you?""Speaker 1: No, But I'm sure I'll get better soon.""Speaker 2: When's the last time you took your tablets?""Speaker 1: I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch.""Speaker 2: I think it's time you took another does of each. What would you like to drink with them?""Speaker 1: Just some water, Please. Do you have any ointment for my nose? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much.""Speaker 2: Sure, I'll just go and get it now. What would you like to eat? Some soup?""Speaker 1: That sounds good.""Speaker 2: Did you ask his former secretary, Lora? She knows a lot about him.""Speaker 2: Who, Femi? Yeah, Yi-jun saw her inside.""Speaker 1: All these memories of prom night came back to me. I had to be alone. You remember that night?""Speaker 2: With everything, With everybody, With all this!""Speaker 1: A good suggestion for you. You need a holiday.""Speaker 2: It wasn't always like this, You know.""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: Well, I mean. We always do the same thing. There's no variety in our lives.""Speaker 1: You need a holiday. That's what's the matter.""Speaker 2: Oh, That's so nice of you! Thank you very much.""Speaker 1: My pleasure Miss. Actually, Could you recommend what to eat here? I've never been here before.""Speaker 2: Sure. Well, The avocado sandwich is delicious, And it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also, The milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town!""Speaker 1: Well, Thanks for the suggestions.""Speaker 2: Yes, I know that.""Speaker 1: So, Can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present?""Speaker 2: I'm rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off.""Speaker 2: Can you give me a touch of his character?""Speaker 2: They're going to give us back the seats?""Speaker 1: No, They're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in...""Speaker 2: Hawaii? My dream honeymoon destination?""Speaker 1: You got it! We'll fly there directly from Texas.""Speaker 2: That is called a nuclear family.""Speaker 1: I don't like such a family.""Speaker 2: What kind of family are you like?""Speaker 1: I like a family composed of many people. It includes grandparents, Parents, Aunts and uncles, And children.""Speaker 2: It's a traditional family. It may be too large to live well.""Speaker 2: Yeah. They suit each other. A perfect match between a man and a girl.""Speaker 2: Well, Thank you, Mr. Smith. But I was just doing my job.""Speaker 1: Yes. And we're proud of you, Loans.""Speaker 2: No, But I'm planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon. I'Ve heard that they are beautiful countries. Which is the most beautiful country you'Ve been to?""Speaker 1: I think I ‘d say norway. It has many picturesque fjords, Waterfalls, And mountains.""Speaker 2: Isn't it really cold there?""Speaker 1: Well, The north of Norway is almost always cold, But further south it can be fairly warm in summer. It's a wet country, So there's snow almost everywhere in winter.""Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I am on the diet.""Speaker 1: That sounds ridiculous. Why?""Speaker 2: Yes, Please do.""Speaker 1: Wow, A remote car model and my favorite brand. I really like it. That is so nice of you.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car. It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself.""Speaker 2: I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market.""Speaker 2: I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves. They only want it for their films.""Speaker 1: No way! They want publicity for themselves, So that they get invited to make more films, Go to lots of cocktail parties, And even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party.""Speaker 2: Show biz stars have plenty of expenses. That's why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, Seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and at-shirt, But they can't because their managers force them to wear clothes they don't like.""Speaker 1: I don't understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They're overpaid, Over-ambitious, And over-adored.""Speaker 2: I think you should give them some credit. They're very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves.""Speaker 2: Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup!""Speaker 1: I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, How can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?""Speaker 2: You'Ve got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?""Speaker 1: Look, We have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, It's probably not a good idea to keep it up I'm willing to forgive and forget and if you are.""Speaker 2: Fine. Let's call a truce. I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down.""Speaker 2: What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year?""Speaker 1: Autumn is also very nice in Washington.""Speaker 2: Is it very cold in winter there?""Speaker 1: No, It isn't. But sometimes it snows a lot in winter.""Speaker 2: Does it rain a lot in summer there?""Speaker 1: Oh yes! Sometimes it rains very heavily. How about here in Beijing?""Speaker 2: There's a lot of rain in summer, But it seldom rains in autumn.""Speaker 1: I feel it's rather dry here.""Speaker 2: That's true. Many people from the south don't like the weather here.""Speaker 1: Are you from the south?""Speaker 2: No, I'm from the north. I was born in Beijing, Actually.""Speaker 2: Well, Qi is famous all over the world, Isn't he? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting.""Speaker 1: Cool! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer, Free sketch or claborate-style painting?""Speaker 2: I prefer free sketch, Especially the landscape paintings. I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings.""Speaker 1: That's true. Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature, Which is an important part of China's traditional culture.""Speaker 2: I love this art exhibition!""Speaker 1: So do I. Let's go to other areas to see what they have got, Shall we?""Speaker 2: And the streets are covered with snow.""Speaker 1: Do you know what the temperature is today?""Speaker 2: I missed today's weather forecast over the TV.""Speaker 1: It feels like ten degrees below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery.""Speaker 2: The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I am so fond of winter sports.""Speaker 2: Me too. Please write to me as soon as you get Boston.""Speaker 1: I'm sure and I remembered your phone number. I'll call you.""Speaker 2: Ok, They begin to register.""Speaker 1: It's time I left.""Speaker 2: What are your hours?""Speaker 2: I have a B. A. In Economics.""Speaker 1: Would you mind telling me how old you are?""Speaker 2: I'm twenty-seven.""Speaker 1: And could you tell me what other jobs you have had?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have worked in a bank for the last years.""Speaker 1: And what was your salary at the bank?""Speaker 2: A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it. If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face.""Speaker 2: Yes, I do. It's very interesting. What's your job?""Speaker 1: I'm a bus driver.""Speaker 2: Oh, Do you enjoy it?""Speaker 2: Thanks. Could you take one more from this angle?""Speaker 1: No problem.""Speaker 2: Now let's have one together.""Speaker 1: Do you know how to set the timer?""Speaker 2: Let me see... Set the timer first and push the button, Oh, Come here.""Speaker 1: Ok, Let's have a try.""Speaker 2: Cheese...""Speaker 1: Did it come out?""Speaker 2: Yes, But it's blurred and a little dark.""Speaker 1: Never mind. Let's go to the falls and try again.""Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't watch the football match. I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film.""Speaker 1: What a pity. It was quite exciting. Both teams played very well.""Speaker 2: How did it finish?""Speaker 1: It finished in a draw. What was the film like?""Speaker 2: It was quite good. But. I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first.""Speaker 1: Did your wife enjoy it?""Speaker 1: Are you sure she was trying to put you down?""Speaker 2: Of course, I am sure.""Speaker 1: You shall go easy on her. She is new here.""Speaker 2: Just how am I supposed to do that?""Speaker 1: You shall just take it in surprise.""Speaker 2: I've tried, But she keeps pushing my buttons.""Speaker 1: Try to pull it together, Vernassa. I am sure things will turn note, Ok?""Speaker 2: I am not. She is no picnic.""Speaker 1: Well. If you think I can help, Let me know.""Speaker 2: Aside from yourself, Who are the other members of the band?""Speaker 1: We have a guy who plays guitar, And another who plays bass. Although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, Right?""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm a singer.""Speaker 1: Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house.""Speaker 2: 1 thirty P.M. But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P.M.""Speaker 1: What airline and what flight?""Speaker 2: Pan American Airlines. Flight 282.""Speaker 1: I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P.M.""Speaker 2: Oh. So you think you can just do whatever you want, Do you?""Speaker 2: Eight.""Speaker 1: What time?""Speaker 2: Eight o'clock tonight, Would you please set us in a private room?""Speaker 1: So sorry, We're fully booked in that room. Would you like to make reservation some other time?""Speaker 2: Save it, Vince. After I put my first million in the bank, I'll say you're welcome.""Speaker 2: Wow. We don't get to see this in the city!""Speaker 1: Mother Nature is quite an artist.""Speaker 2: Look behind us at the mountains! They're reflecting pink!""Speaker 1: Amazing. The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere!""Speaker 2: Didn't I?""Speaker 1: You know you didn't.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm telling you now.""Speaker 1: Yes, But you might have told me before.""Speaker 2: I didn't think you'd be interested.""Speaker 1: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?""Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.""Speaker 2: He's been sick since he came back from Italy.""Speaker 1: Bummer, I'm sorry to hear that, Is he better now?""Speaker 2: He has the flu.""Speaker 1: Tell him I was asking about him.""Speaker 2: Certainly. After years of hard work, I wouldn't miss it. By the way, Where can I find cap and gown?""Speaker 1: Do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them?""Speaker 2: Oh, I think they're provided by the school for that special day.""Speaker 1: No. Those you have to provide for yourself.""Speaker 2: What do most of the students do?""Speaker 1: Well, Most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service, But some of the education majors have had them made, Because they will be faculty members, And they'll need them f.""Speaker 2: Then, I might as well have them made.""Speaker 1: Mary, Don't move. Stand right there. It's a good shot. The background is very pretty.""Speaker 2: Hold it a second. I want to fix my hairpin.""Speaker 1: It doesn't matter. Say'cheese '.""Speaker 2: Here's Lisa. May I take a picture with her?""Speaker 2: I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things. Most importantly, I practice every chance I get.""Speaker 1: It's a good idea to have a radio, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: Sure. It's like understanding on the telephone — — you can't see the speaker! It's great for improving listening comprehension.""Speaker 1: It takes a long time to learn a language, Doesn't it?""Speaker 2: Things couldn't be better. Where are you going now?""Speaker 1: I am heading for the library. I've got a research project to do. How about you?""Speaker 2: I'm going to the English class. It'll start in five minutes, I've got to run.""Speaker 1: See you later, Alligator.""Speaker 2: Water is rationed. We can only use a certain amount each month. It means that we cannot use some modern household items, Like washing machines. They use too much water.""Speaker 1: I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.""Speaker 2: Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, My country is more agricultural and has much less industry.""Speaker 1: We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, But cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced.""Speaker 2: The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.""Speaker 2: Charles? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here?""Speaker 1: It might work. I'll have to hear it. Show me what you'Ve done.""Speaker 2: It was horrible! I played play it much better at home!""Speaker 1: It's just nerves. Just play the right hand for now. One two three four five six, Ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, Good. Don't forget the accidentals! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b.""Speaker 2: Is that better?""Speaker 1: Yes, Much better. Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal. What was that?""Speaker 2: Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.""Speaker 2: Please don't tell my mom.""Speaker 1: Come on. Dating is a part of young people's social life. Besides, You're sixteen already.""Speaker 2: I'm glad that you see it that way.""Speaker 1: Do you want to borrow my coat? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you.""Speaker 2: Didn't they announce that our flight was delayed?""Speaker 1: I didn't hear anything about a delay. I thought everything was running on time. What happened?""Speaker 2: We boarded the plane on time, But then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem.""Speaker 1: Then what? Your plane was three hours late!""Speaker 2: We finally took off, But about 30 minutes later, The captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight.""Speaker 1: Turbulence is pretty normal, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: Yes, But this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life! Everyone started getting sick. The flight attendants had to stay in their seats. The captain decided to land early.""Speaker 1: So where did you land?""Speaker 2: We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again.""Speaker 1: That sounds like a nightmare!""Speaker 2: It wasn't too bad. At lease I'm alive.""Speaker 1: Have you had anything to eat?""Speaker 2: I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant. How about you?""Speaker 2: Don't worry about it. It's not new, It already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt?""Speaker 1: No, Thank you.""Speaker 2: That's the most important thing.""Speaker 1: It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid.""Speaker 2: Forget about it.""Speaker 1: When you lent me the bike, It looked brand new, Almost anyway.""Speaker 2: Maybe, But really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.""Speaker 2: It is hard to get used to a new place, Isn't it?""Speaker 1: Yes. Would you like to come here later to have a coffee? Bring all your family.""Speaker 2: We'd like to. Can you tell me when we go?""Speaker 1: About 4.""Speaker 2: Ok. Do you want us to bring something?""Speaker 1: No, Just come here.""Speaker 2: Ok, See you later.""Speaker 2: You can put on your shades. And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato. Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off. You may even wind up with skin cancer.""Speaker 1: I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good.""Speaker 2: Thank you. But I don't think I'll bother.""Speaker 1: Why not? What this article says makes good sense to me. If you read it, I'm sure you'll agree with me.""Speaker 2: You're going to do great. And you're going to look great.""Speaker 1: Thanks. Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion.""Speaker 2: I still like the olive one best. There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you.""Speaker 1: The question is, Can he have it done before Friday?""Speaker 1: But you like a girl to be rich, Surely?""Speaker 2: He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master! Quick! Get in line!""Speaker 2: You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose.""Speaker 1: In my book, All a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up.""Speaker 2: We're busy on weekdays, But we'll have a good rest at the weekend.""Speaker 2: I transferred from another school.""Speaker 1: Where did you transfer from?""Speaker 2: I was at PCC before.""Speaker 1: Why did you transfer?""Speaker 2: I was going to go here first, But my grades weren't good enough.""Speaker 1: Did you like it at PCC?""Speaker 2: PCC is an incredible school.""Speaker 1: Well, I wish you luck here.""Speaker 1: Of course not! She thinks he's an apple-head. She doesn't like an apple-headed man, You know.""Speaker 2: I have to exchange some money.""Speaker 1: That's right. You're going away next week.""Speaker 2: I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account. There was a problem last week.""Speaker 1: I have to pay my credit bill too. If I don't pay it soon, The credit card company will charge me interest.""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: Well, I hate the noise in the city, But I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don't go together.""Speaker 2: I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, But I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities.""Speaker 1: People can't have it both ways. If you live in the country, It is often less convenient. If you live in a city, It is noisy, But there's more to do.""Speaker 2: I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They're so much better to look at than concrete, Rows of parked cars and tall buildings.""Speaker 1: I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, You get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.""Speaker 2: The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There's so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.""Speaker 1: Just remember that in that village there's nothing to do. There's not even a pub or restaurant. There's just one small shop with a poor selection of goods.""Speaker 2: He took the civil service exam and failed.""Speaker 1: That sucks. He must feel depressed.""Speaker 2: Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days.""Speaker 1: Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him.""Speaker 2: That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else.""Speaker 1: Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done.""Speaker 2: We're happy together now. We both think that we're a well-matched couple.""Speaker 1: That's very good. It's said that marriage is the Ab of love. But the words may not be right.""Speaker 2: No, Not exactly, I'm working for minimum wage. And they don't give extra pay for overtime. Overtime is our own time.""Speaker 1: What?! Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights! If you are putting in so many hours, They should give you some kind of compensation.""Speaker 2: They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers, But frankly, It's not much of an incentive. They give us a bonus of ten dollars.""Speaker 1: That's just wrong! Why don't you just quit?""Speaker 2: I would, But I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job. I don't have very many job marketable skills, There aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for.""Speaker 2: All right. May I have your name?""Speaker 1: My surname is Gao.""Speaker 2: Oh, Breaktime flies.""Speaker 1: Come on, Baby. It's time now.""Speaker 2: Mam, Another minute, Could I?""Speaker 2: But my mother won't allow me to accept any part-time job. I'm afraid she will say no again.""Speaker 1: Why? It's unfair. You can learn a lot from it.""Speaker 2: She says a part-time job is cursed blessing. It takes so much time and energy that I won't be able to focus on my studys.""Speaker 1: That may be true. But I'm sure you're able to find a balance between them. Why not try it?""Speaker 2: I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake. But I'm a senior now, I don't want to miss the chance this time.""Speaker 1: I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind.""Speaker 2: I'll try, But what if she insists?""Speaker 1: Just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding. And more importantly, You can manage both your study and the job.""Speaker 2: Do you think it will work?""Speaker 1: Sure. Every cloud has its silver lining. Just try.""Speaker 2: Ok, I'll do that. Thank you, Iris.""Speaker 2: Twice a week. How about you?""Speaker 1: I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.""Speaker 2: What is very difficult to gather team player together.""Speaker 1: I usually play with my school-mates.""Speaker 2: Do you like watching football matches?""Speaker 2: I think that many physicians now agree with that idea.""Speaker 1: And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress.""Speaker 2: Yes, Actually it's my second visit. I was there last October.""Speaker 1: I see. What's it like there?""Speaker 2: Well, The life style is much more relaxed than here in the city. And the seafood is tastier!""Speaker 2: I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us.""Speaker 1: Hey, Daniel, What's your favorite weather? Snowy or sunny?""Speaker 2: Me? Er, I like hot weather, Just like today.""Speaker 1: What? Are you crazy?""Speaker 2: I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out.""Speaker 1: Ew, Danny, Gross!""Speaker 2: By the way, What's your favorite weather?""Speaker 1: I love snowy, Because it is very very romantic.""Speaker 2: Yes, I know, Sir. I'm sorry.""Speaker 1: Well, What's your excuse then?""Speaker 2: My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yes?""Speaker 2: Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here?""Speaker 1: Of course not. You know, There are many foreign customers like you here. And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English.""Speaker 2: Oh, Are you an English student? Or you just study English for interest's sake?""Speaker 1: No, I'm not an English student. But I do like English. I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language. So I try to improve my English.""Speaker 2: Very nice. Thank you for your time.""Speaker 1: Thank you, Sir. But I'm not allowed to accept any tips.""Speaker 2: Ok then. I don't want to put you in trouble.""Speaker 1: Well, Would you like something else? The new-made cafe parfait is really good. Want some?""Speaker 2: Ok. But I'd like some cookies.""Speaker 1: Sure. If you want more coffee, Please go over there. There is self-help coffee maker.""Speaker 2: I surely know that. Don't forget that I am a regular customer here.""Speaker 1: Oops. Well, Wait for a while. We'll get it done quickly.""Speaker 2: I think you can go to visit the museum. It's worth seeing. You can go to the square some other time.""Speaker 2: University? Why? You asked me last year.""Speaker 1: Oh, I forget. Sorry.""Speaker 2: I went to Harvard University.""Speaker 1: Did you? And what course did you take there?""Speaker 2: God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?""Speaker 1: I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.""Speaker 2: I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?""Speaker 2: Well. I'm rather disappointed with it.""Speaker 1: How come?""Speaker 2: It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected.""Speaker 1: Oh. It's awful, But it can't be helped.""Speaker 2: I'm not sure yet.""Speaker 1: Would you like to have lunch with me?""Speaker 2: Yes. When?""Speaker 1: Is 11:30 AM OK?""Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't hear you. Can you say that again please?""Speaker 1: I said, 11:30 AM.""Speaker 2: Oh, I'm busy then. Can we meet a little later?""Speaker 1: Ok, How about 12:30 PM?""Speaker 2: Ok. Where?""Speaker 1: How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant?""Speaker 2: Oh, Where is that?""Speaker 1: It's on 7th Street.""Speaker 2: Well, Yes. Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that. They are very supportive. I consulted an economic expert last week. He was very kind to give valuable suggestions.""Speaker 1: Now, The effort pays off. You have accomplished something.""Speaker 2: Ok. See you on Today.""Speaker 1: See you on Moday. Have a great weekend.""Speaker 2: The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now.""Speaker 2: I like the plot. It's so full of twists and turns. I also like the main character. She is so humorous and smart.""Speaker 1: What do you think of the ending?""Speaker 2: Yes, It's got wireless Internet access.""Speaker 1: That's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth?""Speaker 2: Yes, But I don't really use it often. Have you ever used it?""Speaker 1: No, But I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go.""Speaker 2: I'd be delighted to, John. Saturday did you say?""Speaker 1: Yes, If that's all right for you.""Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure I'll be all right. In fact, I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you. What time are you planning to start?""Speaker 1: Oh, Good. If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock, That would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner.""Speaker 2: I don't think I performed well.""Speaker 1: Oh! That's much hetter than I did.""Speaker 2: Can you tell me how to improve myself?""Speaker 1: There's no secret at all. The only thing for you to do is to practice more. You will succeed.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your encouragement.""Speaker 2: Take care and give my best to you parents.""Speaker 2: I know.""Speaker 1: Why? You make me confused.""Speaker 2: He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines, Read the political sections and return them later.""Speaker 1: Why does he have such a privilege?""Speaker 2: He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him.""Speaker 1: I see. Does he live by himself?""Speaker 2: Yes, He has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle.""Speaker 1: He must be lonely?""Speaker 2: I bet. But he is always busy telling the children stories.""Speaker 2: Yes, I have it.""Speaker 1: You're going to have to wait for a computer.""Speaker 2: That's okay.""Speaker 1: Please put your name on this list.""Speaker 2: Then what do I need to do?""Speaker 1: When there is a computer available, I will call you.""Speaker 2: What do I do to log on to the computer?""Speaker 1: Just type in the number on the back of your library card.""Speaker 2: August bride. How nice! By the way, Who is going to be the matron of honor?""Speaker 1: Mrs. White.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding. You know her father passed away several years ago.""Speaker 1: Maybe her uncle will.""Speaker 2: I think so. The wedding will be held at her church, Right?""Speaker 1: Right. Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding.""Speaker 2: Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon?""Speaker 2: Oh, Shut up, Will you? It was all your fault. If you'd kept quite this would never have happened.""Speaker 2: Well, I am under a lot of pressure. My boss is very pushy. He assigned me three projects. Now the deadlines are near, And I still have not finished all of my projects.""Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do to help you?""Speaker 2: What time do you want me there?""Speaker 1: Anytime after six will be fine.""Speaker 2: What's the color of her eyes?""Speaker 2: I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, Because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly.""Speaker 1: Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.""Speaker 2: Did she? That's great. However, If we have too many children, That will have a bad effect on the enviroment.""Speaker 1: How's your son these days?""Speaker 2: Oh, He's fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays.""Speaker 1: He'll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you think it is a good age to have a child?""Speaker 2: I had mine when I was 24. That's a little young. I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., Or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.""Speaker 1: Yes, I think you're right. I'm thinking about having a child, But not just yet.""Speaker 2: Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country?""Speaker 1: Yes, There is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, Have fun, And explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, But they don't often succeed.""Speaker 2: Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.""Speaker 2: No. They will tell you the same thing in a worse way.""Speaker 1: Did you register yet?""Speaker 2: Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss.""Speaker 1: What classes do you think are still open?""Speaker 2: Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, So there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology.""Speaker 1: That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.""Speaker 2: I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, So if you go to his office, You can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.""Speaker 1: He does that?""Speaker 2: I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class.""Speaker 1: That makes sense. I think I'll do that. Thanks for all the help.""Speaker 2: Don't worry. You have plenty of time to decide.""Speaker 1: And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition. I want to get the burden off my family.""Speaker 2: You always worry too much about everything. Take it easy, Honey. You are good enough. You can go to the ideal college.""Speaker 1: Ok, Ok. I'm so sorry. By the way, For you, Is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work?""Speaker 2: In a perfect world, I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much, And make lots of money!""Speaker 1: Ok, Honey, Stop dreaming. You should face the reality.""Speaker 2: That's only a joke. To be honest, I have to improve my English, Because my English is not good enough. I still get confused about some simple grammars. Since you are quite good at it, Do you have any suggestions?""Speaker 1: En, First you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class. Second, I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center.""Speaker 2: Is the training center helpful?""Speaker 2: Yes, They do. Do you have a Christmas tree this year?""Speaker 1: Yes, We have a big tree this year. I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday. Do you want to come and see it?""Speaker 2: I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother.""Speaker 1: When can you come?""Speaker 2: I've tried to give up smoking several times, But it's no good. Smoking relaxes me.""Speaker 1: Have you ever thought of just cutting down? You could do it gradually.""Speaker 2: It was about a married couple. They had to live with the wife's mother, Because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own.""Speaker 1: A lot of young people have to do that.""Speaker 2: Yes. But the husband had to work overtime three times a week, So he was always tired.""Speaker 1: Lt sounds like the story of my life.""Speaker 2: Yes, It does, Doesn't it? But this man was always over-tired, And he couldn't sleep. So he used to take two sleeping pill every night.""Speaker 1: I take sleeping pills sometimes.""Speaker 2: Yes, But not two every night. Anyway, The strain was too much for him. He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital.""Speaker 1: It sounds a very depressing film.""Speaker 2: Not really. His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter, Because she could speak French and German fluently. After a few months 'work, She had a better job than her husband. So in the end,""Speaker 2: Do we have enough time?""Speaker 1: It's a fifteen-minute intermission.""Speaker 2: The seats are excellent. We're right in the center.""Speaker 1: It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great.""Speaker 2: I can't agree more.""Speaker 1: Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert?""Speaker 2: In the United States, Yes. But back in China, I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents.""Speaker 1: Do you have large concert halls in your city?""Speaker 2: We have two. One is like this one. The other is a little smaller.""Speaker 2: Does it always close at six?""Speaker 1: No, Not every day.""Speaker 2: Will the library be open on Saturday?""Speaker 1: Absolutely.""Speaker 2: What are your hours on Saturday?""Speaker 1: Saturday's hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night.""Speaker 2: All right. Thank you.""Speaker 1: What else can I help you with?""Speaker 2: Zina, I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad.""Speaker 1: It isn't Elvin.""Speaker 2: Dave then? Dave is a spy for WebTracker? You can't be serious.""Speaker 2: Yes, The same as ever, Thanks. What about you?""Speaker 1: Pretty good, Thanks. I'm going to see my uncle.""Speaker 2: Good bye then, And keep in touch.""Speaker 2: I couldn't agree with you more.""Speaker 1: We should come here more often.""Speaker 2: You are absolutely right.""Speaker 1: I'd like to come back next weekend.""Speaker 2: Hey, Don't shout. Come here! Sit closer. Now, Jim, We'Ve had a lovely day. Don't spoil it now.""Speaker 1: What about your beautiful bathing suit? We shopped all day. Don't you want to show it off?""Speaker 2: Everybody who walks past me sees it. Besides, It's a good sunbathing suit.""Speaker 1: All right. Suit yourself. I am going swimming.""Speaker 2: Jim!""Speaker 1: Yes?""Speaker 2: Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair? I am really tired of lying in thousand.""Speaker 1: I've got a better idea. Why don't we hire a boat and go for a ride? What do you think?""Speaker 2: You mean the white building near the playground?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: That is the library. And it has more than 1, 000, 000 books.""Speaker 1: What's the building to the south of the library?""Speaker 2: You know, Our school is divided into two parts, The junior high school and the senior high school. That is the new classroom building for our senior high school.""Speaker 1: Is there a swimming pool in your school?""Speaker 2: Yes. There is a large swimming pool, But it is only available in summer.""Speaker 1: I do envy you. And I hope I can enter your school one day.""Speaker 2: Un... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see...Mm, It can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching.""Speaker 1: Aha, But how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get... Get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things... Best programmes that... That undoubtedly are on television?""Speaker 2: Well, I suppose one of the problems is... Will depend on what a person's life style is, And that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television, He will then, You know, Hmm. Be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things.""Speaker 1: Do you think though that... That in... In a sense television skilled people's own er... Sort of, Creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television?""Speaker 2: Are you planning on having someone take notes for you?""Speaker 1: Yes, I've got that part covered.""Speaker 2: When, Exactly do you need to leave?""Speaker 1: I don't need to leave until the very end of class.""Speaker 2: Fine, But next time try and not have to miss class again.""Speaker 1: Thanks, Professor. See you later!""Speaker 2: It's very dangerous, You know.""Speaker 1: I want to try something exciting.""Speaker 2: It's an easy way to get hurt, Let me tell you.""Speaker 1: I'll tell you all about it next Monday.""Speaker 2: Where are you from?""Speaker 1: I'm from Shanghai. And you?""Speaker 2: I was caught in the heavy rain, Or I would have come earlier. I am sorry I kept you waiting.""Speaker 1: I was in a comfortable place, So really, It's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long?""Speaker 2: Yes. When I came out of the subway, It was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up.""Speaker 2: It is the best season for a picnic right now. Have you decided the place for your picnic?""Speaker 1: We have decided to go to the park this Sunday. Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet?""Speaker 2: What did the whetherman say?""Speaker 1: He's predicting clear skies.""Speaker 2: I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I'm a junior, But...""Speaker 1: Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.""Speaker 2: I know, But the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field.""Speaker 1: Well, If you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.""Speaker 2: You're right, We do need leadership. But what we don't need is too many people to lead us. You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians...""Speaker 2: I like talking to writers, I get to meet a lot of interesting people.""Speaker 1: I'm happy to hear that, But publishing is more than just talking to writers. It involves a lot of work, Patience and responsibility. Most of the work is boring.""Speaker 2: I don't feel bored at all. I'm getting along with my colleagues. I will enjoy working with them. People are great in this industry.""Speaker 1: Do you have any complaints?""Speaker 2: No, I have no complaints. I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company. Is that true?""Speaker 1: Yes, You have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well.""Speaker 2: How do you do? Mr. Brown. I am Susan Heywood.""Speaker 1: Mr. Smith often talked about you.""Speaker 2: Really? I am glad to meet you.""Speaker 2: Certainly not.""Speaker 1: May I turn on the radio then?""Speaker 2: Turn on the radio? What for?""Speaker 1: So that we can sit down together and listen to some music.""Speaker 2: Listen to some music? And who'll cook dinner? Will you?""Speaker 1: Ok, I will. But let's go to a disco after dinner.""Speaker 2: I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. It's a real letdown.""Speaker 1: I don't think she would do such a thing.""Speaker 2: But she did and it made me disappointed.""Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up! A girlfriend is not everything.""Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.""Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.""Speaker 2: Let's buy some flowers, And pay her a visit.""Speaker 1: We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon.""Speaker 2: Come over and visit when you have time.""Speaker 2: Something like listening to music is a good idea.""Speaker 1: Oh, What kind of music do you listen to?""Speaker 2: Classic. Something that could calm your mind.""Speaker 1: I think that might work for me as well.""Speaker 2: Working out is another good way to relieve anger.""Speaker 1: Like what?""Speaker 2: You're like the tenth person to say that.""Speaker 1: We're just worried about you, Taylor.""Speaker 2: Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here. The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre.""Speaker 1: As the city grew, It must have absorbed many village nearby.""Speaker 2: Yes, It did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city.""Speaker 1: I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive. Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs. There was a castle near one village, So our city has a castle too.""Speaker 2: I'm not practicing enough.""Speaker 1: Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often?""Speaker 2: When I talk to Chinese, I always want to speak Chinese.""Speaker 2: I also need to check this magazine out.""Speaker 1: You're not allowed to do that.""Speaker 2: I don't understand.""Speaker 1: It's our policy.""Speaker 2: What can I check out?""Speaker 1: Only books or videos.""Speaker 2: I need this magazine.""Speaker 1: You will have to read it here.""Speaker 2: But that makes thirteen people! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!""Speaker 1: Why can't we?""Speaker 2: It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, Then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, And I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon.""Speaker 2: But we can't have thirteen for dinner!""Speaker 1: I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's only a superstition. It really doesn't mean anything.""Speaker 2: Absolutely not! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!""Speaker 1: Ok, Ok. I'll ask my sister to come. That way we'll have fourteen for dinner.""Speaker 2: Shirley, Do you know today's homework from our economic law class? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now.""Speaker 1: Hold on for a moment please. I'm fetching my textbook.""Speaker 2: Ok.""Speaker 1: Oh, The homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense.""Speaker 2: Explain the economic law? An essay question again?""Speaker 1: Yes. You can use your textbook for your reference.""Speaker 2: Are there any clear answers in the book to this question?""Speaker 1: I don't think so, Maria, But I think you can look for information on the Internet.""Speaker 2: Ok, Thank you, Shirley. You are very helpful. I have another question. When does the Economic Law of China come into effect?""Speaker 1: Oh, There isn't such a code called economic law. The Economic Law of China is a general concept for several laws.""Speaker 2: There isn't such a code?""Speaker 1: Yes, It's a general name for several laws related to economics, Like Commercial Law, And Law of Central Bank.""Speaker 2: Take care, And give my best to your parents.""Speaker 2: Let me have a look. Well, It lists some shows that will be on next week.""Speaker 1: Oh, Tell me about it. Anything interesting?""Speaker 2: Hmm... Oh, This one, 'The Drunken Beauty'. This is a real classic.""Speaker 1: ' The Drunken Beauty '? It's funny that we have' Sleeping Beauty 'in my country. Anyway, What's it about? Is the beauty a drunkard?""Speaker 2: Of course not. She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen. They play was famous for its singing and dancing.""Speaker 1: Sure, People do that when they are drunk. What about the actress?""Speaker 2: She is an opera star in China. Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang.""Speaker 1: Oh, I've heard about him before. He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking.""Speaker 2: You are such an expert on it. I don't know that.""Speaker 1: You know, Interest is the best teacher.""Speaker 2: So, Want me to book the tickets again?""Speaker 1: Please do that. I can't wait to come back again. The performance must be really amazing.""Speaker 2: We can do that if you like. Maybe next weekend.""Speaker 2: But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body.""Speaker 2: It's from NYU.""Speaker 1: What does it say?""Speaker 2: I didn't get accepted.""Speaker 1: You can't be serious!""Speaker 2: I'm serious.""Speaker 1: Are you all right?""Speaker 2: NyU was my first choice.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry that you didn't get in.""Speaker 2: Yes. I am going to take some university courses there.""Speaker 1: Sounds hard.""Speaker 2: Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.""Speaker 1: Won't you get lonely?""Speaker 2: I know. I could not believe it when i got hit by that storm. It was pouring with rain all afternoon.""Speaker 1: We really have some miserable weather sometime. I wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round.""Speaker 2: If it was sunning all year round there would be drought. You probably would not like it either.""Speaker 1: I guess you are right. Maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable.""Speaker 2: And a company car.""Speaker 1: Very nice.""Speaker 2: Yes, It is. But I'Ve got a lot of work too.""Speaker 2: Last night.""Speaker 1: Did you have a good journey?""Speaker 2: Yes, I enjoyed it very much.""Speaker 1: Where have you been on this trip?""Speaker 2: Let me see. Ah, Yes, I've been to England, France, Germany, Italy and now I've been in Spain.""Speaker 1: Really? How long will your holiday last?""Speaker 2: Two weeks.""Speaker 1: All these countries in two weeks?""Speaker 2: You'Ve got to be careful on the food you eat.""Speaker 2: Now that I look back at it, It wasn't that big a deal. I shouldn't have lost my temper.""Speaker 1: Really? What happened?""Speaker 2: It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, And we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, Said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip. I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all.""Speaker 1: That's pretty harsh.""Speaker 2: I know, But I was so upset. I mean, Come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says?""Speaker 1: You know she probably feels just as bad.""Speaker 2: Well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often.""Speaker 1: Well, In that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding. You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship. After all you can go to the beach anytime you want.""Speaker 2: You are wrong, Shirley. I was always absent-minded in the class. I meant to concentrate on the class, But I was just so tired. Maybe I am old.""Speaker 1: No. You are just burning yourself out these days. Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again.""Speaker 2: One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year. He filled the school column with his name, And his score was relinquished.""Speaker 1: How could he make such a silly mistake?""Speaker 2: He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years, And couldn't get used to it immediately. He was extremely nervous then.""Speaker 1: He lost a very good chance to go to college, Didn't he?""Speaker 2: Yeah. The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam. Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam. And there are fewer subjects.""Speaker 2: It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, But there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening.""Speaker 1: Like what?""Speaker 2: Well, We can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.""Speaker 1: What else can we do to protect the environment?""Speaker 2: If you do have to drive, You should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, Your home should use sources of renewable energy.""Speaker 1: How about recycling? Does that actually help?""Speaker 2: Yes. You should take your glass, Paper, Plastic, Cardboard, And tin cans to a recycling center.""Speaker 1: What do you think the biggest worry for our future is?""Speaker 2: I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone.""Speaker 1: I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before!""Speaker 2: I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping. What about you?""Speaker 1: I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party. Would you like to come?""Speaker 2: I'd love to. But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now. See you later.""Speaker 2: You like it, But it's getting to be a handicap for you.""Speaker 1: Hey, That's enough about my hair.""Speaker 2: I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too.""Speaker 1: I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute.""Speaker 2: Oh, They are fine. They are enjoying their retirement.""Speaker 1: Oh, Good. That's nice to hear. Well, I am going to a football match. I need to go.""Speaker 2: Say hi to your family for me.""Speaker 2: By the way, What's your last name? I forgot what it is.""Speaker 1: It's Lin. It's spelled L-I-N.""Speaker 2: R-I-N?""Speaker 1: My pronunciation is not very good. It's L-I-N, Lin.""Speaker 2: I got it. Mary Lin.""Speaker 2: Yes. I am ready.""Speaker 1: You're not nervous?""Speaker 2: Of course I'm nervous.""Speaker 1: What are you most nervous about?""Speaker 2: I won't know anybody at that school.""Speaker 1: You shouldn't be nervous about that.""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 1: Meeting new people is a good thing.""Speaker 2: Nah, Not too flashy.""Speaker 1: Hug! And this sweater from my aunt? Isn't it hideous?""Speaker 2: I guess.""Speaker 1: Are you even listening? I'm trying to have a conversation with you.""Speaker 2: And I'm trying to watch the game, But you're yapping on about your new clothes!""Speaker 1: Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon!""Speaker 2: Well could you do me the favor of making this quick? It's the third quarter and you'Ve been blabbering on since the first!""Speaker 1: Oh, Your precious game. You watch the same game every year, And each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals!""Speaker 2: Oh no you didn't. You didn't just insult theSals-bury Seals, Did you? Why don't you just. Just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?""Speaker 1: I might just! Enjoy your stupid game!""Speaker 2: And Merry Christmas!""Speaker 2: You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer?""Speaker 1: You can say that.""Speaker 2: But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them?""Speaker 1: They must have mixed hackers with crackers.""Speaker 2: What is crackers then?""Speaker 1: There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, But they aren't. They break into computers and break the phone system. Real hackers call these people crackers, And want nothing to do with them.""Speaker 2: So they are two totally different concepts.""Speaker 1: Well, The real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, Irresponsible and not very bright, And feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, Many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers. This irritates real hackers to no end.""Speaker 2: I see. Then the basic different is, Hackers build things, Crackers break them.""Speaker 1: You got it.""Speaker 2: Thanks a lot.""Speaker 2: But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?""Speaker 1: Yes, I probably could.""Speaker 2: You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups?""Speaker 1: Next class meeting.""Speaker 2: That will be soon enough, But make sure you get next week's assignment in as well, All right?""Speaker 1: That would work for me.""Speaker 2: According to the article, You have no real need to worry. Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts, Not on recreating a whole human.""Speaker 1: In the future, That could be possible.""Speaker 2: In this article, Scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person, There's no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original!""Speaker 1: Really? What else have you discovered?""Speaker 2: I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines. For example, An animal be immune to disease that affects human. So, Scientists find out why it's immune.""Speaker 2: That takes talent...""Speaker 1: I'm so humiliated! What's that man saying? Everyone's laughing!""Speaker 2: Why! What happened?""Speaker 1: Well. John had promised to be my date, But he stood me up. I waited for a full hour in the cold wind.""Speaker 2: So how long did you stay?""Speaker 2: Detached. You're literally detached from one planet, Captured by another. Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y, It stays in view the whole time.""Speaker 1: There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality. Is it going to be some future project that never happens?""Speaker 2: I believe it's certainly for real. It without question has suffered a lot of delays. But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December. It is a reality. It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground.""Speaker 1: There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission. It seemed to fizzle out. Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner?""Speaker 2: I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair, That it doesre-ignite people's interest to push on. But only time will tell.""Speaker 1: You had gone to the moon twice, Orbited space around the Earth lots of times, And of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have. How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness? I just can't wait.""Speaker 2: Twice a week. How about you?""Speaker 1: I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.""Speaker 2: But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together.""Speaker 1: I usually play with my schoolmates.""Speaker 2: Do you like watching football matches?""Speaker 1: Yes, I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday.""Speaker 2: I will.""Speaker 2: Thanks. I really appreciate it. In fact, I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship.""Speaker 1: What kind of scholarship is it?""Speaker 2: It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association. I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American.""Speaker 1: Fine. I know about that scholarship. You have to be a student in your junior year, And you have to have a grade point average of 3. 7 or higher.""Speaker 2: I'm a junior now, And my GPA is 3. 92.""Speaker 1: Excellent. So you'll have a good chance of getting it.""Speaker 2: Well, I hope so. The competition is probably pretty heavy. And they want a writing sample too.""Speaker 1: Do you have an essay you want to send them?""Speaker 2: No, They want a special essay. I must write an essay on a particular question they pose.""Speaker 1: What is the question?""Speaker 2: They give applicants a topic. The topic is, The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society. My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced.""Speaker 1: That's a pretty short essay.""Speaker 2: Yes, But I need to write it by next week.""Speaker 1: Good luck. I'm sure you will do a good job.""Speaker 2: I came here today to talk to you because... Well, I need to ask two favors.""Speaker 1: Sure. What are they?""Speaker 2: First, I need a letter of recommendation.""Speaker 1: I'd be happy to write one for you.""Speaker 2: And second... Well, I'm not sure if it's normal.""Speaker 1: What is it? Do you want me to read your essay?""Speaker 2: Yes, If you could. I mean, If you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes. Or maybe you'd have some suggestions.""Speaker 1: Of course I could read it. That's no problem. But you need to get it to me soon.""Speaker 2: I will. I want to write the first draft tonight. So I could bring it tomorrow morning.""Speaker 1: Alright. If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning, I can talk with you after class on Friday. So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend.""Speaker 2: That would really help me a lot. I'm very grateful.""Speaker 2: My car didn't want to start either at first.""Speaker 1: Don't you have a garage?""Speaker 2: Not in the new apartment. We have to leave the car in the parking lot.""Speaker 1: How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then? You must have to keep it well below zero.""Speaker 2: I do. Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero.""Speaker 1: Does it ever get that cold on here?""Speaker 2: Not really. It sometimes gets to 20 below.""Speaker 2: I couldn't agree with you more. There aren't enough educational programs, And even the news shows are not well done.""Speaker 2: Yes. He's one of my best friends. Our friendship formed at college. Why did you ask that?""Speaker 1: I'm going to London on business next week. But I know nothing about it.""Speaker 2: I get it. You want to find a guide, Don't you?""Speaker 1: Yes, Steven. You always know what I want.""Speaker 2: Don't worry. I will call Hanson, And ask him to help you.""Speaker 2: I'm worrying about my exam.""Speaker 2: Yes, I did.""Speaker 1: Oh, Did you know Hugh Young? He was a music student.""Speaker 2: Hugh Young? Didn't he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time?""Speaker 1: Yes. And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university.""Speaker 2: I remember Hugh. Most people thought he was a little... Uh... Peculiar. Do you know what he's doing now?""Speaker 1: Yes, He's a millionaire in Houston now.""Speaker 2: A millionaire? As a jazz musician?""Speaker 1: Oh, No. He's an executive for a large computer company. I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday. They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers.""Speaker 2: Thank you, Paul.""Speaker 1: By the way, Would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening? Tomorrow is my birthday.""Speaker 2: Good, Happy birthday to you!""Speaker 1: Not so soon. It's not my birthday today. Well, You'll come, Won't you?""Speaker 2: Sure, I will. Thank you for inviting me.""Speaker 2: Ok, Jason. So how was the flight?""Speaker 1: Pretty good. There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad. The worst thing was the guy behind me. He snored all through the night!""Speaker 2: Really? But you were in first class! Nobody woke that guy up?""Speaker 1: The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason.""Speaker 2: That's terrible! So you didn't get any sleep?""Speaker 1: Not much... But that's ok... I'm a night owl anyway.""Speaker 2: So, Aside from visiting our factory and offices, Are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China?""Speaker 1: I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall.""Speaker 2: I'm going to work with my father at the store. In the evening, I'll read books. On weekends, I'll go to the beach with my family.""Speaker 1: Have you ever worked?""Speaker 2: No, But I can learn. What are you going to do this summer?""Speaker 1: I'm going to camp. I've gone to camp for four summers.""Speaker 2: I've never gone to camp. What do you do there?""Speaker 1: We do many things. In the morning, We go swimming and boating. In the afternoon, We play basketball or tennis. We sit around a camp fire at night. We sing or tell stories.""Speaker 2: That sounds wonderful.""Speaker 1: It is wonderful. What's John going to do this summer?""Speaker 2: I think he's going to the mountains with his parents.""Speaker 1: Well, So long, Mary. Have fun.""Speaker 2: Can you tell which team seems to win?""Speaker 1: Hard to say. Now the score is in our favor.""Speaker 2: Yes. Our guest team is really tough.""Speaker 2: But you've been looking for that stamp for years.""Speaker 1: It's not worth it. Besides, I have to save up to pay for some bills.""Speaker 2: Bummer. I guess we're both out of luck.""Speaker 2: I heard it's a very good movie.""Speaker 1: Let's find out what time it starts.""Speaker 2: Let's look at the newspaper.""Speaker 1: Here it is. It starts at 8 o'clock.""Speaker 2: You don't need to lose weight, You are not fat.""Speaker 2: It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds.""Speaker 1: Absolutely. To be frank, I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas. I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days.""Speaker 2: Look at that big tree over there.""Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh my god! It's still there. We have our first date right on there.""Speaker 2: Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight.""Speaker 1: You were dull at that time.""Speaker 2: But you agreed to go out with me at last.""Speaker 2: That sounds boring to me.""Speaker 1: What do you plan on doing after you retire?""Speaker 2: Yes, I think I will do something new. I'Ve always wanted to be a teacher.""Speaker 2: Any time is fine.""Speaker 1: Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock?""Speaker 2: Please wait for us even if we're a little late.""Speaker 1: Never mind. I'll be waiting for you.""Speaker 2: See you then.""Speaker 2: Just what? Stop beating around the bush. Tell me what you want to know.""Speaker 1: I... Er... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks.""Speaker 2: Lend you a few bucks? No way! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time?""Speaker 2: Laura.""Speaker 1: Do you like this place?""Speaker 2: I don't think it's very nice. And my father doesn't like it. But my mother likes it very much. So we often come here.""Speaker 1: How often?""Speaker 2: Well, We come here almost every month.""Speaker 1: Who's that?""Speaker 2: It's my mother. She's fond of swimming. And the man beside her is my father.""Speaker 1: Do you like swimming?""Speaker 2: There are about 30 million people in my country. Most of them live in the north.""Speaker 1: What's the average income?""Speaker 2: That's the really hard to say. I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month, If you convert the money from our currency into dollars.""Speaker 1: So your country is fairly rich.""Speaker 2: I think we are richer than most countries, But not as rich as countries in western Europe. Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment, Which is roughly 8 %. It has doubled over the last four years.""Speaker 2: I think we picked the right line. This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others.""Speaker 1: Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food.""Speaker 2: You were playing it very late last night.""Speaker 1: Yeah?""Speaker 2: It kept me awake.""Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.""Speaker 2: It kept me awake a couple of hours.""Speaker 1: I'm so sorry, I .. I didn't realize it was that loud.""Speaker 2: It was that loud, And it was pretty late, And check with Mary if you don't believe me.""Speaker 1: It's true. It was a bit loud.""Speaker 2: I'm very sorry. I didn't realize it. I promise I'll keep it down in the future.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's no problem. It's OK. You know, It only happened once.""Speaker 2: I enjoy oil painting. I learned it in one of my extra classes in college.""Speaker 1: That sounds so interesting. I wish I learned a hobby.""Speaker 2: Hobbies are never too late to learn. They offer a variety of classes at the local community college. You should look into it.""Speaker 2: It couldn't be better. My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much.""Speaker 1: You're so lucky. I hope to get married to a guy like that.""Speaker 2: I'm so happy. Even though we are both working, We get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends.""Speaker 1: Do you guys do anything special?""Speaker 2: In the evening, We just sit and talk over dinner. But on the weekend, We try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant, Or go to a nice cafe.""Speaker 2: I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. It's a real letdown.""Speaker 1: I don't think she would do such a thing.""Speaker 2: But she did and it made me disappointed.""Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up! A girlfriend is not everything.""Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.""Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.""Speaker 2: I am also impressed with the lines in the movie.""Speaker 1: Life is like a box of chocolates, You never know what you're gonna get.""Speaker 2: That's my favorite.""Speaker 1: You know, It also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995. Unbelievable!""Speaker 2: It deserves. That film can give us a lot of inspiration.""Speaker 1: Yes, The Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble.""Speaker 2: All in all, It will never lose its appeal.""Speaker 1: Gucci, I have an idea. Do you want to see this movie together?""Speaker 2: He said there are only all kinds of good weather.""Speaker 1: Okay, Pollyanna, What's so good about this weather?""Speaker 2: Well, For one, We have an excuse to stay home.""Speaker 1: We 'get' to stay home? Do you know something that I don't?""Speaker 2: Isn't it a Sunday?""Speaker 1: No, It's a Monday.""Speaker 2: So you are leaving two weeks from now?""Speaker 2: He does. He's good at this genre too. It's a captivating read.""Speaker 1: We're going to the bookshop. Would you like to join us?""Speaker 2: Yes, I would. I need to buy a textbook for my course and, As you know, I love browsing through the latest paperbacks.""Speaker 1: Me too. I need something to read on the flight to new york. I can never sleep on planes. Sarah wants to pick up some children's books for her daughter.""Speaker 2: I want to look at nelson Mandela's autobiography.""Speaker 2: BBS means Bulletin Board Service.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see, But what's it used for?""Speaker 2: A lot of things!""Speaker 1: Tell me in details.""Speaker 2: Okay. BBS, An online service, Offers a wide variety of online games, Files, One-on-one chat, Message areas, Private mail, And participate forums.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's great. I want to try later.""Speaker 2: Take it easy. It is all over now. How was it going, Anyway?""Speaker 1: I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, But they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, The manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me.""Speaker 2: That's strange. But probably, It is the new interview technique they call it 'Getting to know you more personally'. What about your answers?""Speaker 2: The cover came off.""Speaker 1: You're going to need to pay for the damage.""Speaker 2: How much are you talking?""Speaker 1: It's going to be $ 5.""Speaker 2: That's not bad at all.""Speaker 1: It really isn't.""Speaker 2: Here you go.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: If you refuse to take risk, You can't have better returns.""Speaker 2: Certainly not. What really counts is to play as a team, Passing the ball amongst each other, Dodging defenders. Free kicks are a result of all the teammates 'collective efforts. However, A few free kicks often make everything different, Especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time.""Speaker 1: In the case, Maybe facial charm should be his leading card. After all, The majority of his fans are girls.""Speaker 2: Yes, His face looks are manly, With a straight nose and infinite eyes. As a man of medium height in the West, He keeps a powerful but elegant figure, Looking neither lanky nor stout.""Speaker 2: Come by any time.""Speaker 1: Shall I say around ten o'clock?""Speaker 2: When will we get one of those?""Speaker 2: I am very happy, Too. It was a big game and I won.""Speaker 1: I watched the race with my children. We saw you run to the finish line. We all screamed with excitement.""Speaker 2: You did? Do tell me. I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it, But I've made little progress!""Speaker 1: Sure. I'm learning Chinese through songs.""Speaker 2: So you're learning Chinese songs?""Speaker 1: You can say that. I can actually sing some of them now.""Speaker 2: That's a real achievement. How did you do that?""Speaker 1: I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer.""Speaker 2: It makes sense.""Speaker 1: It does. I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way. They are clearly presented and easy to follow.""Speaker 2: Can Join you, Katherine? I do want to have a try.""Speaker 1: Why not? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day. We can learn it together now.""Speaker 2: Great. Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary?""Speaker 1: Yes, Just in case we run into me new characters.""Speaker 2: From China.""Speaker 1: Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, If you don't mind me saying so.""Speaker 2: It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, Visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.""Speaker 1: Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, How old are you?""Speaker 2: Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?""Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!""Speaker 2: Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, And what about yourself?""Speaker 1: I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S of A, Although I have some Colombian heritage.""Speaker 2: Really? That's great! Do you speak some Spanish?""Speaker 1: Uh... Yeah .. of course!""Speaker 2: Like what?""Speaker 1: Well, Sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community. You'd have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day, But you would definitely save money doing it that way.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Do you know anyone who has done that before?""Speaker 1: Sure, My sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way. They're pretty satisfied with it.""Speaker 2: Is the house pretty run-down.""Speaker 1: Not at all. The woman, Who owned it, Took good care of it. But when she died, She had no family left and no will, So the government had to sell it for her.""Speaker 2: Was it a very old house?""Speaker 1: It was about 75 years old. There were a few repairs that needed doing, But it didn't take a lot of money or time.""Speaker 2: Is it in a good location?""Speaker 2: Yes, He does. He is a science fiction writer.""Speaker 1: Does Jim need to make more money?""Speaker 2: Afraid so. The more the better.""Speaker 1: What do they need all that money for?""Speaker 2: Well, They spend it pretty quick. New clothes, New computers and new cars every year. And they'Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress, She likes to spend a lot of money.""Speaker 1: Do they have any children?""Speaker 2: No. They want children but no luck yet.""Speaker 1: What does Jim like to do?""Speaker 2: Jim likes to travel around the world. That's expensive! So he tries to make a lot of money.""Speaker 1: What does Mona like to do?""Speaker 2: Oh, She enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses, And she has quite a bit of jewelry.""Speaker 1: Wow... She sounds like a high maintenance wife.""Speaker 2: I guess so. She is also interested in politics. She knows everyone in city government.""Speaker 1: Politics can be an expensive hobby.""Speaker 2: She is pretty serious about it. Her uncle is a mayor. She wants to follow in his footsteps.""Speaker 1: Politics is a hard game to play.""Speaker 2: She said I have a fever but nothing major.""Speaker 1: In that case, You should go home and get plenty of rest.""Speaker 2: What if this small fever turns into a big fever?""Speaker 2: She was patient, Kind, Fun, Smart, Caring, And yet strict, Too. I really learned a lot from her.""Speaker 1: What kind of things did you learn?""Speaker 2: She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do.""Speaker 1: Anything? Do you really believe that we can do anything?""Speaker 2: If you really want to do something and you work hard at it, I believe you can do it.""Speaker 1: You said she was strict. Did she have a lot of rules?""Speaker 2: She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable. For example, The students had to treat each other with respect, Or they would be disciplined.""Speaker 1: I see. She sounds like she really cared about her students.""Speaker 2: Yes. She treated us all fairly. She don't have any teacher's pets.""Speaker 1: Really? Doesn't every teacher have a teacher's pet?""Speaker 2: Well. To be honest, I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades. However, Miss Baymler didn't treat me any differently. She really didn't have any teacher's pets.""Speaker 1: Do you know what she is doing now?""Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I do. After she taught our class, She got married and moved to another city. Then, She started writing children's book.""Speaker 1: Have you ever read one of the books?""Speaker 2: Of course! Both children and adults enjoy her books.""Speaker 1: Why don't you recommend one to me?""Speaker 2: Oh, Thank you for pointing that out. By the way, Have you been following NBA for this season?""Speaker 1: Of course, Tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game.""Speaker 2: Who plays who?""Speaker 1: Rockets vs Lakers. Yao Ming, My idol, Will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience.""Speaker 2: It's amazing. And when did he begin to play in the NBA?""Speaker 1: In 2002. And since then he has attracted more attention than ever.""Speaker 2: I can't consider you as a little kid any more. I know he is very tall.""Speaker 1: Oh, You know something. He is 2. 26 meters tall. But he is also nimble and skillful.""Speaker 2: I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game.""Speaker 1: Yes, What's worse is he can't take any further part in the game.""Speaker 2: That's really terrible. Oh, God, We forgot to cheer for Daddy.""Speaker 1: Never mind. After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming, Right?""Speaker 2: You're having me on again.""Speaker 2: Thirteen today and tomorrow. Fourteen the day after tomorrow.""Speaker 1: How time flies! He's a big boy now.""Speaker 2: And don't forget Mary, Tom's twin sister. It's her birthday, Too.""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: She passed out in class. Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days.""Speaker 2: Why on earth would she do that? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days? That's crazy!""Speaker 1: Yeah, But that's what she did.""Speaker 2: I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies. And all for a certain look.""Speaker 1: Well, It's not just the girl's fault. It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying, It's in to be thin. It's hard for them not to listen.""Speaker 2: Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel.""Speaker 1: You haven't had any experience in either of those fields.""Speaker 2: My name is Bill. How are your lessons going?""Speaker 1: Very well. And my favorite subject is Chinese.""Speaker 2: I prefer to learn English. In my opinion, English is easier than Chinese.""Speaker 1: I guess English has fewer characters.""Speaker 2: Mrs. Smith, What do you do for work?""Speaker 1: I'm a doctor.""Speaker 2: Oh. Where do you work?""Speaker 1: New York University hospital in New York City. What do you do?""Speaker 2: I'm a teacher.""Speaker 1: What do you teach?""Speaker 2: I teach English.""Speaker 1: Where?""Speaker 2: At a high school in New Jersey.""Speaker 1: That's nice. How old are you?""Speaker 2: Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you. So get out there, Tiger!""Speaker 1: Was she really? So you're telling me there's a chance?""Speaker 2: It's once in blue moon.""Speaker 1: What do you think is the real danger man faced in space?""Speaker 2: Oh, Really? So, Spain is through to the next round?""Speaker 2: I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus. It may offer you many benefits. First, It's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate. While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising, A bike ride to work not only builds you up, But also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep out for a longer hour.""Speaker 1: I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, It's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, Polled air on the road?""Speaker 2: Eighteen.""Speaker 1: What about your sister?""Speaker 2: She's not quite twenty-five.""Speaker 1: Do you miss your family?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: Do you often go home?""Speaker 2: No. But I often send e-mail to them. And make a call to my parents regularly.""Speaker 1: How often do you call to them?""Speaker 2: And nobody knows who built them, Right? It's a total mystery!""Speaker 2: But promise me, You'll keep it a secret.""Speaker 1: Ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?""Speaker 2: I've fallen in love with my boss.""Speaker 1: Really? Is he married?""Speaker 2: Bo, Of course not. He is still single.""Speaker 1: Then what's your problem?""Speaker 2: I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip.""Speaker 2: Worse still, He is trying to avoid me these days.""Speaker 1: Office romance is very tricky.""Speaker 2: It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.""Speaker 2: I also need to check these books out.""Speaker 1: Anything else?""Speaker 2: That's everything.""Speaker 1: I need your library card.""Speaker 2: I have it. Here you go.""Speaker 1: Do you need anything else?""Speaker 2: That's everything.""Speaker 1: Your books are due back two weeks from today.""Speaker 2: I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish.""Speaker 1: I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries.""Speaker 2: So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary?""Speaker 1: It says that traditionally, Give something made of paper.""Speaker 2: So what?""Speaker 1: You know how much I want to be on the team, And now there is an opening for me. If I don't go to practise today. They'll get someone else and I'll miss my chance.""Speaker 2: I don't care about baseball. You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday, And I did.""Speaker 1: I know, And I will.""Speaker 2: When?""Speaker 1: After baseball practice.""Speaker 2: And then, It'll be dinner time, Then homework, And then your Show is on. You are going to break your promise.""Speaker 1: No, I won't. I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you.""Speaker 2: Well, I'd rather do it the way we set up. But if you promise to give me your best game, It's ok with me.""Speaker 2: Well, During school, They wanted good grades. Then after I got a job, They wanted me to get a better job. And finally, They want me to get married.""Speaker 1: You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents.""Speaker 2: Your parents are not like that?""Speaker 1: Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, They never expected much.""Speaker 2: You're lucky.""Speaker 1: What do you do to deal with the stress?""Speaker 2: Not much I can do. It's always there. I sometimes go out with some friends and drink, But that's only a temporary solution. The stress always returns in the morning.""Speaker 1: That sucks. You wanna go grab a beer?""Speaker 2: Okay. It looks like rain.""Speaker 1: Why do you say that?""Speaker 2: The sky is gray.""Speaker 1: Is it raining right now?""Speaker 2: No.""Speaker 1: How do you know?""Speaker 2: The street isn't wet.""Speaker 1: I have to go shopping today.""Speaker 2: Yeah! I just started my training today and I'm not really sure where to begin.""Speaker 1: It's ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper body, Mainly your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?""Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio.""Speaker 1: In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be enough. Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.""Speaker 2: Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting? My goodness that's a lot of weight!""Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't think I can.""Speaker 1: Friday then. How about it?""Speaker 2: Friday is great.""Speaker 2: Well, I missed several buses.""Speaker 1: How on earth can you miss several buses?""Speaker 2: I, Ah..., I got have late.""Speaker 1: Oh, Come on, Gordon, It's the afternoon now. Why were you late really?""Speaker 2: Well, I... I lost my wallet, And I...""Speaker 1: Have you got it now?""Speaker 2: Yes, I found it again.""Speaker 1: When?""Speaker 2: This morning. I mean...""Speaker 2: Right, It was a chick flick, Just like this one, So what's the difference? Besides, This is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen. Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah, And I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week. But you liked that movie, Didn't you?""Speaker 2: Oh, Sure, It was great. I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap.""Speaker 1: It wasn't that bad, And you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner. We went to an excellent restaurant.""Speaker 2: That place doesn't have a single meat dish. Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much.""Speaker 1: And I don't like meat that much. The only meat I eat is chicken.""Speaker 2: But when I pick the restaurant, We go to a place that has both chicken and fish. I always respect your food preferences.""Speaker 1: Well, I suppose that, To be fair, You should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat.""Speaker 2: She's not bad. She's a bit bossy, But I'm sure I'll get used to her.""Speaker 1: Would you rather have her or your old boss back?""Speaker 2: She's far better than my old boss. He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down.""Speaker 1: How about your new co-workers?""Speaker 2: They are all pretty easy-going. It's a very friendly place to work.""Speaker 1: Do you miss your old co-workers?""Speaker 2: Of course. I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well. They were like family to me.""Speaker 1: Do people in different departments get along with each other?""Speaker 2: Sure. Since we work together in teams, We have to get along with each other.""Speaker 1: Do you like working in teams with people from different departments?""Speaker 2: Yes, It helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives.""Speaker 1: Do you like working in teams?""Speaker 2: I'd love to. What date is it?""Speaker 1: It's May 1st.""Speaker 2: What day is that?""Speaker 1: It's Saturday. Could you make the time?""Speaker 2: Yes, Sure. What time will the wedding begin?""Speaker 1: At nine sharp.""Speaker 2: Very good! I'm looking forward to it. Please give my best regards to John. And I wish you best luck!""Speaker 2: If he doesn't understand me, I'll show him the office address on my business card.""Speaker 1: Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late?""Speaker 2: Yes, I adore simple fashions. How does it look on me?""Speaker 1: It looks great, But you need something to go with it. It's too plain on its own.""Speaker 2: How about this blue sweater?""Speaker 1: That's a good idea. When did you buy it? Is it a name brand?""Speaker 2: Yes, But I bought it when it was on sale, 50 % off the original price. Ok, What do you think?""Speaker 1: That looks lovely. Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings.""Speaker 2: I've got a pair of pearl earrings. Here it is.""Speaker 1: Perfect!""Speaker 2: You have good fashion sense, Karen.""Speaker 1: Thanks. We should be ourselves. There are so many fashion victims out there.""Speaker 2: This show is like a black Friends.""Speaker 1: BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV.""Speaker 2: It must be hard being a father.""Speaker 1: No, It's great being a father, Seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you.""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump.""Speaker 1: Well have a good time. Get me some autographs if you can.""Speaker 2: Twice a week. How about you?""Speaker 1: I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.""Speaker 2: But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together.""Speaker 1: I usually play with my schoolmates.""Speaker 2: Do you like watching football matches?""Speaker 2: Well, It's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today. We'Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah, And we're calling for scattered showers throughout the day, With a day-time high of forty-five degrees. Now, If we move down to the south of the state, We can see that a cold front is moving in. We can expect clear skies, But it will be quite cold, With temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark.""Speaker 1: It's a chilly day folks, So don't forget your coats! What about tomorrow Kenny? Do you have good news for us?""Speaker 2: Well, It'll be a rainy day for Northern Utah. We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning. Winds will be coming in from the North East, With gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour. Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening. Things are looking a bit better for the South. We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers. Later in the day, We can expect partlycloudy skies, With a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees.""Speaker 1: You heard it folks! It's gonna be a cold one!""Speaker 2: Don't give up so soon.""Speaker 1: But I don't know what else I can do. I am willing to work hard. Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy.""Speaker 2: Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from.""Speaker 1: Tell that to my boss.""Speaker 2: Do you know Abraham Lincoln?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling, But he went on to become the President of United States.""Speaker 1: He was also assassinated because of his views.""Speaker 2: He is known as American's greatest president. Do you know why? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything. He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit.""Speaker 1: Well, If he can become president, Then I can at least get a promotion.""Speaker 2: Pleased to meet you. My name is Alice. Did you just move in next door?""Speaker 1: Yes, I did. Have you lived here long?""Speaker 2: Me? I guess so. I've lived here for about six years now. Have you lived in America very long?""Speaker 1: No, Not really. When I left Vietnam, I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years. Where do you work, Alice?""Speaker 2: I teach mathematics at a college. What do you do?""Speaker 1: I am an accountant at a company.""Speaker 2: Well, Tom. It's good to meet you. I have to go now. I am teaching a class this evening, And I need to get to the college.""Speaker 1: It's nice meeting you too, Alice.""Speaker 2: See you around!""Speaker 2: Let me take a look at this for you. May I have your driver's license, Please?""Speaker 1: Here's my license and form.""Speaker 2: You seem to have filled the form out all right. Are you familiar with our rules and fines?""Speaker 1: Yes, I know what to do.""Speaker 2: The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout.""Speaker 1: Ok.""Speaker 2: That's right. I report to work at 5am everyday, And I only get 45 minutes for lunch.""Speaker 1: So, Why did you apply for such a demanding job?""Speaker 2: Well, The government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance, Too?""Speaker 2: Yeah, That's the best part. All of my children can get free medical care.""Speaker 1: That's a great employment benefit!""Speaker 2: Right. Unless, Who know what will happen.""Speaker 2: Well, It's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language. That kind of gets on my nerves.""Speaker 2: Honey, Cheer up.""Speaker 1: I feel confused about the grammars.""Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best.""Speaker 1: And my writing is not good. I feel so frustrated.""Speaker 2: Be confident, And never give up.""Speaker 1: I know that, Mom. But sometimes I'm just sad.""Speaker 2: Keep your chin up. Remember? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.""Speaker 2: Yes. I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa.""Speaker 1: Do you know where the visa office is?""Speaker 2: No.""Speaker 1: It's just near the Dong Si ShiTiao subway stop.""Speaker 2: That's not too far away. Do you think I'll get a visa?""Speaker 1: Have you ever gone abroad before?""Speaker 2: Yes, I've been to Tailband, Egypt, And Japan.""Speaker 1: Have you ever been denied a visa before?""Speaker 2: Never.""Speaker 1: That's good. Are you planning on immigrating to another country?""Speaker 2: No, I want to come back to China after I graduate.""Speaker 1: That's exactly what the visa officers want to hear. Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board?""Speaker 2: I've received a full scholarship, So I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying.""Speaker 1: I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa. I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want.""Speaker 2: No, I've been coming for the last 3 years. Each year keeps getting better. Where are you from?""Speaker 1: I'm from Long Island, New York. What about yourself?""Speaker 2: I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles.""Speaker 1: Wow. I really like California... The weather there is much better than the East Coast.""Speaker 2: Have you been to California?""Speaker 1: Just once. Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation. They had a blast.""Speaker 2: How many kids do you have?""Speaker 1: Two, A boy and a girl. They're already grown now.""Speaker 2: Here are all of them.""Speaker 1: These books are two weeks late.""Speaker 2: I didn't have time to return them.""Speaker 1: You're going to have to pay late fees.""Speaker 2: How much?""Speaker 1: 25 cents a day.""Speaker 2: 25 cents a day?""Speaker 1: That means 25 cents for each late book.""Speaker 2: Me, Too. What did you have in mind?""Speaker 1: I haven't decided yet, But I think the OlympicMascots are a must.""Speaker 2: I agree. They're very lovely, Especially Huanhuan.""Speaker 1: Is that the red one? That is my favorite, Too. Do you know how much they are?""Speaker 2: The five dolls are sold together as a set, And they're priced according to the size. The bigger they are the more expensive.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. If I buy more than a set, Can I get any discount?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now.""Speaker 1: Any other ideas?""Speaker 2: There are lots of things, Such as postcards, Key chains, Posters and various arts and crafts.""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: I just got off the subway. I'm almost there. Sorry I'm late.""Speaker 2: That's no problem. I just wanted to tell you I'm inside.""Speaker 1: Where are you?""Speaker 2: On the second floor.""Speaker 1: Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor?""Speaker 2: Come upstairs.""Speaker 1: What?""Speaker 2: Oh, Can you hear me OK? I said, Come to the second floor.""Speaker 1: Oh, Ok. What are you doing there?""Speaker 2: Just looking at some books on how to learn English.""Speaker 1: Do you want to get something to eat later?""Speaker 2: No, I'm still full from dinner.""Speaker 1: What do you want to do?""Speaker 2: I don't know for sure. When you get here we'll talk about it.""Speaker 1: Ok, See you soon.""Speaker 2: Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end.""Speaker 1: How do you think they could be ended?""Speaker 2: I don't think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that.""Speaker 1: So, If the cause is poverty, There should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, Share them.""Speaker 2: It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, It's harder to make peace between countries.""Speaker 1: Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive.""Speaker 2: You're right, But you know, It's hard to give up an old habit.""Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.""Speaker 2: You know, I often have to work til late at night. I need something to keep me awake.""Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.""Speaker 2: I have no choice. My mother is always very strict with me.""Speaker 1: Don't complain about it. She is concerned about your safety.""Speaker 2: According to the newspaper, The town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake.""Speaker 1: It's horrible.""Speaker 2: Yeah, We have to do something to help the people in the stricken area.""Speaker 1: Yes. How about donating some money?""Speaker 2: It's a good idea. But where can we donate money?""Speaker 1: Just find the answer through Internet.""Speaker 2: She's very nice.""Speaker 1: What does she teach?""Speaker 2: English, Of course.""Speaker 1: Is she your teacher?""Speaker 2: Yes. She teaches our class three times a week.""Speaker 1: Can she speak Chinese to her students?""Speaker 2: Not very much.""Speaker 2: Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company.""Speaker 1: Really? I'm surprised.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time.""Speaker 1: Oh, I am sorry. Maybe you were just emotional at that moment. Do you think you guys can get back together?""Speaker 2: I don't know. There's plenty of fish out there in the sea!""Speaker 2: You were really lucky.""Speaker 1: My birthday comes next month. I want to hold a birthday party, Too.""Speaker 2: I'm proud of you for standing by her. I think you've helped make a big difference in her life.""Speaker 1: Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening?""Speaker 2: No, Why?""Speaker 1: My friend, Who had the mishap, Wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her.""Speaker 2: She doesn't need to do that, I didn't do anything.""Speaker 2: I couldn't either at first, But you get used to it.""Speaker 1: It's so hot at lunchtime ; I'd rather run in the morning.""Speaker 2: Well, Why don't you come tomorrow? I'll stop by your house on my way out.""Speaker 1: I could try, But I can't say for sure if I'll get up in time. What time do you want to go?""Speaker 2: I'll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty.""Speaker 1: O. K., Maybe if I have someone to go with, I'll be able to get up in time for a jog.""Speaker 2: Great, I'll see you then.""Speaker 2: I doubt it.""Speaker 2: And you got them off the Net?""Speaker 1: No. I recorded these from your Cds.""Speaker 2: Well, Thanks for asking for my permission... Now hand it over and let me record!""Speaker 2: Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, But Mary's short hand is the best in her class.""Speaker 1: How about languages?""Speaker 2: Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does.""Speaker 2: Nothing much. What about you? Is everything going well?""Speaker 1: Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii.""Speaker 2: How was it?""Speaker 1: I had a good time. You seem to be in a hurry. Don't let me hold you up.""Speaker 2: Sorry, I've got a meeting in half an hour.""Speaker 1: Ok, I won't keep you then.""Speaker 2: Great! It's good to see you. Goodbye!""Speaker 1: Yes, Stay in touch. Bye!""Speaker 2: Give me your email, Would you?""Speaker 2: Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.""Speaker 1: Yeah but, He is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, He always shuts down and brushes me off.""Speaker 2: Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, Anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.""Speaker 1: I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know...""Speaker 2: Talk to him, Try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!""Speaker 2: This is a small town, And we like to be neighborly. We know everyone who lives around here.""Speaker 1: Well, I'm from Chicago. There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors.""Speaker 2: So, Tell me, Karl, Why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live?""Speaker 2: Not really. I couldn't careless about the Olympic Games.""Speaker 2: Looks like you're going to lose out on this game then.""Speaker 1: I can't believe it! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure.""Speaker 2: What were the odds?""Speaker 1: 20 to 1, In favour of the Cougars!""Speaker 2: Saturday my parents are coming to town. What's up?""Speaker 1: What about tonight? Do you have plans tonight?""Speaker 2: No, Do you want to go and do something?""Speaker 1: Yes, Yes, I want to take you to dinner.""Speaker 2: Okay, Susan. It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year. Is this information correct?""Speaker 1: Yes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.""Speaker 2: Sure. That's not a problem. Do you have the list of courses you want totaketh semester?""Speaker 1: Yeah. Here's my list. I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.""Speaker 2: Yeah, That's perfect. What about the subjects for your minor?""Speaker 1: Oh yeah! Almost forgot! I need to take fundamental linguistics, Consumer psychology and neuroanatomy.""Speaker 2: Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here. The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre.""Speaker 1: As the city grew, It must have absorbed many village nearby.""Speaker 2: Yes, It did. The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city.""Speaker 1: I see. Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Several of the buildings from the villages still survive. Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs. There was a castle near one village, So our city has a castle too.""Speaker 2: Well, French was my best subject at school. I can read and write it pretty well.""Speaker 1: And how about your Spanish?""Speaker 2: Well, It's not as good as my French. I can speak it reasonably well, But my written Spanish isn't very good.""Speaker 1: I see. Well, We have a lot of Spanish customers, But you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here.""Speaker 2: Yep! The nick name for your zone, Address, Gender and so on. Some of them are privacy, So you have the right to keep secret here.""Speaker 1: All information is filled in and now I can design my zone.""Speaker 2: You can choose one type to make it as your background, And then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it, So your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone.""Speaker 1: Now everything is OK. I can write my blog, Right?""Speaker 2: Certainly.""Speaker 1: ( Half an hour, Janice begins shouting excitedly. ) What's the matter with you?""Speaker 2: Well, That happens. I hope she is all right.""Speaker 1: But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department. It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday.""Speaker 2: That is the down side of an office romance. I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress. The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case.""Speaker 2: Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy. She is always making us kids eat the proper foods.""Speaker 1: Well, It pays off for her. How old is she anyway?""Speaker 2: She will be 86 next month.""Speaker 2: Have you graduated from college?""Speaker 2: Yes, Me too. I think I'Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train!""Speaker 1: Yes, My customers have started to complain too!""Speaker 2: Don't worry about it. It's not new, It already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt?""Speaker 1: No, Thank you.""Speaker 2: That's the most important thing.""Speaker 1: It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid.""Speaker 2: Forget about it.""Speaker 1: When you lent me the bike, It looked brand new, Almost anyway.""Speaker 2: Maybe, But really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.""Speaker 2: No, I don't have any hobbies. How about you?""Speaker 1: I like collecting antiques. It's expensive, But it's a lot of fun.""Speaker 2: Really? How many collections do you have?""Speaker 1: So far I have more than 500 collections.""Speaker 2: Among those collections, Which is the most expensive?""Speaker 2: A Sony. It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart.""Speaker 1: What about the quality?""Speaker 2: Well start out from Long Island this Friday. We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City, Where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday.""Speaker 1: Well, You've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then.""Speaker 2: Oh, We'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by. How does it sound, David?""Speaker 1: It sounds good. You can do a lot of sightseeing, Too.""Speaker 2: Yes, We'll take our time. And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street.""Speaker 1: So, You're going to have a really nice vacation.""Speaker 2: Six o'clock in the afternoon.""Speaker 1: For how many guests, Please?""Speaker 2: Six.""Speaker 1: How much would you like to spend?""Speaker 2: We don't care about money. We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties.""Speaker 1: Ok.""Speaker 2: How many courses are there altogether, Please?""Speaker 1: Eight.""Speaker 2: Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner?""Speaker 1: Sure. The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices.""Speaker 2: Mars. Scientists say there might be water on it.""Speaker 1: If so, We may live there someday.""Speaker 2: I hope so. Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month?""Speaker 1: Sure. I heard about this on the TV. On January 3rd, 2004, Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater. And three weeks later, Spirit's twin explorer, Opportunity, Landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists.""Speaker 2: Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge, And creativity. I love this job.""Speaker 1: I can see that. But I didn't know you had experience in that line of work.""Speaker 2: I didn't, But I applied for an apprenticeship, And since I studied math, And I have a good attitude, My application was accepted.""Speaker 2: Hey, I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got.""Speaker 1: It just happened to be the highest grade in the class.""Speaker 2: You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did. Admit it.""Speaker 1: I worked hard too. But she always gives me a lower grade.""Speaker 2: What's the problem?""Speaker 1: Two of my classes occur at the same time.""Speaker 2: Well, I can see that's a problem.""Speaker 1: Is it at all possible for you to fix that error?""Speaker 2: Yes, I can. Would you still like to have both of these classes?""Speaker 1: I want to keep both of them, If that's possible.""Speaker 2: Well, Let me find you one of these classes on a different day.""Speaker 2: Congratulations! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born?""Speaker 1: It's the tradition. But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri.""Speaker 2: In any case, I like baby showers, Because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world.""Speaker 1: So you will come, Won't you?""Speaker 2: Of course. I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival.""Speaker 2: It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off.""Speaker 1: What?""Speaker 2: The World Cup! The first match is today! It's Mexico vs. South Africa! It's going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, And all.""Speaker 1: I have no idea what you're talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.""Speaker 2: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, Man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, Each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals.""Speaker 1: Sounds interesting, But soccer doesn't really appeal to me.""Speaker 2: Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It's a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, Hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they're really good!""Speaker 1: All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down, Trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like asissy sport to me!""Speaker 2: It's a letter from NYU.""Speaker 1: Tell me what it says!""Speaker 2: I didn't get in.""Speaker 1: You're lying.""Speaker 2: I'm not lying.""Speaker 1: Are you upset?""Speaker 2: I had high hopes for NYU.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry you didn't get accepted.""Speaker 2: I am 100 % certain.""Speaker 1: According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.""Speaker 2: It's leap my mind. I really feel terrible about it.""Speaker 1: I have been looking forward to this performance all month.""Speaker 2: Oh, No. What kind of trouble?""Speaker 2: Well, To begin with, Gambling is addictive, Ruins marriages, Destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, Cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, It exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, And senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.""Speaker 1: Geez! Now that I think about it, Maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, And I didn't become addicted or anything like that.""Speaker 2: No. I don't think that's possible. Some places are sure to be open.""Speaker 1: But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money.""Speaker 2: Mmm, You may be right.""Speaker 1: Do you think we'll need our overcoats?""Speaker 2: No. We couldn't possibly.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: It will be summer. So it will be hot.""Speaker 1: Is that very likely in England?""Speaker 2: I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap.""Speaker 1: I know what you mean.""Speaker 2: I want to give a gift that is really meaningful.""Speaker 1: Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them.""Speaker 2: Mine are, Too.""Speaker 1: So maybe we shouldn't go out after all.""Speaker 2: Uh, A... You know I'm friends with William.""Speaker 2: That will work.""Speaker 1: Does five thirty work for you?""Speaker 2: That will be fine. What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time.""Speaker 1: Is it the plans for my new house?""Speaker 2: Sounds good. The food there is fantastic too.""Speaker 1: I agree, I had lunch there last week.""Speaker 2: You big scrooge!""Speaker 1: Hear me out. We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it!""Speaker 2: But you may have some trouble convincing the kids.""Speaker 1: Actual 1y, It was their idea first.""Speaker 2: He really knew his stuff, But he graded hard. Would that be OK?""Speaker 1: Yes, I really need someone who is really good.""Speaker 2: I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you do that?""Speaker 1: Maybe, But I'm not sure.""Speaker 2: Man, This guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, Don't you?""Speaker 1: No, That stuff isn't important to me.""Speaker 2: Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?""Speaker 1: I don't care about any of that.""Speaker 2: Um... And what sport are we talking about here?""Speaker 1: Football of course!""Speaker 2: Oh... Football. Football is cool. I usually try to catch the World Cup finals.""Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about American football. The World Cup is soccer.""Speaker 2: Oh, I understand. I can't say I'm a big fan. I'm from China, And football doesn't have a really big following over there.""Speaker 1: So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball?""Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut. When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?""Speaker 1: Oh, Certainly. I wouldn't miss a game for the world. My girlfriend says I have an addiction. And actually, If I had to choose between her and my games... I'd probably pick football.""Speaker 2: It seems Americans are very passionate about sports. Is this just a part of your culture?""Speaker 2: Me, Too. I'm always in low spirits when it rains. Are you going out tomorrow?""Speaker 1: Yes. I have to drive to WashingtonD. C.""Speaker 2: What bad luck!""Speaker 1: Yeah! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct. Maybe tomorrow is a clear day. Who knows?""Speaker 2: I'll bet you were a little embarrassed.""Speaker 1: You're right. The invitation said two to seven. I was there at two o'clock, But most people didn't arrive until three or four. They didn't start cooking until five o 'clock.""Speaker 2: Cookouts often start slowly. A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two.""Speaker 1: Thanks for telling me this.""Speaker 2: I was late getting back from the mall, But I'm hurrying.""Speaker 1: Why are you in such a hurry? They said, Dinner at eight, And it's only seven-fifteen. I don't want to be the first one there again.""Speaker 2: Short messages will be kept in the short messages center. Once they open the handsets they will receive them, Which is better than you can't find them.""Speaker 1: Why haven't I thought of this skill?""Speaker 2: I use short messages quite a lot. If it's not too complicated I will send a short message, Which can save much phone charge.""Speaker 1: I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call, And only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year, Didn't it?""Speaker 2: Yes. I've been to New York. I got back only yesterday.""Speaker 1: Did you enjoy yourself?""Speaker 2: Very much. New York is such a nice place. Shall I show you some photographs?""Speaker 1: Thanks, I like looking at photographs. How nice! Oh, I'm afraid I must be going now. I've got an appointment. Have a good day.""Speaker 2: You too. I hope to see you soon. Goodbye.""Speaker 2: How did you know that?""Speaker 2: How's the weather there today?""Speaker 1: It's really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed early.""Speaker 2: What's the temperature?""Speaker 1: It's 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning.""Speaker 2: Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?""Speaker 1: I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow.""Speaker 2: I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.""Speaker 1: Me too. How's the weather where you are?""Speaker 2: Nothing much. What about you? Is everything going well?""Speaker 1: Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii.""Speaker 2: How was it?""Speaker 1: I had a good time. You seem to be in a hurry. Don't let me hold you up.""Speaker 2: Sorry, I've got a meeting in half an hour.""Speaker 1: Ok, I won't keep you then.""Speaker 2: Great! It's good to see you. Goodbye!""Speaker 1: Yes, Stay in touch. Bye!""Speaker 2: Give me your email, Would you?""Speaker 2: Really? I can't believe it. It's like a dream come true. I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize!""Speaker 1: You did a good job. I'm extremely proud of you.""Speaker 2: Thanks for the compliment.""Speaker 2: I was. It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to home because I can't afford the airfare. I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, Like my mom's cooking and being around my family.""Speaker 1: Yeah, It can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, But then I started going out, Keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.""Speaker 2: I see what you mean, But I'm still bummed out.""Speaker 1: Ok. How does this sound, Let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there!""Speaker 2: You know, I could really go for that. You don't mind being my wingman for tonight?""Speaker 1: Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys 'night out... Well kinda...""Speaker 2: How about the passengers?""Speaker 2: Well, I know a lot of people have guns there. I think maybe it isn't too safe.""Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. Your sister lives there. She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go. It's true there are some dangerous places in big American cities. But if your sister lives there, She must know the city pretty well already.""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm not really scared. Maybe only a little.""Speaker 1: Don't believe what you see on TV. You will have a good time in New York. What things do you want to see?""Speaker 2: I want to see the museums, And I want to shop a lot.""Speaker 1: The museums are excellent. And the shopping! Well! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there.""Speaker 2: There is a square in front of us. We can park the car there.""Speaker 1: Is a shop there?""Speaker 2: University? Why? You asked me last year.""Speaker 1: Oh, I forget. Sorry.""Speaker 2: I went to Harvard University.""Speaker 1: Did you? And what course did you take there?""Speaker 2: God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you?""Speaker 1: I've not known. Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.""Speaker 2: I did a B. A. In economics. Remember?""Speaker 2: I washed my car instead.""Speaker 1: Ahh. And how about on Sunday? Did you watch the football?""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 1: I wasn't feeling well.""Speaker 2: Here they are.""Speaker 1: Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes?""Speaker 2: Oh, No, This is the rest.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: That's exactly why my business is doing so well!""Speaker 1: How Ay clients do you have already?""Speaker 2: Well, I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients.""Speaker 1: Wow. Too bad I don't have a clue about housework.""Speaker 2: Does it have questions about foreign language films? There's hardly any American films worth watching.""Speaker 2: Thanks. But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set.""Speaker 1: Can I help you in anyway?""Speaker 2: You can take me to the bank if you want to.""Speaker 2: We're going to do something about it.""Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.""Speaker 2: We can't put up with it any more.""Speaker 1: We'll play the CD loud, Is that all right?""Speaker 2: I don't think so.""Speaker 1: What should we do?""Speaker 2: Why don't we call them?""Speaker 2: Not at all. It's a piece of cake.""Speaker 1: A piece of cake?""Speaker 2: I thought you were good at the high jump!""Speaker 1: No, I was good at the long jump. I liked the sprints best.""Speaker 2: Did you ever win any competitions?""Speaker 1: I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters. I usually did well in thedong jump competitions, But I couldn't compete with kids from other schools in the javelin. How about you?""Speaker 2: I came second and third a few times in the regional championships, But I never won. Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events?""Speaker 2: 7:00 in my staying hotel.""Speaker 2: The government will never fulfill their promise.""Speaker 2: Does he even know how to speak English?""Speaker 1: No. But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there.""Speaker 2: That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me.""Speaker 1: Come on. You're great at teaching and I know you will love him. He's adorable!""Speaker 2: Well, The salary is a little low, But the students are nice. How are things with you?""Speaker 1: Not bad. You know I'm an air traffic controller now.""Speaker 2: Now that's an exciting job!!!""Speaker 2: It's great. Although his father didn't agree with that, Tom went through with it.""Speaker 2: Ok. How much do you want to bet on this game?""Speaker 2: They look all right to me.""Speaker 1: They're not all right. They're uncomfortable and they look terrible.""Speaker 2: It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, But there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening.""Speaker 1: Like what?""Speaker 2: Well, We can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.""Speaker 1: What else can we do to protect the environment?""Speaker 2: If you do have to drive, You should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. Also, Your home should use sources of renewable energy.""Speaker 1: How about recycling? Does that actually help?""Speaker 2: Yes. You should take your glass, Paper, Plastic, Cardboard, And tin cans to a recycling center.""Speaker 1: What do you think is the biggest worry for our future?""Speaker 2: I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone.""Speaker 1: I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before!""Speaker 2: So nice to meet you, David. Call me Bill. It's very nice of you to come here.""Speaker 2: Of course. There you are.""Speaker 2: Not really. Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN.""Speaker 1: So I take it you're pretty bored too.""Speaker 2: Just killing time until I find something to do. What are you going to do?""Speaker 1: It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing. What's wrong with us?""Speaker 2: You wanna shoot some hoops?""Speaker 1: I already tried to call up some of the guys, But they are all busy.""Speaker 2: Where's your girlfriend? I thought you were going out with her today.""Speaker 1: She's out shopping with her friends.""Speaker 2: Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then.""Speaker 1: Aright. Do you have any cigarettes?""Speaker 2: I only have a couple left. Why don't you pick some up on the way.""Speaker 1: Ok. See you there in about 30 minutes.""Speaker 2: The food station was as crowded as usual. I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich, And when I finally got it the chicken was underdone.""Speaker 1: I see. You simply can't blame the server for this.""Speaker 2: Yes, I know. Fast food is so popular in this district.""Speaker 1: That's true.""Speaker 2: Anyway, How was your such, Catherine?""Speaker 1: It was good. I brough lunch from home today.""Speaker 2: You did? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America.""Speaker 1: Well, I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy.""Speaker 2: I guess you're right. More often than not, People go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, But generally speaking, They are high in calories, Salt and fat.""Speaker 1: Yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle, Don't you?""Speaker 2: You bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America.""Speaker 1: Well, Actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places.""Speaker 2: Seriously?""Speaker 2: I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again.""Speaker 1: I understand that. But I think maybe it's not a date. You are taking the matter too much to heart.""Speaker 2: The second driver was luckier. He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound.""Speaker 1: Yes. He was released from hospital yesterday evening. The other man could be there for weeks.""Speaker 2: I understand that he's connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus. His condition can't be very good.""Speaker 1: The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable. What does that mean?""Speaker 2: It means he's really badly injured, But he will almost certainly survive.""Speaker 2: My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting. What about you?""Speaker 2: Well, I know how to turn it off!""Speaker 2: How about tomorrow instead.""Speaker 1: Hmm, That's all right. Shall we meet at the bar near the beach?""Speaker 2: I don't have an aspirin. Perhaps you should go to a doctor.""Speaker 1: No, No. I am okay. It's the weather. It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining.""Speaker 2: Really, John. I still think you should go to a doctor. You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning. Why don't you take this afternoon off? If you don't want to see a doctor, At least you can go home and have a good rest.""Speaker 1: I can't. I am already behind the schedule. Besides, You know Mr. White. He would think that I was putting him on.""Speaker 2: You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning, And you can't do anything this afternoon like this. Gee! You've got a fever.""Speaker 1: Do I? Oh, No.""Speaker 2: Listen to me. You go home now. I will call my doctor and have him go over. Ok?""Speaker 1: What about Mr. White?""Speaker 2: I'll handle him. Now go home. I'll call you after work.""Speaker 2: Join us, Will you?""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: Because of the low salaries.""Speaker 2: But your company is huge. Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages?""Speaker 1: I don't know why.""Speaker 2: Why don't you give them a suggestion?""Speaker 2: No, Thanks.""Speaker 1: Well, I hope you'll feel better soon.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Well, Times change. Look at you-you're a father now. You can't say that you haven't changed.""Speaker 1: True, But I still have to watch my baseball. The season's in full swing now.""Speaker 2: I mean, I know spring training's over, But I'm just not into all that.""Speaker 2: I guess that's just the luck of the draw.""Speaker 1: I want a rematch. Let's play again.""Speaker 2: Well, Maybe just a little. I can't seem to make it fit.""Speaker 1: I swear, The overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller!""Speaker 2: That's so true. Thanks for your help. Are you in the aisle seat in this row?""Speaker 1: Yes. What about you?""Speaker 2: I'm in the middle seat.""Speaker 1: Oh, I guess I'll let you through then.""Speaker 2: Thanks. Sorry for making you get out of your seat again.""Speaker 1: That's alright. I notice you have a few newspapers there. Would you mind lending me one?""Speaker 2: No, Not at all. Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian?""Speaker 1: I prefer the British paper, But I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away.""Speaker 2: I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off, So the Guardian is all yours.""Speaker 1: Thanks a lot. That's really nice of you. Would you like a piece of gum?""Speaker 2: Well, Uh... I didn't catch the last part.""Speaker 2: What are you talking about? It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family!""Speaker 1: I know. I know!""Speaker 2: Let's think this through. First of all, You cannot leave Amy at the altar. Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, But she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this? Second of all, You are just getting cold feet. You know deep down inside that you want to marry her, So cut the crap and do it!""Speaker 1: You're right. I'm being crazy! Ok, I'm ready, Let's do this!""Speaker 2: It is a long story. Basically, She thought I had laughed at her while I didn't.""Speaker 1: I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?""Speaker 2: She's very nice.""Speaker 1: What does she teach?""Speaker 2: English, Of course.""Speaker 1: Is she your teacher?""Speaker 2: Yes. She teaches our class three times a week.""Speaker 1: Can she speak Chinese to her students?""Speaker 2: Not very much.""Speaker 2: There's nothing to watch right now.""Speaker 1: I know. I was watching are-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored.""Speaker 2: Me too. Let's get together and do something.""Speaker 1: I'd like to, But I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow?""Speaker 2: Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow?""Speaker 2: I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny.""Speaker 1: That's great. We can do something outdoors then.""Speaker 2: Are there any special events going on tomorrow?""Speaker 1: Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow.""Speaker 2: Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out.""Speaker 1: Do you know what time it starts?""Speaker 2: It starts at one PM.""Speaker 1: Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards, We can head over there.""Speaker 2: Yes. I heard about that. And I know you want to buy it, But I'm not interested in detective novels.""Speaker 1: So what are you interested in?""Speaker 2: Magazines about fashions, Such as Cosmo Polian.""Speaker 1: I know that magazine. It's very popular.""Speaker 2: Yes. I can lend you some.""Speaker 2: That sounds fine.""Speaker 1: Good. Shall we say seven o'clock?""Speaker 2: I'll be there. You're still a fabulous cook, Aren't you?""Speaker 1: That'll be for you to decide. I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you.""Speaker 2: Oh, Do you know why? Actually, It's easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, Is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive!""Speaker 1: Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you.""Speaker 2: Yeah, They are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It's difficult and boring.""Speaker 1: It's true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. Once a week.""Speaker 2: But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don't students want to have a good memory?""Speaker 1: Of course. I didn't know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?""Speaker 2: Well, Do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, Doing aerobics, Going bicycling, And playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first.""Speaker 2: Yeah, It is my favorite. Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game. I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian, The Chinese players in NBA.""Speaker 1: What kind of sport do you like to participate in?""Speaker 2: I am good at tennis and skiing. What about you?""Speaker 1: I prefer the indoor sports, Such as bowling, Badminton and squash.""Speaker 2: Moderate exercise is really important for health. 'Life lies in movement.'.""Speaker 1: How about playing tennis with me?""Speaker 2: Welcome. My name is Johnson.""Speaker 1: Nice to meet you.""Speaker 2: Do you have any experience using weights?""Speaker 1: No, I don't. So I need some help.""Speaker 2: Well, First it is important to go through a good stretch. You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines.""Speaker 1: Yes, I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room. So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines.""Speaker 2: Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you.""Speaker 1: What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one.""Speaker 2: No. Not that. I mean a training card. The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine. Here, Let me show you.""Speaker 1: I'm ready.""Speaker 2: Now, You can see that on this card there are all the machines listed. So, When you go through the series of twelve machines, You enter in the number of repetitions you do. And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine.""Speaker 1: I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress.""Speaker 2: Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine. Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them. And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you.""Speaker 1: Alright. Great.""Speaker 2: So you write your name and member number at the top of the card. And then, After you exercise each time, You file the card here.""Speaker 1: Great. Why don't we start on the machines?""Speaker 2: Are you alright? Can you do more?""Speaker 1: I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted.""Speaker 2: That's okay. Don't worry. It's important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning.""Speaker 1: What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines.""Speaker 2: We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really. The most important thing is to know your limits. So if you feel burned out now, It is good to stop. Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, Then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right?""Speaker 2: I guess you could say that. What kind of games do you like?""Speaker 1: I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at!""Speaker 2: Doesn't everyone? Which games are those?""Speaker 1: Well, I like to play darts. Whenever I go to a bar, I usually play for a few hours.""Speaker 2: Did you play a lot of games when you were little?""Speaker 1: My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes. We used to have family tournaments every weekend.""Speaker 2: Do you still like playing those games?""Speaker 1: Not at all. I never really did, To be honest. What about you? Did your family used to play games together?""Speaker 2: Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games.""Speaker 1: Some of my friends play cards on the internet. Have you ever tried that?""Speaker 2: No, I prefer to play with people I know.""Speaker 1: How about mah-jong?""Speaker 2: It's a popular game with some people, But I've never played it.""Speaker 1: I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong!""Speaker 2: You means she didn't marry a rich man.""Speaker 1: He's a postman.""Speaker 2: Very well too, Thank you very much. Isn't it a lovely day?""Speaker 1: Yes, It's beautiful, But it's also very hot.""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: What's the weather like in your country?""Speaker 2: Mm... It's quite warm now.""Speaker 1: Where do you live?""Speaker 2: In London. Where do you live?""Speaker 2: I couldn't agree with you more.""Speaker 1: We should come here more often.""Speaker 2: You are absolutely right.""Speaker 1: I'd like to come back next weekend.""Speaker 2: Yes, It must be used for grinding coffee beans.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry. That's too bad. Who is it? Who got the job, I mean?""Speaker 1: Someone calledDrexler. CarlDrexler. He's been with the company onlytwo years. I've been here longer. And I know more about the job, Too.""Speaker 2: Hmm. Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you?""Speaker 1: Because I'm the wrong sex, Of course!""Speaker 2: You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman?""Speaker 1: Yes, That was probably it! It isn't fair.""Speaker 2: What sort of clothes does he wear?""Speaker 1: A dark suit. White shirt. A tie. Why?""Speaker 2: Perhaps that had something to do with it.""Speaker 1: You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater?""Speaker 2: It's possible, Isn't it?""Speaker 1: Do you really think I should wear different clothes?""Speaker 2: Well... Perhaps you should think about it.""Speaker 1: Why should I wear a skirt? Or a dress?""Speaker 2: I'm not saying you should. I'm saying you should think about it. That's all!""Speaker 1: Why should I do that? I'm good at my job! That's the only important thing!""Speaker 2: Are you American?""Speaker 1: No, I'm a Britisher. Where do you come from?""Speaker 2: I come from America. Are you a freshman?""Speaker 1: Yes. What about you?""Speaker 2: Me, Too.""Speaker 1: Great. Maybe we can study and play games together. I think we can be good friends.""Speaker 2: Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball?""Speaker 1: The problem is you are too nervous. You want to have a strike so much, So you deliver the ball too hard. And when it comes to the I second roll, There's no pressure. That's why you could bowl all those spares.""Speaker 2: Congratulations!""Speaker 2: What about the next day?""Speaker 1: No. I'm busy then too. I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road. Are you free on Thursday afternoon?""Speaker 2: Yes, I think I am. Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant.""Speaker 1: Good idea! Is two o'clock okay?""Speaker 2: School. Since I was working part time, I had a difficult time keeping up with class. Now that we have exams coming up, I'm totally freaking out.""Speaker 1: The best thing to do is study as much as you can. I'm sure you'll do alright.""Speaker 2: I hope so. I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days. That's what it'll take.""Speaker 1: I have to study for an exam too. Why don't we study together. We can encourage each other.""Speaker 2: What changes were made from the old page to the new page?""Speaker 1: First, The visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information. They can sign up for a free monthly drawing. Once we've got their info, It goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting. Also, There are clear links to descriptions of our products and services, So as to give confidence to new customers. We also added a specific area for on-line customer service... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback...""Speaker 2: Yeah, I think the food is alright, It's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me. But you are Chinese, You should have known better.""Speaker 1: Well, Not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people fromSichuan and Guizhou provinces can. Back where I come from, People don't eat a lot of papers and chilies.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed inSichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while though, I got used to the taste, And now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy.""Speaker 1: Yeah, You can increase you tolerance for spicy food, But so far, I haven't had the need or the opportunity. Every time I try spicy food, It is a total disaster for my nose and eyes.""Speaker 2: I completely understand. I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either, But when you have no other choices, You've got to adapt.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's a typical example of 'when in Rome, Do as the Romans do.'.""Speaker 2: Thankful, No. I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career. I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor. After a couple weeks, It was like nothing happened.""Speaker 1: It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work. Supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them.""Speaker 2: You're right, But you know, It's hard to give up an old habit.""Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.""Speaker 2: You know, I often have to work till late at night. I need something to keep me awake.""Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.""Speaker 2: Well, We went bungee jumping when we were in Australia.""Speaker 1: Wow! Isn't that dangerous?""Speaker 2: A little, But the rush was worth it.""Speaker 1: Tell me about it.""Speaker 2: We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us.""Speaker 1: 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.""Speaker 2: It's really cold. It snowed all day and the school closed early.""Speaker 1: What's the temperature?""Speaker 2: It's 20 degrees below zero now. It was even colder this morning.""Speaker 1: Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?""Speaker 2: I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow.""Speaker 1: I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.""Speaker 2: Me too. How's the weather where you are?""Speaker 2: I can tell you worked hard on it.""Speaker 1: I really did! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago.""Speaker 2: Well, It was definitely worth all the time.""Speaker 2: It is? Oh, That's nice.""Speaker 1: Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited?""Speaker 2: Actually, I'd forgotten about it.""Speaker 1: Forgotten about it? How could you?""Speaker 2: Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish.""Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.""Speaker 2: It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian.""Speaker 1: I guess so. So what do you do around this time of year?""Speaker 2: Well, I'll celebrate Hanukah soon, But that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you. Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break.""Speaker 1: Well, Would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house?""Speaker 2: May I have a look at your costume?""Speaker 1: Sure. Wait a moment. ( Several minutes later ) Here you are.""Speaker 2: I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool.""Speaker 1: I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight. Maybe I will suck their blood.""Speaker 2: Some friends of my parents live out there, And they invited me there.""Speaker 1: So, What did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, Obviously.""Speaker 2: I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't get through a whole game before I had to sit down.""Speaker 1: Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming?""Speaker 2: I wanted to, But the water is too cold, And I just wetted in up to my knees.""Speaker 1: It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that.""Speaker 2: The heart!""Speaker 1: Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, Using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins. Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive! Now what about the organs that help us digest food?""Speaker 2: The stomach and intestines!""Speaker 1: Very good! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste. Are we forgetting anything?""Speaker 2: Yeah! Our kidneys, Liver and bladder!""Speaker 1: Oh yes, You are right. Very important organs indeed.""Speaker 2: So what do these organs do, Teacher?""Speaker 2: I just opened up my own business not long ago.""Speaker 1: Good for you! What are you doing?""Speaker 2: I'm a professional party planner here in the city. I do catering and all that.""Speaker 1: I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun!""Speaker 2: Yes. You know I'Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients.""Speaker 1: Did you buy new cupboards too?""Speaker 2: No, I didn't. I gave them a really good clean, So they just look new. The worktop was in poor condition, So I had a new one added.""Speaker 1: I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils.""Speaker 2: Yes, I have. I need them to help me with these new dished I'm trying to make. I need a little more practice before I invite guests over.""Speaker 1: Looking at the spice rack, I'd say you'Ve been learning how to make asian food.""Speaker 2: Yes. I'Ve always likes Indian and thai food, So I'Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries. I'm pretty good at making curries now, But I still need practice at making thai food.""Speaker 1: Both kinds of food are becoming popular. Nowadays, It's very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket.""Speaker 2: No, Quite the opposite. I thought I'd never stop falling down. Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better.""Speaker 1: I see. Do you ski often?""Speaker 2: Every chance I get. On weekends I ski all day long. Sometimes I even ski at night.""Speaker 1: That sounds great.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. The ski slopes are well lit. It's really nice to ski at night. Why don't you learn to ski?""Speaker 1: Not on your life! I know I'd break my leg.""Speaker 2: Yeah? Which one was that?""Speaker 1: The one that said, You're a creep. From me you won't hear another peep. I hope you wreck your jeep.""Speaker 2: I see. Would you like me to reschedule you for another night?""Speaker 1: Ok, We will let you know as early as possible. By the way, Will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation?""Speaker 2: Certainly.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: That's all right. I hope we can help you at some other time. Good-bye.""Speaker 2: Yes, It is. You want go online? There are no wi-fi hotspots around.""Speaker 1: Oh my, No internet access is killing me.""Speaker 2: Can't you wait till you get home? Then you can surf the internet using the broadband, Wireless connection or whatever you like.""Speaker 1: No, I'm not feeling myself. I just want to check my emails, Visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends.""Speaker 2: Now I see, You must be suffering from discomgoogolation.""Speaker 1: What does that mean? There's nothing wrong with me.""Speaker 2: Well, The term 'discomgoogolation' comes from 'discombobulate' and 'google'. Because floods of information are just a mouse click away, Net users are very likely to become addicted to the web.""Speaker 1: That's alright. I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information. It almost drives me crazy.""Speaker 2: I suppose you're right, Lee. Maybe that's why so many Westerners are overweight.""Speaker 1: It's interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, Do not take naps during the day, And yet they can be so heavy.""Speaker 2: Oh, It's fantastic.""Speaker 1: Where did you go?""Speaker 2: On my first trip I went to Tokyo, And on my second trip I visited Kyoto.""Speaker 1: What did you think of Tokyo?""Speaker 2: Very big and exciting, But very crowded, Too.""Speaker 1: Yeah. I've seen pictures of the crowds!""Speaker 2: And the restaurant are excellent... But they're kind of expensive.""Speaker 1: And how about Kyoto?""Speaker 2: Kyoto is lovely. It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens. It's a very historic city.""Speaker 1: How was the weather?""Speaker 2: I was in Tokyo in August, And it was really hot and humid. I went to Kyoto in October. It was hot and sunny, But there was no humidity.""Speaker 2: Thanks.""Speaker 1: Here you are. You must return them within a month.""Speaker 2: What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month?""Speaker 1: You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them.""Speaker 2: Ok. Thank you very much for your trouble.""Speaker 2: I have no plans for Friday, So curry would be great. Which restaurant do you have in mind?""Speaker 1: Susan suggested the one on Main Street. She says it is very good.""Speaker 2: Which one is that?""Speaker 1: You know, The one just on the corner with Oxford Street. There is a large pharmacy next door.""Speaker 2: Oh yes, I know which one you mean. I have never been there, But I looked at their menu once and it did look good.""Speaker 1: Okay then. I think we will all meet outside?""Speaker 2: What time?""Speaker 1: At 8 o'clock. I will make the reservation.""Speaker 2: What was that like?""Speaker 1: It was always very busy there.""Speaker 2: What did you do?""Speaker 1: I stood behind the register and took pizza orders.""Speaker 2: Did you get any perks on the job?""Speaker 2: Sure. But you can only keep them for a week.""Speaker 2: Yeah, But that's not why I am upset. I just found out another guy got a promotion. He doesn't know how to do anything. He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long.""Speaker 1: That sucks.""Speaker 2: I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies.""Speaker 1: Look on the bright side. At least you have a job.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I shouldn't stress about this anymore. It's not like I can do anything about it.""Speaker 1: Exactly. Instead, We should have some drinks tonight.""Speaker 2: How about a cold bottle of beer.""Speaker 2: So it's not as convenient for left-handed people?""Speaker 1: It's better for right-handed people like me. See, I don't even have to move my arm to see the time.""Speaker 2: I'm left-handed. You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it...""Speaker 2: Sorry, Sir. The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st.""Speaker 2: It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.""Speaker 1: And how long does the course last?""Speaker 2: It lasts for 9 months.""Speaker 1: When does it start?""Speaker 2: The next beginning class starts on October 25th.""Speaker 1: What time is the class?""Speaker 2: From 7 to 9 o'clock.""Speaker 1: How much does it cost?""Speaker 2: It costs 125 dollars a month.""Speaker 1: Yes, That's all right. I want to enroll in the course.""Speaker 2: Thank you, Please fill out this form for us.""Speaker 1: Do you want me to fill it out now?""Speaker 2: I'm majoring in French literature.""Speaker 1: Oh, Don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long.""Speaker 2: That's right. We got the assignment last week.""Speaker 1: When is it due?""Speaker 2: Next Monday!""Speaker 2: If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure!""Speaker 1: My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!""Speaker 2: Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married?""Speaker 2: It won't start.""Speaker 1: Do you want me to take a look?""Speaker 2: No, Thank you. I think I can handle it.""Speaker 1: Well, If you change your mind, Let me know.""Speaker 2: I will. Thanks. That's sweet of you.""Speaker 1: No problem.""Speaker 2: I might need some tools though. Do you know where I can get some?""Speaker 1: Sure. I have all kinds of tools. Just ask. I'll be happy to get them for you.""Speaker 2: Thanks. That would be very helpful.""Speaker 1: Anything for you. Seriously, I don't mind helping.""Speaker 2: They use said it.""Speaker 1: This city is really comfortable to living.""Speaker 2: It sure is.""Speaker 1: No other city can match it. It's heaven.""Speaker 2: Well, If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much.""Speaker 1: Maybe.""Speaker 2: It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own.""Speaker 1: They see their independence as a kind of character strength.""Speaker 2: What a lovely dog! How did you know I love this?""Speaker 1: I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.""Speaker 2: Maybe you don't believe it, But it was made by my grandmother.""Speaker 1: Really? It looks so nice.""Speaker 2: Thank you. Please have a cup of tea.""Speaker 1: All right.""Speaker 2: How about some fish?""Speaker 1: No, Thanks. I've had enough. Now, Mary, Before you blow out the birthday candles, You have to make a wish. After that, You may cut the cake.""Speaker 2: Ok, Let me make a wish... Do you want a big piece of cake?""Speaker 1: No, Just a small one. Next let's sing 'Happy Birthday' to Mary.""Speaker 2: About a year ago, He started feeling weak all the time.""Speaker 1: Is it due to old age or is he sick.""Speaker 2: Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth.""Speaker 1: That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life.""Speaker 2: That's what my father tells me almost everyday.""Speaker 1: Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me.""Speaker 2: Jen, Is there someone you're not telling me about?""Speaker 1: No. I just like looking at wedding rings, Ok?""Speaker 2: Women are such dreamers.""Speaker 2: Geez! What's the rush?""Speaker 1: Don't worry about it, Just drive. Oh, No, The light is about to change... Step on it!""Speaker 2: Are you nuts! I'm not going to run a red light!""Speaker 1: Whatever. Just turn right here.... The freeway will be packed at this hour.... Let's take a side street. Go on! Get out of our way! Move, Move!""Speaker 2: What's your problem! Geez. Having a fit is not going to help!""Speaker 1: Here, I know a short cut... Just go down here, And we'll cut though Ashburn Heights. Let's go, Let's go! Watch out for that lady!""Speaker 2: I'm going as fast as I can!""Speaker 1: Yes! We made it. 5:58, Just before the library closes.""Speaker 2: Well, It's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands. France isn't an island, Is it?""Speaker 1: Oh, No, France isn't an island. It is located in the western part of the European continent. But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts. Does Japan have good harbors?""Speaker 2: Good harbors! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world, And Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world. Also, There are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands. France isn't very mountainous, Is it?""Speaker 1: No, France isn't very mountainous. But it does contain the Pyrenees, A large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons. What kind of Climate does Japan have?""Speaker 2: The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south, Mild in the central part and cold in the north. Except for Hokkaido, We don't get much snowfall at all. France has a mild climate, Doesn't it?""Speaker 1: Yes, The climate of France rarely has severe winters. In southern France, One can live in comfort the whole year. Is Japan good for farming?""Speaker 2: Yes, Japan is good for farming. Rice is the main crop, But Japan is also an industrial center. Fishing is very important, Too. Rice isn't grown in France, Is it?""Speaker 1: No, Rice isn't grown in France. But farming, Fishing and industry are also very important in France. I'd like to go to Japan some day. Would you like to visit France?""Speaker 2: It is a long story. Basically, She thought I had laughed at her while I didn't.""Speaker 1: I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?""Speaker 2: Since we're late, Let's go to see a film.""Speaker 2: Well. I think IQ matters more. But it won't work without EQ.""Speaker 1: Why? You seem pretty sure about it.""Speaker 2: Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life.""Speaker 1: But IQ is decided at birth. One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it.""Speaker 2: That's why people's achievement varies greatly.""Speaker 1: That's true, But what if one comes across some difficulties. He must rely on his EQ to deal with them.""Speaker 2: Yes, Jerry, Can you share your understanding of EQ?""Speaker 1: I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives.""Speaker 2: Quite right. Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success?""Speaker 1: Just as Forrest?""Speaker 2: Yes, His IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ.""Speaker 2: That won't take long.""Speaker 1: Well, It won't if there no line at the pump.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm not quite ready.""Speaker 1: I'll give you five more minutes, Then I'm going on without you!""Speaker 2: You wouldn't do a thing like that!""Speaker 2: I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, But you're always so negative.""Speaker 1: I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.""Speaker 2: You see, That's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.""Speaker 1: Next time, Go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.""Speaker 2: Well he's more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories.""Speaker 1: Love stories? More like one-night-stands.""Speaker 2: Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, Drunk friends of yours ; they're no saints.""Speaker 1: My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?""Speaker 2: How do you find studying a language on the internet?""Speaker 1: It's not easy, Particularly with listening and speaking, Because sometimes the connection isn't too good.""Speaker 2: I bet you find the character difficult to write!""Speaker 1: Actually, Many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, So they're easy for me.""Speaker 2: So, You can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, Right?""Speaker 1: Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?""Speaker 2: Didn't I?""Speaker 1: You know you didn't.""Speaker 2: Well, I am telling you now.""Speaker 1: Yes, But you might have told me before.""Speaker 2: I didn't think you would be interested.""Speaker 1: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her?""Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.""Speaker 2: Richard did, But I didn't. Of course, I told him I liked it.""Speaker 1: Yeah. So did you do anything else?""Speaker 2: Well, We went to a dance club.""Speaker 1: Did you have fun there?""Speaker 2: Well, I think so. But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree. If can get a Ph.D. Abroad, It will be much easy for me to get a job at home.""Speaker 1: How can you finance your education abroad? It is very expensive to study abroad.""Speaker 2: I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad. Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams. If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough, I may get a scholarship.""Speaker 2: How much is the ticket?""Speaker 2: I couldn't agree with you more.""Speaker 1: We should come here more often.""Speaker 2: You are absolutely right.""Speaker 2: Could I get back the sweater you borrowed?""Speaker 1: Sure. Oh, That reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?""Speaker 2: They should. This holiday is about remembering our war dead. But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts!""Speaker 2: I really love their dancing. They are all excellent dancers.""Speaker 1: The lyrics of the new song are beautiful, Too. Can you sing?""Speaker 2: Sure. I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now.""Speaker 1: Let's go buy their new album. Want to come with me?""Speaker 2: I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me.""Speaker 1: Is there a good time for you to help me?""Speaker 2: If we work on this tomorrow night, You could easily be ready by Friday.""Speaker 1: How about meeting in my office?""Speaker 2: That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have.""Speaker 1: Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot.""Speaker 2: I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex.""Speaker 1: Oh, How did you deal with it?""Speaker 2: I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's a pity. What was the matter?""Speaker 2: Simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.""Speaker 1: Like what?""Speaker 2: He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. In their culture women should put family first.""Speaker 2: Yes, He said it would be better for me and for the whole family. But I simply can not quit working.""Speaker 1: So that's why it's hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner.""Speaker 2: He ran four miles and came back dead beat.""Speaker 2: And you're planning to enter?""Speaker 1: Of course. This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice.""Speaker 2: Is there a prize?""Speaker 1: I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio.""Speaker 2: Do you think you have a chance?""Speaker 1: A chance? Not just a chance, I'm a hundred percent certain. Everyone says my voice is beautiful.""Speaker 2: But you haven't practised all that much.""Speaker 1: I still have 5 days to practise. It's in the bag!""Speaker 2: Don't be too sure. You're still going to need some help.""Speaker 2: Ok, I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch. It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time. I am sure they don't want to miss it.""Speaker 2: Today is May first, 2003.""Speaker 1: Oh, Today's International Labour Day. Is it our working day?""Speaker 2: Great.""Speaker 1: And don't forget your fishing tackle.""Speaker 2: Deal, Where is Gucci?""Speaker 1: She is the cheer-leader. They are required to put on a performance. Look! Here they come.""Speaker 2: Oh, Look at her. She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA.""Speaker 1: I want to be like her.""Speaker 2: Get real. Don't be so pathetic.""Speaker 1: Hey, Young man! I'm yoursis. Don't talk to me like that.""Speaker 2: Oh, Man, Look at her, Go! She is amazing! She should be mysis.""Speaker 1: Boy, You've got such a crush on her, Haven't you?""Speaker 2: Yes, I want to be her boyfriend. Just like in the movie.""Speaker 1: Are you out of your mind?""Speaker 2: She told me she liked my new haircut. She thought it was cool.""Speaker 2: And he's bright and intelligent. I'm sure he can pass the university entrance exam.""Speaker 1: I wish he could too.""Speaker 2: How's your boy, Jack?""Speaker 1: He's a bit tired, You know. It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up.""Speaker 2: Poor boys! They work harder at school nowadays, Don't they?""Speaker 2: Yes, It is. But you must pay a deposit for the card.""Speaker 1: There will be a refund when I return the card, Right?""Speaker 2: Yes, If the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches.""Speaker 2: Me, What brought that on?""Speaker 1: There's a story about breakdancing in the paper.""Speaker 2: What does it say?""Speaker 1: According to the story, It's some sort of modern dance style.""Speaker 2: Like disco?""Speaker 1: Well, Breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance.""Speaker 2: And disco a kind of nightclub.""Speaker 1: Right, A disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music...""Speaker 2: So... Disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it. And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether.""Speaker 2: Do you need it for the whole weekend?""Speaker 1: We will need it for both days.""Speaker 2: We will need to know who will be driving the van.""Speaker 1: The van will be driven by Mary and me.""Speaker 2: It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?""Speaker 1: Oh yeah, No problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom.""Speaker 2: The Canadian rock singer? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday. How did you see her?""Speaker 1: Yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, Her poster, A CD...""Speaker 2: So you're a big fan, Eh?""Speaker 1: Not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer, Too.""Speaker 2: And she was in a movie once again, Right?""Speaker 1: Yes, Though I don't think her acting skills are that great.""Speaker 2: What was your impression of her when you saw her in person?""Speaker 1: She looked sweeter than her pictures.""Speaker 2: Did you take a photo with her?""Speaker 1: No, There were too many people. When she got out of the car, Her fans were all screaming, Trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs.""Speaker 2: No, I think it's how you budget your life, That's the problem.""Speaker 1: That's my business, Not yours.""Speaker 2: True enough, Until the time comes that you need to take my money. I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important.""Speaker 1: So how do you survive from pay day to pay day?""Speaker 2: I don't just survive. I put money away as well. I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go, And I stick to my plan. If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises.""Speaker 1: I'm not disciplined enough I guess.""Speaker 2: If we built more roads, People would just fill them with cars again. I think we should discourage people from using their cars.""Speaker 1: How would you do that?""Speaker 2: I think we should do a few things at once. Improving public transport would encourage people to use that. If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre, They won't use their cars as much.""Speaker 1: I don't know. I think it's unfair to make drivers pay more money. They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax, For example.""Speaker 2: I think that they should pay more tax. Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people's health by discharging all those exhaust fumes.""Speaker 1: The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city. The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom. It well be unpopular.""Speaker 2: No, I transferred here.""Speaker 1: What school did you come from?""Speaker 2: I transferred from PCC.""Speaker 1: Why'd you transfer here?""Speaker 2: I wanted to attend this school originally, But my grades out of high school weren't good enough.""Speaker 1: Is PCC a good school?""Speaker 2: PCC is great!""Speaker 1: I hope you enjoy it here.""Speaker 2: She is a beautiful bride.""Speaker 1: I am so happy for them.""Speaker 2: Are you crying?""Speaker 1: Yes, I always cry at weddings.""Speaker 2: Harris and Anne are perfect for each other.""Speaker 1: Yes, They are.""Speaker 2: You and Tom also make a great couple.""Speaker 1: In fact, We are beginning to make preparations.""Speaker 2: For the wedding?""Speaker 1: No, No, For the engagement.""Speaker 2: I am not good at picking gifts. Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier?""Speaker 1: I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last.""Speaker 2: Yeah, That's nice.""Speaker 1: Hmm, I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home.""Speaker 2: A plant? That's creative. I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you. But there is a problem. Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs?""Speaker 1: I hope so. I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase. I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border.""Speaker 2: Whose house warming party is it?""Speaker 1: Tom and Bill Smith. They are both working now you know? And they've bought a new house.""Speaker 2: Oh, They have? I didn't know. I haven't seen Tom lately.""Speaker 1: It's out in the suburbs.""Speaker 2: Have you seen the house?""Speaker 1: Yes, I have. I went out with them last weekend.""Speaker 2: Is it nice?""Speaker 1: Yes, It is. There are three bedrooms, A living room, A dining room, And a big kitchen. There's also a garden.""Speaker 2: Well, That does sound nice. Have they moved in yet?""Speaker 1: They are moving today. Tom's taken the day off. He's rented a truck, And they should have all their furniture in the house tonight.""Speaker 2: When are they going to have the party?""Speaker 1: Next Saturday night. You should get your invitation today or tomorrow.""Speaker 2: I agree. As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects. That is frightening.""Speaker 1: Sure it is. Is it convenient to get there by plane?""Speaker 2: You can see many cows and horses there. Lf you are brave enough, You can try horseback riding. It is fun.""Speaker 1: Sounds very interesting. I can't wait to go there.""Speaker 2: Wow! It is huge and you can do many activities here.""Speaker 1: That is true. Some people go camping, Some people pick fresh fruit, Some people go boating and some people go grass skiing.""Speaker 2: I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm.""Speaker 1: Well, Now you know. Let's go to the lake over there. Some people are fishing over there. I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake, I really want to try.""Speaker 2: I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first.""Speaker 1: Yes. We can get what we need at the stands right by the lake. Who do you think will catch a big fish first?""Speaker 2: Of course. I will.""Speaker 1: Wait and see. I want to try horseback riding after fishing. It looks very exciting and fun.""Speaker 2: It is. However, You will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider.""Speaker 2: He was arrested by the police for drinking and driving.""Speaker 1: Was it his first offence?""Speaker 2: Unfortunately not. He was charged with a DUI when he was in university.""Speaker 1: What happened to him then?""Speaker 2: Not much ; it was a minor offence back then. He got away with a fine of $ 500.""Speaker 1: Did they take his license away?""Speaker 2: No, They were really easy on him. The problem is that that was a long time ago. They are much tougher on crime now.""Speaker 1: What do you think will happen to him?""Speaker 2: Well, He'll definitely lose his license, Pay a fine, And maybe even spend some time in jail.""Speaker 1: That doesn't sound too promising. Does he have a defence lawyer?""Speaker 2: Not yet. If we can't find a lawyer for him, Then the state will appoint him with one.""Speaker 1: My sister is a lawyer. I can ask her if she can help him.""Speaker 2: Then we return to the hotel and come back. Will you change the appointment?""Speaker 1: Certainly. What time will you come back?""Speaker 2: At seven, Please.""Speaker 1: How many in your party?""Speaker 2: A party of three.""Speaker 2: I'm not a very good singer, But I'm a really great dancer! I love hip hop dancing.""Speaker 2: I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month.""Speaker 1: What kind of volunteer work?""Speaker 2: I help out at the children's hospital. I help plan activities.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah?""Speaker 2: She kept on bothering me.""Speaker 1: She's your sister. What she asked was only duck soup for you. Why can't you be good to her?""Speaker 2: I am very sorry to hear that you'Ve been having so many problems.""Speaker 1: Sorry isn't good enough! What can you do to help me?""Speaker 2: I understand why you're angry, Mrs. Wilson, And believe me, We are doing everything in our power to work this out.""Speaker 1: Well, Obviously, What you're doing is not good enough!""Speaker 2: In your first letter, That is, When you apply for admission, You should also tell them you need their financial aid.""Speaker 1: Then...""Speaker 2: If the aid is available, They will give you two or more application forms, One is for admission, The others are for the aid.""Speaker 1: What if not?""Speaker 2: We watched lots of television and films.""Speaker 1: I see. Anything else?""Speaker 2: Yes, We ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine.""Speaker 2: The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Are you used to the climate here?""Speaker 2: I think I'll soon get used to it.""Speaker 1: What is the average temperature of Beijing?""Speaker 2: Lt's about 180C, But in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero. And we have a long winter.""Speaker 1: Which season do you like best?""Speaker 2: And you think I fit the qualifications?""Speaker 1: Yes. Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life? The job doesn't stop when we graduate.""Speaker 2: Really? What is there to do after we graduate?""Speaker 1: Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president.""Speaker 2: Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China, On which many Chinese mourn the dead.""Speaker 1: What do they do?""Speaker 2: Well... Thanks, Marcia. It's very nice of you to say so. I mean...""Speaker 1: It was that final sprint! You were great! Really!""Speaker 2: It should be, But there are too many options. My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices, But after that...""Speaker 1: I know. You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, A big school or a small school, A public or private school...""Speaker 2: Yup, You understand. And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college. They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline. And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low.""Speaker 1: I see. Well, Don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school. He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction. He gave me some information, And next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended.""Speaker 2: Public schools are usually state funded, Whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere.""Speaker 1: Which is better?""Speaker 2: One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers.""Speaker 1: I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools.""Speaker 2: Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?""Speaker 1: I've made arrangements with a friend to help me.""Speaker 2: You know that I only allow one absence per semester, Don't you?""Speaker 1: Yes, I know.""Speaker 2: Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me.""Speaker 1: Ok, I can do that.""Speaker 2: I'll tell you all about it another day.""Speaker 1: But you're OK? It was nothing serious, Was it?""Speaker 2: As much as I love this city, I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health.""Speaker 1: I know what you mean. However, There are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, Then it's the natural disasters, Deforestation, Or the greenhouse effect.""Speaker 2: What is the greenhouse effect exactly?""Speaker 1: It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature.""Speaker 2: I see, So it's similar to global warming?""Speaker 1: They're related to one another, Yes.""Speaker 2: I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.""Speaker 1: People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, But it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well.""Speaker 2: People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations.""Speaker 2: Shut up!""Speaker 1: No, Listen to me. Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well. Maybe in other people's eyes, I want you to be my girl-friend. But... But...""Speaker 2: But you have had lily already? You should have told me about her, But you didn't.""Speaker 1: Ok... Ok... Anyway. I will treat you as my best friend. I hope you can do the same.""Speaker 2: So they're easy to remember.""Speaker 1: Yeah, How about your maths teacher?""Speaker 2: He's an old antique, Very serious.""Speaker 1: Bad luck, Anne.""Speaker 2: Hey! How about your history teacher?""Speaker 1: She's another antique.""Speaker 2: You mean the one starring JohnTravolta?""Speaker 1: Yeah, That's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding.""Speaker 2: Sounds like an interesting film. Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday.""Speaker 2: All right.""Speaker 1: Are you sure? I don't want to inconvenience you.""Speaker 2: No problem. I'd be happy to.""Speaker 2: What is it?""Speaker 1: It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time.""Speaker 2: I can understand the problem with that.""Speaker 1: Is there any way that you can fix my schedule?""Speaker 2: No problem, Do you want those classes still?""Speaker 1: Yes, I do.""Speaker 2: Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.""Speaker 2: There's an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs. We have a subsidiary company l.""Speaker 1: Are the reports favorable?""Speaker 2: Generally, The reporters take positive lines. They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of, But there's nothing worrying in the reports. In the classifieds, One of our competitors is a.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. They must be thinking of moving into that market. Are there any interesting editorials?""Speaker 2: Not really. They all seem to focus on the election. There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week.""Speaker 1: I'm not surprised. That article certainly added fuel to the debate. Ok. Thanks. Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me? I'd like to read them.""Speaker 2: Oh, How were you saved finally?""Speaker 2: Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least. He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it. But if anything happens again, Then maybe you should call.""Speaker 1: Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!""Speaker 2: Of course you can call the police if you want. That's not what I mean. I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything.""Speaker 1: I suppose. What can they do? I don't even know who he is.""Speaker 2: Listen, Carol. Don't let this bother you too much. Probably it's nothing. Just keep your eyes open when you go out. If you see him a third time, And if he follows you again, Then I think we should go to the police. But for now, Just try not to worry.""Speaker 2: I enjoy the various characters and the plot.""Speaker 1: Well. I like the Thorn Birds best.""Speaker 2: Is it very interesting?""Speaker 1: Sure. I like the writer's language, Too.""Speaker 2: If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book.""Speaker 1: Would you like to go to the bookshop with me?""Speaker 2: Yes. Here you go.""Speaker 1: Apparently, You have unpaid late fees.""Speaker 2: I do?""Speaker 1: You owe some money.""Speaker 2: Exactly how much do I owe?""Speaker 1: You owe $ 24. 50.""Speaker 2: I won't be able to pay that right now.""Speaker 1: Until you pay it, You can't check out books.""Speaker 2: Ok, I will go into more detail. A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation. You can discuss with him the program selection, Changing or adding a program, The requirements for graduation, And other problems related to your study. You will choose some courses, And then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation.""Speaker 1: Everything is so new to me. I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there.""Speaker 2: Sure, Very difficult.""Speaker 1: I am very grateful for your advice.""Speaker 2: Hey! But that's not the only problem. There's also the affirmative action stigma.""Speaker 1: You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota? That's not true at all, You're really a smart guy.""Speaker 2: I know that, But some people don't think like that. And I get problems from teachers as well.""Speaker 1: Teachers? I didn't think that they would be racist at all.""Speaker 2: Racist? Not exactly. It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic, As if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject. Suddenly I become the representative of the black race, As if we all had the same opinion.""Speaker 2: What building is it in?""Speaker 1: It's in the C building.""Speaker 2: Oh, I know exactly where that is.""Speaker 1: Do you think you can tell me where it is?""Speaker 2: Sure, What room number is it?""Speaker 1: It's room number 261.""Speaker 2: I have a class around there right now.""Speaker 1: Could you show me where it is?""Speaker 2: Well, Honestly speaking, I went to watch it out of curiosity. I'd say it's really a special art form.""Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more. Actually, I'm a Beijing Opera fan.""Speaker 2: Ok!""Speaker 1: Let's see. He has a roman nose, Bushy eyebrows and dimples!""Speaker 2: Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, Sunken eyes and a mole on her chin!""Speaker 1: Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! Ok, My turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, He is also bald!""Speaker 2: Your future husband!""Speaker 2: Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food table?""Speaker 1: Julie, Do you know who that woman is over there by the window?""Speaker 2: That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee.""Speaker 1: I thought that he was with Malia.""Speaker 2: Oh, That relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday.""Speaker 1: I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!""Speaker 2: To be honest, It was horrible! My manager is such a pain in the neck!""Speaker 1: Why? What happened?""Speaker 2: Well, He made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, My manager blamed them on me!""Speaker 1: That's not very fair. What did you do?""Speaker 2: There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, He would have fired for me for sure.""Speaker 1: Does he treat everyone in your department like this?""Speaker 2: He treats everyone pretty poorly, But the way he treats me really takes the cake!""Speaker 1: Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others?""Speaker 2: I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair!""Speaker 1: Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company?""Speaker 2: Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion.""Speaker 1: That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders.""Speaker 2: I try to be sensible about it, But it's not very easy. Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it.""Speaker 2: I lived in England when I was a child.""Speaker 1: What else can you speak?""Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't quite follow you.""Speaker 1: Well, I hear David have been fired.""Speaker 2: It's idea of my husband. He is always banging the drum for better schools.""Speaker 2: That surely will cost you a lot of money. Are you going to make a full payment?""Speaker 1: Do you think I am rich enough to make it? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment, I can move in at once.""Speaker 2: Not at all.""Speaker 1: I'm most grateful. Everyone in our class enjoyed it.""Speaker 2: I'm glad.""Speaker 2: This is our courtyard.""Speaker 1: It's so spacious, About 40 square metres, Right?""Speaker 2: Yes, About 46 square metres.""Speaker 1: Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: Very beautiful and very interesting. But why do you hang them in the tree?""Speaker 2: They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them, So they hung them in the tree. Then in winter, They can peel corn ears in their leisure time.""Speaker 2: Actually it will be my first time to meet her.""Speaker 1: You mean you haven't seen her before? Then, How could she be your girlfriend? Maybe you don't even know her.""Speaker 2: That's true. But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now. Actually we are on an intimate level. We even plan to be engaged next month.""Speaker 1: Congratulations! It's good to follow your heart. But I just didn't expect to be so fast.""Speaker 2: The Internet is making interaction much faster. People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way.""Speaker 2: Ok kids, Here 'sa beach ball and a Frisbee, A pail and a shovel. I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave. Don't stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.""Speaker 1: And stay in the shallow area. I don't want to see you go any farther than that sandbar! It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floatier.""Speaker 2: You're back already? The water was too cold, Huh? I'll tell you a secret. Do you see that small pool of water over there? It'll be warmer in there. Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.""Speaker 1: What is that? A jellyfish? Jeremy, Put that down right now! It could sting you!""Speaker 2: Good.""Speaker 1: I called you yesterday. Did you get my message?""Speaker 2: Yes, I was taking a shower when you called. I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, But I think your phone was off.""Speaker 1: No problem. I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week. You're still coming to the wedding with me, Right?""Speaker 2: Oh, Is that next week?""Speaker 1: Yes. Did you forget?""Speaker 2: No, Of course not. I already bought them a present.""Speaker 1: That's good. I want to invite Megan also. Next time you see her, Can you tell her for me.""Speaker 2: Sure. Does she know your friend?""Speaker 1: Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that. I'm not exactly sure how they know each other.""Speaker 2: Are we all going to drive together?""Speaker 2: I mean that you're gullible. You shouldn't believe everything you read, Especially on the Internet.""Speaker 1: But it seems like a good idea. All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter. After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money.""Speaker 2: Sounds like a pyramid scheme. Have you heard of those before?""Speaker 1: Pyramid scheme? What is that?""Speaker 2: It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy, Like a pyramid. The person at the top asks the people below him for money, And then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him.""Speaker 1: Sounds good to me. The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him.""Speaker 2: Not exactly. The scam keeps on going, With the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom.""Speaker 1: What happens then?""Speaker 2: Nothing. The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them, And they get nothing. They end up losing. That's why it's a scam.""Speaker 2: You sure have a lot of discs here.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got everything from rock n 'roll to the latest new - wave stuff.""Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I'm strictly into classical music. You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart, Do you?""Speaker 1: Sorry, My taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960's. Music written before then is just history to me.""Speaker 2: Yes, Sunday sounds fine. What time?""Speaker 1: Does 6, 30 suit you?""Speaker 2: It suits us fine. We'll see you then.""Speaker 2: That might be a little too cold for some people.""Speaker 1: Yes, You are right.""Speaker 2: What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot.""Speaker 1: Yes, That would work out better.""Speaker 2: You know, Maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone.""Speaker 1: Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.""Speaker 2: Here it is.""Speaker 1: It appears that you have late fees.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: Yes, Really.""Speaker 2: How much do I owe?""Speaker 1: You owe $ 24. 50 in late fees.""Speaker 2: I don't have that much today.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry, But until you pay it, You won't be able to check out any more books.""Speaker 2: It is? Oh, That's nice.""Speaker 1: Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited?""Speaker 2: Actually, I'd forgotten about it.""Speaker 1: Forgotten about it? How could you?""Speaker 2: Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish.""Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.""Speaker 2: It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian.""Speaker 1: I guess so. So what do you do around this time of year?""Speaker 2: Well, I'll celebrate Hanukah soon, But that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you. Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break.""Speaker 1: Well, Would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house?""Speaker 2: It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market.""Speaker 1: It's the marketing's fault, I suppose. What do you want to do?""Speaker 2: Well, I want to become just like Bruce Lee. What should I do?""Speaker 1: That's a long way to go, I'm afraid. First of all, You gotta grow up.""Speaker 2: I am still young. And I'm growing every minute.""Speaker 1: Sure. Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope.""Speaker 2: I love running. Anything else?""Speaker 1: Please change your clothes first!""Speaker 2: I'm perfect with my clothes. And I do not have anything else with me.""Speaker 1: Sorry, But no jeans here.""Speaker 2: How can I join it?""Speaker 1: There will be an information session about the Students 'Union this Tuesday. You can apply for it then.""Speaker 2: Don't mistake her as somebody. She's my older sister.""Speaker 2: What do you do in winter?""Speaker 1: Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I'm feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.""Speaker 2: I think most people do. I like wearing nice, Colorful clothes in summer, You know, A nice dress or skirt. It's too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter.""Speaker 1: Yes. I like wearing shorts in summer. My legs would freeze!""Speaker 2: Do you think we'll have a nice summer this year?""Speaker 2: I've been invited over to a friend's, And you?""Speaker 2: It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.""Speaker 1: And how long does the course last?""Speaker 2: It lasts for 9 months.""Speaker 1: When does it start?""Speaker 2: The next beginning class starts on October 25th.""Speaker 1: What time is the class?""Speaker 2: From 7 to 9 o'clock.""Speaker 1: How much does it cost?""Speaker 2: It costs 125 dollars a month.""Speaker 1: Yes, That's all right. I want to enroll in the course.""Speaker 2: Thank you, Please fill out this form for us.""Speaker 1: Do you want me to fill it out now?""Speaker 2: I have a good idea to solve it. The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes.""Speaker 1: It would probably be very expensive.""Speaker 2: I think the government can afford it. Besides, There are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i.""Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don't seem to have enough money to educate kids properly.""Speaker 2: If we are to invest more money to education, We will need to raise taxes. That wouldn't be popular with voters.""Speaker 1: Most voters what everything both ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, But without increasing taxes.""Speaker 2: The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: And not expensive either.""Speaker 2: Oh, I don't care about that.""Speaker 1: Everybody is buying them.""Speaker 2: Are they?""Speaker 1: Yes, They are very fashionable, You see.""Speaker 2: I am afraid I am not interested in fashion.""Speaker 1: I see.""Speaker 2: But thank you very much all the same.""Speaker 2: Don't you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn't make sense to meet at the apartment.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry. We must have misunderstood each other.""Speaker 2: Why don't you try to be clearer about your intentions?""Speaker 1: You're right. I am sorry. Let's go and watch the movie.""Speaker 2: I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today!""Speaker 1: It's just one exam. Can youre-take the exam?""Speaker 2: Yes, But it's so humiliating! I don't want my friends to know I failed!""Speaker 1: Why didn't you do a good job?""Speaker 2: I don't know. I sat down in my seat, Looked at my paper, And then my mind just went totally blank.""Speaker 1: Do you think you studied enough for the exam?""Speaker 2: No...""Speaker 1: What did you do last night?""Speaker 2: I watched TV.""Speaker 1: Did you study at all last night for your exam?""Speaker 2: No, Not really.""Speaker 1: I am sure if you had studied, You would have done well. When can youre-take your exam?""Speaker 2: Tomorrow.""Speaker 2: I don't have the slightest idea.""Speaker 1: Someone you're living with.""Speaker 2: What? Not my Dad, I hope!?""Speaker 1: Come on, Mary, It's your brother, Jack.""Speaker 2: No kidding! Jack is such a log! He's never dated a girl.""Speaker 1: The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him.""Speaker 2: And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls. He's putting his heart into his stamp collection.""Speaker 2: It's hard to believe that you like it. You are so easy to be satisfied.""Speaker 1: Hey, It's not that bad. The food is nutritious and it's really convenient. I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff.""Speaker 2: Eating is important. You are what you eat. It's not only a daily routine.""Speaker 1: Well, Will you just go back to work after lunch?""Speaker 2: No. I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch.""Speaker 1: But you didn't eat anything today.""Speaker 2: Well, The bill is paid by month. That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant.""Speaker 1: All right. I'm going to the McDonald's.""Speaker 2: For what? I thought you didn't like western food.""Speaker 1: No, I never did. It's for my son. He loves it, And I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week.""Speaker 2: That's really smart. My son Daniel is the same with your son. I just don't get it, Why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food.""Speaker 1: Me, Either. But, It's for sure that the children market is a really big one.""Speaker 2: I want to check these books out.""Speaker 1: Is that all?""Speaker 2: That's all.""Speaker 1: May I see your library card, Please?""Speaker 2: It's right here.""Speaker 1: Will that be all for today?""Speaker 2: Yes. That's it.""Speaker 1: These are due back in two weeks.""Speaker 2: More and more people like it now. Fewer people play table tennis than before. Many people like swimming, Because it is fun and keeps you fit.""Speaker 1: In my country, Many people enjoy golf, But it is too expensive for some people. A few people like extreme sports, But I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them.""Speaker 2: Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people. Several people from my university enjoy them, But most of us just watch. No one I know plays golf.""Speaker 1: I know loads of people who play it regularly. There are plenty of golf courses around the country. In the past, Only a tiny number of people played.""Speaker 2: A great deal of people follow rugby in my country.""Speaker 2: Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch.""Speaker 2: I'm going to put on more clothes, Too.""Speaker 1: Will it snow today?""Speaker 2: I don't know. Do you like snowing?""Speaker 1: Yes, When it snows, Every where is white. It's very beautiful.""Speaker 2: You can read the newspaper. Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not.""Speaker 2: It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land. Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach.""Speaker 1: Is it just a bus?""Speaker 2: Oh. No. The motor coach is air-conditioned, There is a galley for food preparation, Movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need.""Speaker 2: Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate. Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year.""Speaker 1: Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday?""Speaker 2: Oh, It's unbelievable. She is such a chain smoker.""Speaker 1: Yes, Yes. She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby.""Speaker 2: Good gracious! Are you sure?""Speaker 1: I am. What's more, His wife is 84.""Speaker 2: Is she really?""Speaker 1: Yes, She is. And guess what, He is her sixth husband.""Speaker 2: I was thinking about it, But I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution. Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice.""Speaker 1: Yeah I know what you mean. That's why this year I am keeping things more simple. Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time, Or doing some volunteering work.""Speaker 2: That seems reasonable. We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.""Speaker 1: Sure, As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight!""Speaker 2: Be careful, Tom. Those are pretty heavy.""Speaker 2: Yeah? How's he doing?""Speaker 1: He's doing well. We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.""Speaker 2: Oh yeah?""Speaker 1: Well, We were talking and catching up on what we'Ve been doing, Talking about work and family, When all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it! He started freaking out, And screaming...""Speaker 2: Ha ha, Really?""Speaker 2: Jump in, I'll give you a ride.""Speaker 1: Ok. Boy, This looks expensive.""Speaker 2: Yeah, It costed a bundle alright.""Speaker 1: Wow, This's sinking a hole.""Speaker 2: Yeah, This sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned.""Speaker 1: I believe it. Hoo, This car corners like it's on rails.""Speaker 2: We are on the high way. I'm the * *.""Speaker 1: Wow, This car can really burn rubber.""Speaker 2: It's a great feeling.""Speaker 1: You made a perfect choice, Jack.""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: No. That's incomplete.""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: What's your mailing address?""Speaker 2: 456 Cherry Drive, Pasadena, Ca 91170.""Speaker 1: That's correct.""Speaker 2: So what's the problem?""Speaker 1: Bulldog 123 is just the street. You have to give me the city, State, And ZIP code.""Speaker 2: Tell me the problem.""Speaker 1: I have two classes on here that are at the same time.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see.""Speaker 1: Can you change that for me?""Speaker 2: Do you still want both classes?""Speaker 1: Yes, I would like to keep both classes.""Speaker 2: I'll try to change one to a different day.""Speaker 2: Running a farm would be totally different to you current job.""Speaker 1: That's one reason I'd like to try it. I'd really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office.""Speaker 2: You'd need a lot of training before becoming a farmer. It's not something you can just walk into.""Speaker 1: My uncle owns a farm and I'Ve spent some time working with him. I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields.""Speaker 2: You mean visit a factory?""Speaker 1: Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry.""Speaker 2: Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure, But as far as I know, Most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour.""Speaker 2: Really? What do the companies do that for?""Speaker 1: I believe most of them think of it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors.""Speaker 1: Exactly.""Speaker 2: Do we need an appointment beforehand?""Speaker 2: Yes, They are different! But it's too professional. What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake. Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin?""Speaker 1: Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins. We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines. We can judge it with naked eyes.""Speaker 2: I see. By the way, China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history. Did they issue their own coins in China?""Speaker 1: Certainly, They did. Liao Coins and Song Coins, For example, Coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago. The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style, Just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe. Let me look for one and show you.""Speaker 2: It may take many years for the trees to grow. I hope people will stop cutting down trees.""Speaker 1: But we need the wood.""Speaker 2: Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop?""Speaker 1: It's a problem, Because my boss is in that shop now.""Speaker 2: Ok, I will go there myself.""Speaker 1: Sorry, Mr. Polly.""Speaker 2: It doesn't matter. Oh, God, I have only four dollars in my wallet. Is that possible for me to buy one?""Speaker 2: I usually don't have time for a bath in the mornings, So I just take a shower. Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one, Especially if it's winter and I need to warm up.""Speaker 1: Do you shave every morning?""Speaker 2: I shave every workday, But I only shave at weekends if I'm going out somewhere. If I'm staying at home, I don't shave.""Speaker 1: Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend?""Speaker 2: Yes. I brush my teeth in the morning, Just before I go to work. It's actually the last thing I do before leaving. Then I brush again before bed.""Speaker 2: Yes. Is that so important?""Speaker 1: Frankly yes. We like to employ married people. By the way, Do you have any children?""Speaker 2: Would you like another one?""Speaker 1: No. Can I have my money back?""Speaker 2: Hmm... Have you got a receipt?""Speaker 1: A receipt?""Speaker 2: Yes. I must see your receipt. You can't have your money back without receipt.""Speaker 2: Yes. I'Ve got a meeting in a minute.""Speaker 1: Okay. I won't hold you up then.""Speaker 2: Right. I'll see you later.""Speaker 2: Every day I have less money! I haven't spent anything, It is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate.""Speaker 1: What we really should be making investment in is the Euro. I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter, I think it's about time to buy in.""Speaker 2: What about the Yen?""Speaker 2: While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries.""Speaker 1: That is a really interesting fact.""Speaker 2: I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach.""Speaker 1: Just do whatever you feel like doing.""Speaker 2: ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy. Let's put the stuff under the tree.""Speaker 1: Good idea. It is always cooler in a shade.""Speaker 2: What's the hurry?""Speaker 1: I must catch the nine-thirty Train.""Speaker 2: It's my health-conscious lunch, Good for my health and beauty.""Speaker 2: Carson. It's nice to mee you, Too.""Speaker 1: The weather is so warm for December, Don't you think?""Speaker 2: It is unusually warm. I blame it on global warming.""Speaker 1: Global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere.""Speaker 2: So sure. Are you from around here?""Speaker 1: No. I'm new here. I just moved here a few months ago.""Speaker 2: Where are you from?""Speaker 1: I'm from China. What about you?""Speaker 2: I am from Texas. I was in China once, But it was a long time ago.""Speaker 1: Did you enjoy it?""Speaker 2: I did. I especially liked the food. What do you think about the food here?""Speaker 1: It's very different from Chinese food, But I am getting used to it.""Speaker 2: Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there?""Speaker 1: Yes, Have you read it?""Speaker 2: No, But I saw the movie. What do you think about it?""Speaker 1: Well, To be honest, I've only gotten though 10 pages of it. So far, Though, It's interesting.""Speaker 2: Well, This is my stop. It was nice talking with you.""Speaker 2: What's the matter?""Speaker 1: This machine is out of order.""Speaker 2: You shouldn't have used the machine. Did you lose your money?""Speaker 1: I sure did.""Speaker 2: How about taking a walk in the park?""Speaker 1: Ok. It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh.""Speaker 2: ( After they entering the park ) Great, It's so quiet here. We have the park to ourselves, Only you and me.""Speaker 1: Are you kidding? Don't you see many people over there? Just on your right.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see them. Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people.""Speaker 2: Well. Mary had promised to be my date, But she stood me up. I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind.""Speaker 1: What about the party?""Speaker 2: It was boring. The music was too slow and the food was lousy and, Above all, I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time.""Speaker 1: So how long did you stay?""Speaker 2: Actually, The company will provide you with all of these supplies. So, You can leave this very thick notebook at home.""Speaker 1: I know. But it is my lucky charm. I carry it all the time.""Speaker 2: Oh, Tom! They sound fantastic. I really like all those things.""Speaker 1: Yeah... Me, Too.""Speaker 2: Well, Except fishing. To be honest, I hate fishing, But I love all the others.""Speaker 1: Hey! Look at this! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach.""Speaker 2: You know. I really don't those big hotels.""Speaker 2: Ok, Then put on your glasses, And do you know what does the panda eat?""Speaker 1: Of course, Bamboo!""Speaker 2: That's right.""Speaker 1: I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship.""Speaker 2: You sound quite knowledgeable.""Speaker 1: Not really, Panda is my favorite animal.""Speaker 2: Actually, It likes milk too.""Speaker 1: Any way, In a word, Panda is our friend.""Speaker 2: Do you know other famous animals in the world?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Let me think, The kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous.""Speaker 2: Okay, Forget about that.S, Do you have some practical dreams at present?""Speaker 1: I do. And now I'm working hard to learn English, And I want to be an interpreter some day.""Speaker 2: You're promising. Just follow your dream and never give up.""Speaker 2: Tom... You are her boss, You down. Of course, She's helpful to you.""Speaker 1: Come on. She's like that with everyone.""Speaker 2: Actually, I am learning that now. But it's too hard for me. You know the four tones and the stuff. It really freaks me out.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. All things are difficult before they are easy.""Speaker 2: You hit the nail right on the head.""Speaker 1: Well, Are you invested in some language-exchange program?""Speaker 2: What is it?""Speaker 1: It's where I teach you Chinese, And in exchange you teach me English.""Speaker 2: Awesome. I've been giving this a lot of thought. When can we do this?""Speaker 1: How about this sunday?""Speaker 2: Ok, Cool.""Speaker 2: Hi, I'm Susan Marshall, You can call me Susan. Nice to meet you.""Speaker 1: What do you do, Susan?""Speaker 2: Well, I'm a college student. How about you?""Speaker 2: I want to go to Shanghai, But I also want to visit Hainan.""Speaker 1: Then which will be your first choice?""Speaker 2: I don't know. How about you? Are you staying here or somewhere.""Speaker 1: I have decided to go toTasha.""Speaker 2: By train or by plane?""Speaker 2: What teams are playing tonight?""Speaker 1: Ac Milan versus Real Madrid.""Speaker 2: That will be a tough match, Right?""Speaker 1: Absolutely.""Speaker 2: What are we waiting for? It's already 7 pm now. Let's buy some drinks and desserts now.""Speaker 2: He doesn't lift a finger! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon.""Speaker 1: Man, What a freeloader. You better do something quick or he'll never hit the road. After all, He's got it made in the shade here.""Speaker 2: You think he might stay even longer?!""Speaker 1: Now, Don't go losing your temper. If you tolerated all you can, Just kick him out... But do it with gloves. I know! Tell him a white lie like you're getting the house fumigated!""Speaker 2: Why don't we just make it a friendly game?""Speaker 2: Mike suggests me to return it.""Speaker 2: I couldn't agree with you more. There aren't enough educational programs, And even the news shows are not well done.""Speaker 2: I bought it at half price.""Speaker 2: My favourite is Jasmine tea. I like its aroma.""Speaker 2: I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. That's a real let-down.""Speaker 1: I don't think she will do such a thing.""Speaker 2: But she did and made me disappointed.""Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up. A girlfriend is not everything.""Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.""Speaker 2: Why? You mean a lot to me.""Speaker 1: Why didn't you answer my question?""Speaker 2: What question?""Speaker 1: Do you love me? Come on, I'm eager to hear.""Speaker 2: You know that I care for you. I---I'm proud of you.""Speaker 1: Don't cherish your words, Dear.""Speaker 2: I want to become certified in computer programming. Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education?""Speaker 1: Yes, We offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects.""Speaker 2: How do I sign up?""Speaker 1: If you give me your address, I can mail you an information packet and the application forms.""Speaker 2: Well, I have to take biology, Chemistry, Maps and physics. What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors.""Speaker 1: Yes, I'm really weak in maps, I did poorly in high school.""Speaker 2: That's marketing research... But what about getting started once you have an idea?""Speaker 1: After you have your great idea, Then you can set up shop by registering a domain name, Creating a website, An email address, And a hosting service. If you want to go all out on your website, You can put together shopping cart technology, But that can be pricey to start out with.""Speaker 2: Sounds like a lot of work!""Speaker 2: I don't know.""Speaker 1: Why don't you phone her for a date again?""Speaker 2: I did phone her this morning, But she hung up on me. I think she is going to walk out on me.""Speaker 1: Don't jump to conclusions. Look at the bright side, Try to make another date again.""Speaker 2: Oh, Great! I love it! You know I've been expecting this for a long time.""Speaker 1: I'm very glad to hear that.""Speaker 2: What will you do on Teachers 'Day?""Speaker 1: I am going to send Mr. Li some flowers. What about you?""Speaker 2: Don't count on it. I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner.""Speaker 2: No problem. Call me when you get back.""Speaker 1: I should have some free time next week. Say, Next Wednesday evening?""Speaker 2: That's good for me, But do you think you'll be back by then? I'd really like to see you.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday.""Speaker 2: Great! That's settled then.""Speaker 2: A second language is always difficult.""Speaker 1: True, But English is harder than most. It's a crazy language.""Speaker 2: A crazy language? Why do you say that?""Speaker 1: One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings.""Speaker 2: For protection. Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air.""Speaker 1: So there isn't air in the glass boxes?""Speaker 2: No, There isn't. There is a vacuum in every box.""Speaker 1: I wonder how old these things are. Thousands of years?""Speaker 2: Yeah, They all come from a very ancient time.""Speaker 1: Hey, Look at the tripod. I've seen it on TV.""Speaker 2: I don't know what to wear! Ok, Give me your opinion. Do you like the way this looks? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I'll wear these as well.""Speaker 1: Are you joking? What am I going to do with you? We are going to a dinner party not the beach! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants. It's chilly outside so you can wear this coat.""Speaker 2: Here they are.""Speaker 1: It appears these books are two weeks late.""Speaker 2: I forgot they were due.""Speaker 1: You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees, Right?""Speaker 2: How much is the late fee?""Speaker 1: The late fee is 25 cents a day.""Speaker 2: So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late?""Speaker 1: It's 25 cents for each book.""Speaker 2: I don't even wanna talk about it. It killed me!""Speaker 1: How long were you in the chair?""Speaker 2: It took quite a while, But the worst part was getting numbed. They had to give me 3 shoots.""Speaker 1: Well, I guess you've learned a good lesson, Huh. You have to take good care of your teeth.""Speaker 2: No kidding. Not only can't I stand the pain, But man... Dentists are expensive. The bill is going to be humungous!""Speaker 1: Don't you have a dental insurance?""Speaker 2: We're having some friends over. What are you doing?""Speaker 2: I'm ready! Whoa, What a hard throw! I can't get that!""Speaker 1: Catch it, Yi-jun! Run to the ball! Uh-oh! Slow down, You're going to hit...""Speaker 2: No, There aren't. This map just show the geographical features. Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world.""Speaker 1: The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, Most countries are tiny.""Speaker 2: I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall.""Speaker 1: Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon.""Speaker 2: The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate.""Speaker 2: Don't your relatives visit other relatives?""Speaker 1: Yes, But Americans never visit without calling in advance, And they almost never stay overnight.""Speaker 2: I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families.""Speaker 2: Ok kids, Here 'sa beach ball and a Frisbee, A pail and a shovel. I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave. Don't stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.""Speaker 1: And stay in the shallow area. I don't want to see you go any farther than that sandbar! It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your floatier.""Speaker 2: You're back already? The water was too cold, Huh? I'll tell you a secret. Do you see that small pool of water over there? It'll be warmer in there. Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some.""Speaker 1: What is that? A jellyfish? Jeremy, Put that down right now! It could sting you!""Speaker 2: I think first of all for first-time students, Coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security.""Speaker 1: Anything else?""Speaker 2: Uh, When you live off campus, There might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus.""Speaker 1: I will think over your advice.""Speaker 2: Well, Of course, The choice is up to you. Good luck!""Speaker 2: He is everybody's type.""Speaker 1: What position does he play?""Speaker 2: Shooting guard. The same as Michael Jordan!""Speaker 1: Oh, I love Michael Jordan. He fills people's lives with great excitement.""Speaker 2: Used to. But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this. But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now.""Speaker 1: Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer.""Speaker 2: That is not true. They are just jealous of him!""Speaker 1: Jordan is a legend, Anyway. An idol that no one can replace. I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player. He is not just about muscles he also plays smart.""Speaker 2: You know what, He is also an outstanding football player. He is surely to be a star of tomorrow.""Speaker 1: By the way, Do you know if he has a girl friend?""Speaker 2: You are so not here! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders.""Speaker 2: I think we should discourage people from using their private cars. They produce too much pollution!""Speaker 1: I agree, But I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient.""Speaker 2: Cars might be convenient, But they're so bad for the environment.""Speaker 1: Do you have a car?""Speaker 2: No. I used to have one though. Once I started using my bicycle to get around, I found that I didn't really need it.""Speaker 1: Maybe if I sold my car now, I wouldn't be so tempted to use it.""Speaker 2: You could try. It would save you a lot of money.""Speaker 1: That's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, Insurance, And repairs.""Speaker 2: If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, You will get lots of exercise, Too!""Speaker 1: I could stand to lose a few pounds. Having a car has made me lazy. I never end up walking anywhere!""Speaker 2: Let's go to a car dealership. I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price.""Speaker 2: I don't like it. I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours. Above all, I hate talking to those poker faces everyday.""Speaker 1: Well, You have to take the bad with the good.""Speaker 2: Does it close at that time every day?""Speaker 1: Not always.""Speaker 2: Is the library open on Saturdays?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: What time do you open and close on Saturday?""Speaker 1: The hours are from 9 am - 6.""Speaker 2: Okay. Thank you very much.""Speaker 1: Do you need anything else?""Speaker 2: At least the subway is better than the bus. It's faster for one thing. And usually less crowded. But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus. It adds up over time, If you take it every day.""Speaker 1: That's true. The bus is even worse. Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired! Hey, How do you get to work every day?""Speaker 2: I ride my bike. I don't live too far away, So it's pretty convenient. It's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office.""Speaker 1: I'll bet it's good exercise, Too... A good way to keep fit.""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women.""Speaker 2: In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are. In writing you have to produce language, You have to create your own words on a blank page.""Speaker 1: Oh, Now I see what you mean. When you're reading, You are just looking, But when you are writing, You are actually doing something!""Speaker 2: A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge. Don't you think so?""Speaker 1: I think I see what you mean. I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can't write it.""Speaker 2: Exactly.""Speaker 1: So I have another question for you. What do you think is harder, Speaking or understanding?""Speaker 2: They're both harder than reading or writing.""Speaker 1: In what way?""Speaker 2: Because they are direct communication with another person, And there's a time limit. This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners, Even for those who know lots of English.""Speaker 1: You are making me feel really discouraged.""Speaker 2: It's a great car. It's very comfortable and it goes really fast.""Speaker 1: Was it expensive?""Speaker 2: Put it this way – it wasn't cheap.""Speaker 1: What colour is it?""Speaker 2: Never thought about it, I sure you are right. It's quite a short walk.""Speaker 2: Great, Do you need directions to my office?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure.""Speaker 2: Well, Just make sure to go through the double doors, And I'll be on the right.""Speaker 1: Ok, I'll find it.""Speaker 2: It's very easy to find.""Speaker 1: See you then.""Speaker 2: Take it easy! Let's go to the mall, Window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like.""Speaker 1: That's just it! I don't know what to get her! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small! I suck at getting presents for people.""Speaker 2: That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess peoples' likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like!""Speaker 1: Yeah, You're right. When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Tell me about it. I know! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, Right? Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod.""Speaker 2: Yes, It is lovely. I have been expecting something like this for a long time. Thanks ever so much.""Speaker 1: Where to meet?""Speaker 2: In the market.""Speaker 1: Ok. Bottoms up.""Speaker 2: Bottoms up.""Speaker 1: It's on me.""Speaker 2: Well, You'd better get some more warm clothes.""Speaker 1: What's the temperature today anyway?""Speaker 2: I don't know about that, But I do think that it helps people relax.""Speaker 1: What other kind of music do you listen to?""Speaker 2: Actually, I mostly just listen classical music. What about you?""Speaker 1: To be honest, I think classical music is too complicated for me.""Speaker 2: What kind of music do you prefer then?""Speaker 1: I like pop music. Do you?""Speaker 2: Not really. I don't think pop music has much depth.""Speaker 1: I see what you mean. I think that's way I like it so much.""Speaker 2: How long have you been in to pop music, Then?""Speaker 1: I've always been into it. Have you always liked classical music?""Speaker 2: Not really. When I was little, We didn't really listen to music at all.""Speaker 1: So, How did you become interested in it?""Speaker 2: Well, When I was about 10 years old, I started playing the piano. I think that's how it all started.""Speaker 1: Do you still play piano?""Speaker 2: I'd love to try some snacks.""Speaker 1: ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting. What do you want to have?""Speaker 2: Kebabs and roast squid.""Speaker 1: Can I have a bite?""Speaker 2: Help yourself.""Speaker 2: Self-service?""Speaker 1: Yes. You must fill up the car yourself.""Speaker 2: Are you serious?""Speaker 1: Yes. Are you traveling here?""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm from Taiwan. I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car.""Speaker 1: In America, Most gas stations are like this.""Speaker 2: Do I really have to do it? I don't know how.""Speaker 1: Well, Since this is your first time, I will do it for you. But next time, If you want a full-service gas station, You should look at the sign.""Speaker 2: What sign?""Speaker 1: Under the sign for the gas station, There will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service. And some gas stations have both. But if they have both, Some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve. You have to look at the signs.""Speaker 2: I kind of like it. He looks better that way, Doesn't he? More presidential.""Speaker 1: I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys.""Speaker 2: Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts?""Speaker 1: Well, For example, The Wall Street Journal is very, Very good. Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin.""Speaker 2: I like to read Fortune.""Speaker 1: Good. Fortune is usually ahead of the curve. And Business Week is very solid, Too.""Speaker 2: Where does a broadcast company get most of their information? I hope it's not just from press releases.""Speaker 1: A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases. Their people go out and do real reporting, Talking to people at the stock exchange, Fund managers, Analysts, Etc.""Speaker 2: But sometimes when a flimsy report, Or even a rumor gets on television, There's going to be a terrible 'echo chamber' effect.""Speaker 2: I didn't do well in last exams. If my father knows it, He will beat me up.""Speaker 1: I can't believe it. My parents never beat me.""Speaker 2: You know that my father is irritable.""Speaker 1: You can ask the teacher for help.""Speaker 2: You aren't going to a strip club, Are you? I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friends party.""Speaker 1: Aw come on! It's just some innocent fun! You know how these things are! We are gonna play drinking games, Get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.""Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.""Speaker 1: Come on! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn't mind you going to her bachelorette party!""Speaker 2: I think that for a lot of people, It's just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries.""Speaker 1: I think the Olympics help to promote world peace.""Speaker 2: I'm not sure about that. We still have many wars in the world. I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one, But the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete. There's no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other.""Speaker 1: You are so pessimistic! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed, Skill, Agility and strength. Most people hope to see someone from their country win, But I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete.""Speaker 2: Well. I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics.""Speaker 2: Oh, The whole house needsre-painting for starters. The carpet in the living room is worn out, And I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting. Last week, I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet. Anyway, All par for the course when you own a house, I guess. I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over.""Speaker 1: I'Ve studied home decoration as a hobby. Could I make some suggestions?""Speaker 2: Go right ahead.""Speaker 1: Well, I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room, And maybe some newdrapes for the windows. Also, A grandfather clock would look great in the den. Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room.""Speaker 2: Well, You really do have a talent for this, Alice. Thanks for the suggestions.""Speaker 2: Not even funny, Billy. This is my new snapshot sticker camera.""Speaker 1: What's that supposed to mean?""Speaker 2: At the Gate.""Speaker 1: When, Did you say?""Speaker 2: Round about seven.""Speaker 1: Who's coming?""Speaker 2: Peter. Peter Brown, You know. Don't forget to bring the letter.""Speaker 1: Sorry. I didn't quite catch what you said. There's a lot of noise outside.""Speaker 2: I told you not to forget to bring the letter.""Speaker 2: What's wrong?""Speaker 1: There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.""Speaker 2: I see! Do you want to ask her out?""Speaker 1: Sure, But how?""Speaker 2: You can ask her out for drinks after work.""Speaker 1: But for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.""Speaker 2: Then you've got a lot of work to do. You need to get her to notice you first.""Speaker 1: Easier said than done.""Speaker 2: You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying 'hello' to her.""Speaker 1: But I always get tongue-tied when I see her.""Speaker 2: That's something you need to overcome. Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased.""Speaker 1: I see. I'll try.""Speaker 2: Well, There is a play on campus this weekend.""Speaker 1: Good idea. That's why i think i have culture. You have any other suggestions?""Speaker 2: What's the matter with these ideas?""Speaker 1: They are good, But i still need a few more.""Speaker 2: What about going on a picnic?""Speaker 1: Cool, But what if the weather is not ideal?""Speaker 2: You can also take her to the art museum or a cafe. Certainly, I must come up with something you can use. How do you like the ideas i am giving you?""Speaker 2: Really? What's he been doing?""Speaker 1: You know, Just giving me lots to do. I'm really busy right now.""Speaker 2: Are you? What are you busy with?""Speaker 2: Some friends of my parents live out there, And they invited me there.""Speaker 1: So, What did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, Obviously.""Speaker 2: I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn't get through a whole game before I had to sit down.""Speaker 1: Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming?""Speaker 2: I wanted to, But the water is too cold, And I just wetted in up to my knees.""Speaker 1: It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that.""Speaker 2: Thank you for the invitation.""Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?""Speaker 2: Are you applying to study or work abroad?""Speaker 1: I want to study abroad.""Speaker 2: What do you want to study?""Speaker 1: I hope to study English Literature.""Speaker 2: Have you got your visa yet?""Speaker 1: Not yet. I have an interview with a visa official today.""Speaker 2: I see. Is it your first interview?""Speaker 2: It's a good idea. But I am afraid it's too cold. It is very windy on the lake.""Speaker 2: Beth, What date is today?""Speaker 1: Today is Saturday.""Speaker 2: What is the date today?""Speaker 1: Today is July 4th.""Speaker 2: Oh, I almost forgot. Today is my mom's birthday.""Speaker 1: Call her on my cell phone. Wish her “ Happy Birthday! � Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness. Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day.""Speaker 2: Thanks! I will do that! When is your birthday?""Speaker 1: It is December 25th.""Speaker 2: Wow! What a lucky girl! Your birthday is on Christmas Day.""Speaker 1: Yes, I am lucky. I was born on Christ's birthday. Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays. When is your birthday?""Speaker 2: April 2nd. I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day. I guess I am lucky, Too!""Speaker 1: That is true! Here, Have some Granola for breakfast.""Speaker 2: Thanks.""Speaker 1: After eating, We will take down our tent. Then we will pack everything into the canoe, We can shove off by 6.""Speaker 2: I guess so.""Speaker 1: How about going for swim around 10.""Speaker 2: That should work out great. You are miracle worker! You have got me awake and motivated.""Speaker 2: Of course. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer...""Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.""Speaker 2: You're dancing so well.""Speaker 1: You dance beautifully too.""Speaker 2: When did you learn to dance?""Speaker 1: In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?""Speaker 2: It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz.""Speaker 1: How about tango?""Speaker 2: Oh, I like it. It's such a beautiful dance, But I can't do it well. What about you?""Speaker 1: Tango is my favorite. Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot.""Speaker 2: Thank you for the dance.""Speaker 1: My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.""Speaker 2: He's standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer. Now he's hanging some strong strings on the nails.""Speaker 1: And what's Mrs. King doing?""Speaker 2: She's bringing something pink for Mr. King to drink. Now she's putting it... Ok.""Speaker 1: What's happening?""Speaker 2: The ladder's falling?""Speaker 1: What's Mr. King doing?""Speaker 2: He's hanging from the string. He's holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs. King.""Speaker 1: And is she helping him?""Speaker 2: No, She's running toward our house. That's her ringing the bell.""Speaker 2: Matinee or evening?""Speaker 1: Evening.""Speaker 2: Circle or stalls?""Speaker 1: Stalls.""Speaker 2: Why don't you park in the parking structure for students?""Speaker 1: Where is the parking structure at?""Speaker 2: It's on the west side of the campus.""Speaker 1: Do you know if the parking structure is full or not?""Speaker 2: It was empty last time I went up there.""Speaker 1: How long ago was that?""Speaker 2: I went up there early this morning.""Speaker 1: Do you think it'll be full now?""Speaker 2: I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts, So it might be interesting. I read a review today and the critic didn't seem to be very impressed.""Speaker 1: What did the critic say?""Speaker 2: He didn't say it was bad, But he said that it wasn't as good as it could have been, Particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it.""Speaker 1: The movie starts at eight o 'clock, So we have plenty of time to eat and get ready.""Speaker 2: Good. Dinner is nearly ready and I'd like to watch the news before we go. The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results.""Speaker 2: But why? Did I do anything wrong?""Speaker 1: No, We are just too different. This isn't working.""Speaker 2: Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.""Speaker 1: I have thought about it for a while. I think it's time to move on for both of us.""Speaker 2: But I still love you.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry.""Speaker 2: I knew this would happen some day...""Speaker 1: Then why didn't you talk to me?""Speaker 2: Well. It's not all my fault, Anna...""Speaker 1: I don't want to argue with you anymore. This is going to be tough, But Let's try and be friends.""Speaker 2: I would like that Anna, But I think I'll need a little space for a bit.""Speaker 1: I think we'll be better off if we are apart.""Speaker 2: Shall we keep Our friendship?""Speaker 2: Really? What kind of prizes?""Speaker 1: Well, I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car!""Speaker 2: A new car! You're kidding!""Speaker 1: No, Really! And she told me the secret to winning, Wear red underwear!""Speaker 2: Wear red underwear?! Does that really work? Are you going to try it?""Speaker 1: Of course! I'm not only going to wear red underwear, But I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt, Too!""Speaker 2: Oh, My. What did you do?""Speaker 1: I guess I was stunned for a moment, Then I quickly ran away to get help.""Speaker 2: Did you call the police?""Speaker 2: Oh, Speaking of the conductor, He is indeed a genius. He did a perfect job. His name is Menuhin, A descendent of Russian American immigrants.""Speaker 1: Oh, I learned that he is also a legendary violinist.""Speaker 2: Absolutely right. He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto. That caused a sensation. The audience were stunned by his pure tone.""Speaker 1: Obviously you did enjoy the concert.""Speaker 2: You must be joking. Those two?""Speaker 1: Well, My dear, I didn't believe it either. But I got it straight from the horse's mouth. David called me this morning.""Speaker 2: So when did this all happen?""Speaker 1: Last weekend, While they were on their ski trip.""Speaker 2: Well, I believe it now, And when are they are getting married?""Speaker 1: Next June.""Speaker 2: Daniel, Hold on for a minute. What are you trying to pull there?""Speaker 1: Nothing. Just that I don't care for these carrots. Hi,Sis., I saw you buy some chocolate cakes. I am done with the main course. It's about time for some dessert.""Speaker 2: Oh, You want my chocolate cakes, So to speak!""Speaker 1: No, No, I'm just thinking of some dessert. And I have had enough carrots.""Speaker 2: Daniel, Carrots contain much Vitamin C. It is good for you.""Speaker 1: I know, But chocolate cake is even better.""Speaker 2: Oh, Stop it! You know you need vegetables. You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet, Now.""Speaker 2: ( at the dance ) That band is playing good music. Shall we dance?""Speaker 1: Fine, What do you call this?""Speaker 2: Foxtrot. Oh. You're a good dancer.""Speaker 1: Really? Thank you. I am thinking the same thing about you.""Speaker 2: Do you mean this Saturday?""Speaker 1: Yes, This coming Saturday.""Speaker 2: Thanks for inviting me, Jack, But I'Ve already made plans for this weekend. I won't be able to come, I'm afraid.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that.""Speaker 2: Yeah, That's too bad.""Speaker 2: You can say that. But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places, Too.""Speaker 1: Cool. Your guitar skills are very impressive. How did you learn to play like that?""Speaker 2: I picked up guitar at an early age, Maybe around 8 years old. Afterward, I taught myself by listening to some records of top players.""Speaker 2: Excuse me. I wonder see Dean Mr. Lee first. I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is?""Speaker 1: Certainly. Mr. Lee's office building at the south end of the campus, Just beside the library.""Speaker 2: Excuse me?""Speaker 1: Let me show you the way. Please follow me.""Speaker 2: Thank you very much. It's very kind of you.""Speaker 1: My pleasure.""Speaker 2: This is it?""Speaker 2: At least you know what American women generally like in a man.""Speaker 1: Believe it or not, I guess American women like a man in good shape, Which Chinese women may not care about so much. That's my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.""Speaker 2: American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, There aren't many chances.""Speaker 1: No, That's not true. I'Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese. But those Chinese look very strong and healthy. So if you exercise more often, I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls. How old is Jacky Chan? He's small and short. But I bet he can have any American woman he wants.""Speaker 2: You know, That's going to be a tremendous change for me. Because I never exercise.""Speaker 2: Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music. You can dance to heavy metal.""Speaker 1: Hey, You can dance to rap music!""Speaker 2: She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese.""Speaker 1: Wow!!!""Speaker 2: And she's good at sports, Too. She knows how to play tennis and basketball.""Speaker 1: That's terrific!""Speaker 2: But there's one thing she's not good at.""Speaker 1: What's that?""Speaker 2: That depends. Some semesters have many, Some don't. And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers. That's easy.""Speaker 1: And when do you prepare for your final exam?""Speaker 2: Honestly speaking, Most students prepare it one month before the exam.""Speaker 1: Really? You only review your lessons in one month? Does it work?""Speaker 2: Of course, It's useful. And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes, Because most questions in the exam are based on them.""Speaker 1: Wow, And all the key points are included in them? You're so smart!""Speaker 2: But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine. We have to stay up late.""Speaker 1: Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night?""Speaker 2: I had a pretty strict upbringing, And my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me.""Speaker 1: Where did you go to university?""Speaker 2: My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing, But I decided to go back to England. I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication.""Speaker 1: What is your current occupation?""Speaker 2: I am a journalist. I write for China Daily.""Speaker 1: Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation?""Speaker 2: No, I didn't. I started working at a university in London but as time went by, I found I did not really like my job. I decided to explore other fields. Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge.""Speaker 1: Do you like your current job?""Speaker 2: Well, All tight. But you know, Smoking does do harm to your health.""Speaker 1: Yes, You are right.""Speaker 2: Why don't you try and give it up?""Speaker 2: Oh, So you're a frat boy now, Huh?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Yeah, I know, It's totally cliche, But really, I think it's been a good decision. I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys. What about you? What have you been up to?""Speaker 2: Not much. I'm still living at home and commuting to school. I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.""Speaker 1: That sounds smart... But kind of boring.""Speaker 2: Yeah, It is, A little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors Club, Though, Which has been a lot of fun. We've gone on two camping trips already, And I've made some good friends.""Speaker 1: That's cool. Hey, So have you decided on your major yet?""Speaker 2: Definitely pre-med. What about you?""Speaker 1: I still have no clue... But we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year, So I've got time! Oops, I'm late for class. Gotta run!""Speaker 2: Ok, Take care! Hey, Nice running into you!""Speaker 2: Any reasons?""Speaker 1: The cause is another boy.""Speaker 2: Yes. I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa.""Speaker 1: Do you know where the visa office is?""Speaker 2: No.""Speaker 2: You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries, And yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong!""Speaker 1: I am not wrong! The chicken came first!""Speaker 2: Ok, I'm going to stay up awhile. I'Ve got to go over the household budget, We ‘re a little over-spend this month.""Speaker 1: Please told Tim to close the door to the basement. I don't want dog down there tonight.""Speaker 2: Typical Francis, Whether you are at work, Or engaged in leisure time activities, You always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself.""Speaker 2: Oh, He wants to practice his language skills, Too.""Speaker 1: That's right. And it's a B that I'll be writing too. Her name is Olga.""Speaker 2: Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English.""Speaker 1: That's a great idea! Why didn't I think of that?""Speaker 2: That's too bad.""Speaker 1: Then my son drove into a tree.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear that.""Speaker 1: The dog bit the delivery boy.""Speaker 2: What a pity!""Speaker 1: And a storm blew our roof away.""Speaker 2: Why are you going there?""Speaker 1: I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday. I want to exchange some Japanese yen.""Speaker 2: I see. Will you bring a lot of money with you?""Speaker 1: Not really. I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan.""Speaker 2: Do you have the bank card in Japan?""Speaker 1: Nope. You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries.""Speaker 2: That sounds really convenient. Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service?""Speaker 1: No. It is free of charge.""Speaker 2: Great! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later.""Speaker 2: I know that. I mean I couldn't understand her at all.""Speaker 1: Me neither. All I have to do is study French hard.""Speaker 2: Why? You mean a lot to me.""Speaker 1: Why didn't you answer my question?""Speaker 2: What question?""Speaker 1: Do you love me? Come on, I'm eager to hear.""Speaker 2: You know that I care for you. I---I'm proud of you.""Speaker 1: Don't cherish your words, Dear.""Speaker 2: I like playing basketball. Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball.""Speaker 1: Who is your favorite author?""Speaker 2: I like the novels of Dickens very much. I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation.""Speaker 1: Are you a music lover?""Speaker 2: Yes, I like listening to Beethoven's works.""Speaker 1: What kinds of films do you enjoy?""Speaker 2: I usually read or entertain myself.""Speaker 1: What kind of books are you interested in?""Speaker 2: My favorite books are those about detectives.""Speaker 1: Well, Those books are really good. I like them too. How do you entertain yourself?""Speaker 2: That's a hard time. The air is cold and damp, And the road is often icy.""Speaker 1: It's boring, Right?""Speaker 2: Sure.""Speaker 1: Do you get much rain during the summer?""Speaker 2: Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area.""Speaker 1: So you should bring an umbrella often.""Speaker 2: That's not a very good pick. I'm against the Yankees.""Speaker 1: Hey, Ken. Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox.""Speaker 2: In other words, The Romans do what everyone else does.""Speaker 1: Yes, But they do it differently. Everything is different.""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: Well, The climate's different for a start. It doesn't rain so much as it does in England. The sun shines more often.""Speaker 2: I envy them the sun.""Speaker 1: I know. You hate the rain, Don't you?""Speaker 2: I certainly do.""Speaker 1: And a Roman really Ioves life. Eye knows how to enjoy himself.""Speaker 2: They always eat spaghetti and drink wine, Don't they?""Speaker 1: Not always. But they like a good meal. Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food, You know.""Speaker 2: Really? How much does it cost to fly to Rome?""Speaker 2: No problem. What should I bring?""Speaker 2: Do you know anyone in the play?""Speaker 1: Actually, The woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine.""Speaker 2: Really? Is that why you wanted to come to the play?""Speaker 1: That's only part of it. I absolutely adore this director. Every play he works on turns out great.""Speaker 2: So you've seen other plays that he's directed?""Speaker 1: Quite a few actually. By the way, After the play, There's always a big party for the cast and their friends. My friend has invited us. Do you want to go?""Speaker 2: Sure, I'd love to meet the cast! Have you ever been in a play?""Speaker 1: I've never had a part in a play before, But I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school.""Speaker 2: What did you do?""Speaker 1: I helped build the sets and find props for the plays. What about you?""Speaker 2: I once helped out with costumes, But I didn't enjoy it very much.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat.""Speaker 2: C'mon, Yi-jun. It's lots of fun. You've seen football played on TV.""Speaker 1: Uh, Yeah. And I've seen guys in pads tackled. We have no pads. I don't want to be tackled.""Speaker 2: There's barely any contact in touch football. People just tag you to stop the play.""Speaker 2: I was caught in the heavy rain, Or I would have come earlier. I am sorry I kept you waiting.""Speaker 1: I was in a comfortable place, So really, It's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long?""Speaker 2: Yes. When I came out of the subway, It was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up.""Speaker 2: Public schools are usually state funded, Whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere.""Speaker 1: Which is better?""Speaker 2: One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers.""Speaker 1: I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school.""Speaker 2: Career path? I'm not sure.""Speaker 1: What kind of job do you want after graduation?""Speaker 2: I want to become a professor, A lawyer, An editor, A civil servant...""Speaker 1: Wait! You can't do so many things at the same time. What exactly do you want?""Speaker 2: I don't know. Do you have any advice for me?""Speaker 1: Yeah, You should first decide what kind of career you really want, Plan your career path, And then try your best to achieve your goal.""Speaker 2: I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career.""Speaker 1: No, You can't waste your time wandering around. If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma, You should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working.""Speaker 2: Maybe. I'm not sure why they have fashion shows like this. Hardly anyone will buy those clothes. The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear. It seems like a waste of money.""Speaker 1: I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons. First, It's just like a big party. They can meet each other and network. The other thing is that it is great advertising. All the journalists and photographers are there. Thirdly, It give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing.""Speaker 2: You meant it's an expression of their fantasies?""Speaker 1: Yes. I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren't concerned with what other people might think. In a way, The designers are saying ‘ don't worry about what others think. Wear what you like! '.""Speaker 2: Very philosophical. I think they design these clothes more for publicity. They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous, But still stylish.""Speaker 2: Congratulations. How lucky you are!""Speaker 1: Thank you. I'm leaving tomorrow morning.""Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll enjoy the trip. China is such a beautiful country.""Speaker 1: I'm sure I will.""Speaker 2: Have a nice journey, Lily.""Speaker 2: I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum.""Speaker 1: Look at the ticket booth in the center. There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be.""Speaker 2: Yeah. We are lucky. Let's go buy the tickets first. We can have breakfast later. I am so hungry.""Speaker 1: Good idea.""Speaker 2: ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to?""Speaker 1: I have no idea. Let me take a closer look at my museum map.""Speaker 2: Sure, Take your time. We have a whole day.""Speaker 1: It's on the 2nd floor.

I hope we will do much better under her guidance.""Speaker 2: You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before. You can buy sweets and chocolates, Newspapers, Birthday and Christmas cards...""Speaker 1: Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits, Like unemployment benefit and child support benefit. The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment.""Speaker 2: My son likes going to the main post office. They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection.""Speaker 1: Do you think that the service at post offices has improved?""Speaker 2: I think it's better for some things, Like sending and receiving money, But if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to.""Speaker 2: She has nothing that deserves my jealousy. I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty. Don't you think so?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Right. But what did you put on your face last night? Those little greenish things.""Speaker 2: They are cucumbers. They are natural skin soothers, Natural healers of the skin. Haven't you heard them say on TV that... Eh... They soften the skin, Wipe out the roughness, Counter irritation and build strength and resilience?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! They wipe out tight, Tired feelings and remove lines and age signs. Blah, Blah... See, I can even recite it.""Speaker 2: But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river.""Speaker 1: You cannot judge a person that way. I have a hunch that he is a sly dog.""Speaker 2: Depends on with whom. He may be doing things on the sly, But he is honest with me. I trust him.""Speaker 2: Huh? Um... Well, It's nice to see that some people still have big families.""Speaker 2: Your feelings might be right. You should never walk alone there at night. It is too dangerous.""Speaker 2: At what time?""Speaker 1: My last appointment is at 3, So I should be free by 5 at the very latest. I think I could get to the airport by 6.""Speaker 2: Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5?""Speaker 1: No, Not really.""Speaker 2: So you are not sure how long it will take to get there?""Speaker 1: No, But I am sure it won't take more than an hour.""Speaker 2: Don't forget it's Friday nighty. If Frankfurt's anything like London, Everybody will be leaving for the weekend. It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly.""Speaker 1: You are a pessimist.""Speaker 2: Ok. That means you can park in the student lot or on the street. Have you seen the handicapped spots?""Speaker 1: I am not sure what a handicapped spot is.""Speaker 2: Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces. Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening?""Speaker 1: I park days and evenings.""Speaker 2: Be careful about the time limits on the streets. Have you seen the signs for time limits?""Speaker 1: What signs?""Speaker 2: As long as you are careful reading the signs, You will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there. Are you aware of the curb colors?""Speaker 1: What curb colors?""Speaker 2: That's great! When will we go?""Speaker 1: Borrow morning.""Speaker 2: All right.

It's been a long time.""Speaker 1: How is everything?""Speaker 2: Just fine, And you?""Speaker 1: Quite well, Thank you.""Speaker 2: Did you drive yourself to the airport?""Speaker 1: No, I was driven by my husband.""Speaker 2: Did someone meet you at the airport here?""Speaker 1: Yes, Thanks.""Speaker 2: Is this where we'll be holding the meeting?""Speaker 2: Yes, It's really so beautiful with all the things covered by snow.""Speaker 1: By the way, Where can I go ski?""Speaker 2: Really good! You should try it sometime.""Speaker 1: I might. What did you do yesterday?""Speaker 2: Yes. Do you know its name.""Speaker 1: She said she would name it after her father.""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 2: Thank you.""Speaker 1: How do you think of the weather today?""Speaker 2: He's much better today.""Speaker 1: I'm glad to hear that. Bye.""Speaker 2: That is the best one I have seen. I am sure our target customers, Young people will love it.""Speaker 2: Oh, Does he play the piano?""Speaker 1: No, He doesn't!!!

You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday.""Speaker 1: I feel much better, But I'm still worried about something.""Speaker 2: What's that?""Speaker 1: Well, I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning, And I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic.""Speaker 2: That's annoying, But nothing to worry about.""Speaker 1: For me, Traffic jams are quite stressful, Because I'm pretty impatient. How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam?""Speaker 2: Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset.""Speaker 1: Ok, I'll try that.""Speaker 2: Is there anything else bothering you?""Speaker 1: Just one more thing. A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do.""Speaker 2: Do you have any other plans this weekend?""Speaker 1: I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday.""Speaker 2: Try not to take on more than you can handle.""Speaker 2: Yes, I went to the New Year's Concert in 2010.""Speaker 1: Wow, You're so lucky. I saw it on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall.""Speaker 2: He said that I put all other girls in the shade.""Speaker 1: That means he was head over heels in love with you.""Speaker 2: Well, He indeed likes me.""Speaker 1: But I think he can't hold a candle to you. I don't think he has ever popped the question.""Speaker 2: Ok. Here's my passport.""Speaker 1: What's the expiration date on your passport?""Speaker 2: I think it's soon, Maybe in a few months. It was renewed in Beijing, So the new expiry date is on the last page.""Speaker 1: I see. Yes, You'll need to renew your passport in a few months. Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK.""Speaker 2: I won't.""Speaker 1: Do you have anything to declare?""Speaker 2: No, I don't have anything to declare.""Speaker 1: How long will you be staying in the UK?""Speaker 2: I'll be here for about a year.""Speaker 1: What is the purpose of your stay?""Speaker 2: I'll be studying. I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University.""Speaker 1: Where will you be staying?""Speaker 2: I have a housing contract with the university. I'll be in a dorm room on campus.""Speaker 1: How do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here?""Speaker 2: My father has already paid for that in advance. Here are the receipts.""Speaker 1: Ok. Have a good day. Here's your passport and documents back.""Speaker 2: No, Really. Look. It's got a double time zone setting.""Speaker 1: So you can always keep two times at once?""Speaker 2: Yep. I just can't decide what two cities to choose...""Speaker 2: Any other requirements?""Speaker 1: Phrases and sentence patterns are also very important. You should know how to use them.""Speaker 2: Should we remember all the new words and expressions?""Speaker 1: Certainly.""Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit. I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems.""Speaker 1: Well. When you review your lessons, Mark the places which you don't understand, Then I will give you some coaching.""Speaker 2: When shall we have a coaching period?""Speaker 1: How about tomorrow?""Speaker 2: Stop producing cigarettes.""Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.""Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.""Speaker 1: How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet?""Speaker 2: The author was a famous writer, And he was also a politician. He was born in 1911 and died in 1985.""Speaker 1: Very good. Sit down, Please. Susan, What's the general idea of the text?""Speaker 2: Can I answer it in Chinese?""Speaker 1: No, You can't. This is an English class, And you have to express yourself in English.""Speaker 2: Let me have a try. The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities. They are quiet, Shy and reserved...""Speaker 2: Great minds think alike. My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time. Do you have anything on your schedule?""Speaker 1: Nothing particular.""Speaker 2: Why don't you join us? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare.""Speaker 1: Oh, Tibet sounds great, But I'm afraid it'll cost too much. Last time I traveled to India, And it cost me a fortune.""Speaker 2: Come on! We're traveling on our own. It won't cost too much.""Speaker 1: Ok, Then count me in. Where will we stay?""Speaker 2: The youth hotels are comfortable and cheap.""Speaker 1: Then make sure that you book me a room, Too.""Speaker 2: I'll take care of it.""Speaker 1: And check whether they accept credit cards.""Speaker 2: A driver's license or something showing that you live in this city.""Speaker 1: I'm a student from out of state, So I don't have a local driver's license.""Speaker 2: Do you have a current electricity or gas bill in your name?""Speaker 1: The phone bill's in my name.""Speaker 2: That'll do. Bring the most recent one in with your completed application, And we'll issue you a temporary library card right away.""Speaker 1: How long will it take to get the regular one?""Speaker 2: It'll be mailed to you within two weeks, But you can borrow books on the temporary card.""Speaker 2: I did.""Speaker 1: Wow!""Speaker 2: It was no big deal.""Speaker 1: What do your parents think of your dating a boy?""Speaker 2: They're glad that I finally got a boyfriend.""Speaker 2: This is a small town, And we like to be neighborly. We know everyone who lives around here.""Speaker 1: Well, I'm from Chicago. There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors.""Speaker 2: So, Tell me, Karl, Hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live?""Speaker 2: Just don't come looking to me for help.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. I won't.""Speaker 2: I'm signing off.""Speaker 2: Because I want to study English literature. But I think chemistry is better for getting a job.""Speaker 1: Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college. Have you decide what you are going to do when you graduated?""Speaker 2: Oh, No. Most of the time I do these things. She is a writer.""Speaker 2: You mean my favorite movie of all time? I guess I'd have to say pretty woman.""Speaker 2: Alecia.""Speaker 1: Have you tried these littleditties? They are really good.""Speaker 2: Thanks. They look delicious.""Speaker 1: Can I get you some punch? I was just going to go get myself some.""Speaker 2: Well done. You got them all. You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score. I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well.""Speaker 1: Good start. You knocked eight pins down. But you are left with a 7, 10 split. Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl, It is going to be impossible.""Speaker 1: But i do not like anyone touch my head.""Speaker 2: They are just been in friendly, When you are in Roman, Do as the Romans do, That means you need to adapt to your enviroment.""Speaker 1: What if everybody in the wheres goes crazy?""Speaker 2: Then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy.""Speaker 1: Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches, I am supposed to wonder run reget?""Speaker 2: Do you think it is a ~ got give your brain, Use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head, Keep distance from them, Why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you.""Speaker 2: Yes, It is. You want go online? There are no wi-fi hotspots around.""Speaker 1: Oh my, No internet access is killing me.""Speaker 2: Can't you wait till you get home? Then you can surf the internet using the broadband, Wireless connection or whatever you like.""Speaker 1: No, I'm not feeling myself. I just want to check my emails, Visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends.""Speaker 2: Now I see, You must be suffering from discomgoogolation.""Speaker 1: What does that mean? There's nothing wrong with me.""Speaker 2: Well, The term \"discomgoogolation\" comes from \"discombobulate\" and \"google\". Because floods of information are just a mouse click away, Net users are very likely to become addicted to the web.""Speaker 1: That's alright. I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information. It almost drives me crazy.""Speaker 2: Right now, I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes.""Speaker 1: That sounds really interesting. Can you speak Swahili?""Speaker 2: Yes, I learned how to speak it when I was little.""Speaker 1: Really? How did you do that?""Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in Africa, So I learned quite a few different languages.""Speaker 1: That's amazing. Are you doing well in your classes?""Speaker 2: I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet.""Speaker 1: When did you take your exams?""Speaker 2: About two weeks ago.""Speaker 1: How do you think you did?""Speaker 2: I left feeling pretty confident about my score, But I heard that my professors are very strict graders, So I'm a bit nervous.""Speaker 1: I'm sure you'll do well. Did you study hard?""Speaker 2: You know me ; I'm always studying!""Speaker 1: Don't worry. If you don't do well, No one can!""Speaker 2: Really? How could you do that? Don't you save every couple minutes?""Speaker 1: No, I didn't save this time. Damn it! And I'm sick of writing this paper. Now I have to write it all over again too.""Speaker 2: I've had that problem too many times. So I learned to save. When I'm writing something, I save every three sentences or so. I don't want to lose anything.""Speaker 1: I hate computers. Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth.""Speaker 2: What are we going to do now?""Speaker 1: I don't know. I feel like going out.""Speaker 2: I wonder how much of the city is down.""Speaker 1: It doesn't matter. I still can go out and buy a beer.""Speaker 2: Maybe. But if there's a blackout, Probably the pubs are closed. And besides, I know you have a political science exam tomorrow. I thought you had a lot of reading to do.""Speaker 1: Yes, That's true. Damn! I just lost half my paper, And now I can't even do my homework. This is a bad time for this to happen.""Speaker 2: I shall. I wasn't as careless as John Sampson. He walked across that wet cement over there.""Speaker 1: The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a notice.""Speaker 2: The headmaster asked them not to do so.""Speaker 1: Then why isn't there a notice?""Speaker 2: They went to their stores to get one. Here they come with it now!""Speaker 2: Not really. After a 12 - hour flight, I've got jetlag, And on top of that, I think I've also got the flu.""Speaker 1: Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now.""Speaker 2: Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?""Speaker 1: You're really hot. Let me get you someTylenol to bring the fever down.""Speaker 2: Ok. I'll stay home this morning and rest, But if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting.""Speaker 1: Zach, What's that on your arm?""Speaker 2: I don't know. It looks a bit red, But I'm sure it's nothing.""Speaker 1: It looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything?""Speaker 2: Just cats, But I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks.""Speaker 1: I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no. We'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine. Let's go.""Speaker 2: Shouldn't we make an appointment first?""Speaker 1: We would, But let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse.""Speaker 2: Boston University.""Speaker 1: That's a good school. What do you study?""Speaker 2: I'm studying English, Math, And history. My major is English.""Speaker 1: How long have you been studying English?""Speaker 2: More than six years.""Speaker 1: That's a long time.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I started to learn English when I was in high school.""Speaker 1: No wonder your English is so good.""Speaker 2: Actually, It's not that good. I can read but I can't speak very well. I haven't had a lot of chance to practice.""Speaker 1: I see. Talking with other people is very important.""Speaker 2: Yes, But I still don't have many friends here yet.""Speaker 1: I'm having a party tonight at my apartment. You should come.""Speaker 2: No way. I will be scared out of my wits.""Speaker 1: That's funny, I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside.""Speaker 2: Hey, How would you like to taste my fist?""Speaker 1: Alright, All joking aside, What kinds of moves do you like?""Speaker 2: Um, Let me see, Romance, Comedy. Documentary, Action, Science fiction, Animated and so on.""Speaker 1: That is to say, You like all genres except for horror movies.""Speaker 2: Yeah. It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned.""Speaker 1: Not quite. I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy.""Speaker 2: The Notebook is this type of movie.""Speaker 1: Really? I haven't heard of it.""Speaker 2: Well then, This could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together. I bet you'd love it.""Speaker 2: Did you notice the characters on the lanterns?""Speaker 1: Sure. But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters. What do they say?""Speaker 2: They are puzzles. It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival.""Speaker 1: Very interesting. But I'm afraid we'd better do something else. Hey, Look! There is a huge lantern there. Let's get close to it.""Speaker 2: It's really eye-catching. It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life.""Speaker 1: Really? Then I'm really lucky. Oh, It's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth.""Speaker 2: Very impressive. It's made of glass which makes it even brighter.""Speaker 1: There are many Chinese characters on its body, Too. What are they about? Puzzles?""Speaker 2: I opened my blog today. In order to have more visitors, I have to land on others 'blogs and leave my messages for their blogs.""Speaker 1: What's new with you?""Speaker 2: Do you still remember Justin?""Speaker 1: Of course, He was our monitor in college. How is him now?""Speaker 2: He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend. I found his blogs were a little sad.""Speaker 2: But your company is huge. Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages.""Speaker 1: But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company, So new employees get quite low salary, No matter how excellent they have done.""Speaker 2: That's shortsighted. By the time the workers are experienced and contributing. They are likely to go.""Speaker 1: That's why I am going to leave.""Speaker 2: But you have already worked there for five years.""Speaker 1: I am worried about my future. I can't believe that our company is as big as it is. The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff.""Speaker 2: Well. The management doesn't seem to think that way. Anyways, You have to think twice before you act.""Speaker 2: Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, He's got Richard's eyes though.""Speaker 1: Yes, He does have Richard's eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.""Speaker 2: Well, Children usually resemble their parents.""Speaker 1: It's true. Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways. And she is shy with new people just like he is.""Speaker 2: You often like comparing children with their parents.""Speaker 2: Hello, This is Mark speaking.""Speaker 1: Hi! This is Jill. How come you didn't come in today?""Speaker 2: Oh, We had a birthday party for David last night. As a matter of fact I woke up with a terrible hangover.""Speaker 1: That's too bad. You'll have to be more careful nest time.""Speaker 2: Anything new at the office?""Speaker 1: No, Nothing special. Oh, Yes, You know Bill, The guy with themoustache. His wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today, He said his wife and daughter are doing fine. The baby is their first child.""Speaker 2: That's wonderful! We've got to celebrate!""Speaker 1: Yes, We have to. Do you think you can make it tomorrow?""Speaker 2: Sure. I ought to be ready for some more drinks by then. Thank you for calling.""Speaker 2: I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.""Speaker 1: Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.""Speaker 2: Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.""Speaker 1: Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.""Speaker 2: I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brain power.""Speaker 1: You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, But dance might make you livelier and happier.""Speaker 2: Where did you buy it?""Speaker 1: I bought it in a store near my school.""Speaker 2: How much is it?""Speaker 1: It's only thirty yuan.""Speaker 2: It's so cheap. I'll buy one, Too.""Speaker 2: Well, You're in luck! You see, If you sign up for our three-year plan, We'll throw in a handset for free.""Speaker 1: Really?

Oh, And we also offer a rollover option.""Speaker 1: Wow, All this for forty dollars per month?""Speaker 2: Could you make it up by attending my other section this week?""Speaker 1: Yes, It's all taken care of.""Speaker 2: Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes?""Speaker 1: I can stay a few more minutes.""Speaker 2: Ok, But please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed.""Speaker 1: Thanks, Professor. I've got it covered!""Speaker 2: I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years. People don't change fashions every year. It would be too expensive.""Speaker 1: Yes. Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year, But only rich people can do it.""Speaker 2: There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes.""Speaker 1: I wish I could be one of those people, But my budget simply doesn't stretch that far. I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy.""Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry I forgot all about it. Well, Can I take a rain check?""Speaker 1: What's the matter with you? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there.""Speaker 2: Let me see them. Are these all the notes you have?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: But Laurie, How can you do well in school if you don't take more notes?""Speaker 1: What do you mean? You think I don't write enough.""Speaker 2: I'm sure you don't write enough. Look at this. Here you wrote, Russian Revolution. 1917. Bolsheviks. Real revolution, Or coup? And that's all? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question. And you didn't write any of it!""Speaker 1: I know, But I listened.""Speaker 2: Yes, But did you remember? You need good notes to help you remember.""Speaker 1: I suppose you're right. But what can I do? I don't know what to write down.""Speaker 2: There are different things you can do. For one, The university offers a special free course on note-taking. You should go to the course. Also, I am pretty good at taking notes. I can help you on this exam. I will photocopy all my notes, And you can compare them to your notes. Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down.""Speaker 1: That would really help me, Sue. I appreciate it. All this makes me feel like an idiot.""Speaker 2: Don't feel that way. I know you are very smart. Note - taking is a special skill. All students need to learn it. Some people are very smart, But they just haven't learned how to take notes yet. I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school. She taught me how to take good notes. It's not hard.""Speaker 2: That's in one month, And besides, This is a group date with all of our friends.""Speaker 1: All of your friends, What are you planning to do?""Speaker 2: We're going fishing.""Speaker 1: What a party! I hope you don't expect the girls to fish.""Speaker 2: What color are her eyes?""Speaker 1: They're blue.""Speaker 2: What color is her hair?""Speaker 1: It's brown.""Speaker 2: How old is she?""Speaker 2: Yeah, It's weird. For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely, Even though there was really no reason to feel that way.""Speaker 1: Well, Maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, Brave and hopeful!""Speaker 2: Oh, That's a nice one of all of you together. Do you have the negative? May I have a copy?""Speaker 1: Surely, I'll have one made for you. You want a print?""Speaker 2: No. I'd like a slide, I have a new projector.""Speaker 1: I'd like to see that myself.""Speaker 2: Have a wallet size print made for me, Too.""Speaker 2: It gives me great satisfaction.""Speaker 1: Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work.""Speaker 2: Yes, I'd like some coffee.""Speaker 1: Sorry, I don't have any coffee.""Speaker 2: That's OK. I'll have a glass of water.""Speaker 1: A small glass, Or a big one?""Speaker 2: Small please.""Speaker 1: Here you are.""Speaker 2: Thanks.""Speaker 2: Of course! Everyday, There is a deadline to meet. Bosses watching and testing me all the time, Not liking in college, Handed in paper months later and tested on schedule. It is so busy. But anyway, I have trying my best to be a good employee.""Speaker 1: Well, You'Ve adapted yourself very well. Everyone in our office thinks you'Ve made a great progress in the past two years. What is your secret?""Speaker 2: Don't you want to hear more about my statue?""Speaker 1: Don't get ahead of yourself. Fat boy isn't yours yet.""Speaker 2: A light brown suit and a pink tie today, And a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday. A perfect match!""Speaker 1: The tie is necessary for man. It makes you look so attractive in a super tie.""Speaker 2: Match is important ; well, The way of tying is also important.""Speaker 1: My father dose not know how to tie a tie, For he often wears a cravat.""Speaker 2: My father wears a tie every day, But he can't do it himself. My mother helps him with his tie every morning.""Speaker 2: Really? In New Berlin?""Speaker 1: No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a \"tornado watch.\" That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.""Speaker 2: I understand. They think a tornado might come.""Speaker 1: Yes. People should look out, Because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a \"watch.\".""Speaker 2: And the second stage is called a \"tornado warning\".""Speaker 1: Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, They announce a \"tornado warning\". So if there's a tornado warning on, It means a tornado is out there somewhere.""Speaker 2: It's scary.""Speaker 1: Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, It's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, Then we have to go in the basement.""Speaker 2: What do you mean \"a loud train\"?""Speaker 1: That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.""Speaker 2: But if you hear them coming, Isn't it already too late?""Speaker 1: Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.""Speaker 2: Have you seen a lot of them?""Speaker 1: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.""Speaker 2: Did it hit their house?""Speaker 1: No, It didn't. But they are glad I called them.""Speaker 2: What were they doing when you called?""Speaker 1: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, They could have all been killed.""Speaker 2: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?""Speaker 2: No, But Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today. My mailbox must have been overflowing.""Speaker 1: How obnoxious! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes.""Speaker 2: Don't be so irritable. I just don't understand the program, That's all.""Speaker 1: All right, I will explain it to you later on. Now scram.""Speaker 2: Ok. I will wait until you have had your fun, If that's what you want.""Speaker 2: If I get the promotion, I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer.""Speaker 1: Will you get a pay-raise, Too?""Speaker 2: Whenever you are given added responsibilities, You should get a promotion.""Speaker 1: That makes sense. Who interviewed you?""Speaker 2: My boss.""Speaker 1: What kinds of questions did she ask you?""Speaker 2: She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be.""Speaker 1: The second one sounds rather difficult to answer. What did you tell her?""Speaker 2: I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally.""Speaker 1: Those are good answers. How did she react?""Speaker 2: She told me that even when I become a senior engineer, I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team.""Speaker 1: What do you think about her as a boss?""Speaker 2: She's pretty easy to get along with. She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally.""Speaker 1: You're lucky. Not everyone has such a great boss!""Speaker 2: That's true. She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company.""Speaker 1: When you find out you get the promotion or not, Let me know.""Speaker 2: Yes, I know, Sir. I'm sorry.""Speaker 1: Well, What's your excuse then?""Speaker 2: My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yes?""Speaker 2: What day will you need it for?""Speaker 1: We will only be needing it for Sunday.""Speaker 2: Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it.""Speaker 1: The only two drivers will be Mary and I.""Speaker 2: If I give you the keys to the garage, Could you bring it back on Sunday evening?""Speaker 1: Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be OK?""Speaker 2: Sure. I didn't know you liked mysteries.""Speaker 2: Wait a second. He shoots, He scores!""Speaker 1: All right!""Speaker 2: Here comes Jordan, Though.""Speaker 1: Wow, Michael Jordan's slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch.""Speaker 2: Yeah. He's older, So he doesn't slam, As much as he did when he was younger, But when he does, It's still amazing.""Speaker 1: Which team do you think will win?""Speaker 2: What's the color of her eyes?""Speaker 1: Dark blue.""Speaker 2: How old is she?""Speaker 2: No. It's no problem. Are you American?""Speaker 1: Yes. And you?""Speaker 2: No. I'm from Taiwan. Can't you see?""Speaker 1: Well, There are many Chinese Americans, You know. And your English is very good. You sound like an American.""Speaker 2: I don't think so. You are flattering me.""Speaker 1: No, Really. I can only hear a little accent.""Speaker 2: Are you flying home?""Speaker 1: Well, Yes. Actually, I'm going back to visit.""Speaker 2: You were visiting Taiwan?""Speaker 1: No, I'm going back to America to visit. I'm from America, But I don't live there now. I live in Taichung.""Speaker 2: Really! You live in Taiwan!""Speaker 1: Yes. Why not?""Speaker 2: May I ask what your job is in Taiwan?""Speaker 1: Sure. I teach history in a university. Have you heard of Dong-Hai University?""Speaker 2: Of course. It's a good school. How long have you lived in Taichung?""Speaker 1: I have lived in Taichung for two years now. So this is the second time I am going back to states. I go back once a year to visit my family.""Speaker 2: It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan.""Speaker 1: No, It isn't strange at all. Many people from Taiwan move to America too, You know. Do you think it is strange for them?""Speaker 2: I started school somewhere else.""Speaker 1: What school did you transfer from?""Speaker 2: I started at PCC.""Speaker 1: What made you transfer?""Speaker 2: My grades weren't good enough to go here.""Speaker 1: Did you like PCC?""Speaker 2: I loved PCC.""Speaker 1: Good luck here.""Speaker 2: Of course. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer...""Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.""Speaker 2: You're dancing so well.""Speaker 1: You dance beautifully too.""Speaker 2: When did you learn to dance?""Speaker 1: In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?""Speaker 2: We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March.""Speaker 1: How do you celebrate it?""Speaker 2: We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them. We'll also go to church and pray.""Speaker 2: You did give me a surprise. How have you been?""Speaker 1: Fine, Just fine. And you?""Speaker 2: Not so well. I've come down with the flu.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that. Take care of yourself.""Speaker 2: It's really great to see you again. How about a drink tonight?""Speaker 1: Sounds wonderful. When shall we make it?""Speaker 2: How about seven?""Speaker 1: Ok.""Speaker 2: I'll pick you up.""Speaker 2: Yeah, And most importantly, She's single! Man, I could tell from the moment I saw her, She's the girl of my dreams!""Speaker 1: So I take it you two are hitting it off? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor, But what if you break up?""Speaker 2: I don't know. I am not really worried about that. I don't wanna lose before even starting. Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her.""Speaker 1: Sounds like you've got some competition. You made a move already?""Speaker 2: Not yet. But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime. I know some good restaurants nearby.""Speaker 1: That's nice. Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage, Eh?""Speaker 2: You bet. Now that you mentioned it, I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight.""Speaker 1: Good luck!""Speaker 2: Yes, I had my first lesson this morning. Are you a new student too?""Speaker 1: No, I've been here for six months.""Speaker 2: Six months. That's a long time.""Speaker 1: It's not so long really. What class are you in? Intermediate or...?""Speaker 2: Intermediate Three. And what about you?""Speaker 1: I'm in Advanced One. Who's your teacher?""Speaker 2: I can't remember her name, But she's got curly red hair.""Speaker 1: Ah! Does she wear glasses?""Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.""Speaker 1: That's probably Anne Wallis.""Speaker 2: Yes that's right. Do you know her? Is she your teacher too?""Speaker 1: No. But she taught me last term. How long have you been here?""Speaker 2: Only a week.""Speaker 1: Wow, Not long. Where do you live? With a family?""Speaker 2: Well, I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment. I'm looking for somewhere more permanent. Do you know of any good places?""Speaker 1: Yes. Actually my friend has a spare room in here apartment and she's looking for a flatmate. Would you like her phone number?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: Well, The editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.""Speaker 2: Really? That's fantastic! Will you get a chance to do any writing?""Speaker 1: She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back.""Speaker 2: Wow! That's really great news. How often does the magazine come out?""Speaker 1: It's a monthly magazine, But my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly.""Speaker 2: Are you looking forward to doing more editing work?""Speaker 1: Yes, But I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again!""Speaker 2: Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine?""Speaker 1: I don't have any with me, But I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you.""Speaker 2: I'm really looking forward to reading your column.""Speaker 1: Me, Too. Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news?""Speaker 2: Sure, Where would you like to go?""Speaker 2: Maybe...""Speaker 1: Some of my grappa will cure your shyness.""Speaker 2: Is that a kind of alcohol?""Speaker 1: It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day. You will love it!""Speaker 2: How about As long as You Love Me! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke!""Speaker 2: Ok. No problem.""Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, I haven't danced for a long time.""Speaker 2: But it's said that you dance wonderfully well.""Speaker 1: Thanks for flattering me. I think you dance a lot, Right?""Speaker 2: No. Just occasionally.""Speaker 1: What are your favourite dances?""Speaker 2: I love rumba and waltz.""Speaker 1: How aboutsamba?""Speaker 2: To tell the truth, I don't like it. It's too fast.""Speaker 1: Then I'll see you at six. Is that all right?""Speaker 2: Ok. See you then.""Speaker 2: Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours. Which films do you think will win awards this year?""Speaker 1: I'm really not sure. Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony, But this year there are several contenders.""Speaker 2: You're right. This year should be much more exciting than usual. What's you favourite award category?""Speaker 1: You might think this strange, But I like the category for “ best foreign language film \".""Speaker 2: They're really running you into the ground. Why don't you ask for some time off? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere.""Speaker 1: You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account! Me! I'Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime!""Speaker 2: Wow! Why so much? I thought they were getting you an assistant.""Speaker 1: They were supposed to, But so far nobody's turned up, And I'm left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I'Ve had all day.""Speaker 2: They're really running you into the ground. Why don't you ask for some time off? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere.""Speaker 1: You won't believe who's been elected to do overtime on the Baker account! Me! I'Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime!""Speaker 2: Wow! Why so much? I thought they were getting you an assistant.""Speaker 1: They were supposed to, But so far nobody's turned up, And I'm left on my own to do the work. This is the first break I'Ve had all day.""Speaker 2: Maybe it is. But it's out of fashion.""Speaker 1: What am I going to do?""Speaker 2: I'd like to. But I'm afraid I can't.""Speaker 1: I was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then.""Speaker 2: That sounds great.""Speaker 1: Ok. How about give me a ring, Then?""Speaker 2: No. I'd better not.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: You've gone bonkers, Jen.""Speaker 1: It's facial paper, And it fits into the rings of my binder! It's magical.""Speaker 2: How about I come and see you off?""Speaker 1: You really don't need to.""Speaker 2: Ok. I'll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon.""Speaker 1: I hope so, Too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything.""Speaker 2: You're welcome.""Speaker 1: Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me.""Speaker 2: Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey.""Speaker 1: Thank you. Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington.""Speaker 2: Of course. I will.""Speaker 2: Oh, I don't think he wants to.

Good idea!""Speaker 2: How do you want to spend your old age?""Speaker 2: With everything, With everybody, With all this!""Speaker 1: A good suggestion for you. You need a holiday.""Speaker 2: It wasn't always like this, You know.""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: Well, I mean. We always do the same thing. There's no variety in our lives.""Speaker 1: You need a holiday. That's what's the matter.""Speaker 2: Can you sing the song?""Speaker 2: Like renewing my passport, Going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone.""Speaker 1: You are not going to give it up, Are you?""Speaker 2: No way. I'll never find another apartment around here. But I don't like the idea of paying three months 'rent on an empty apartment, Either.""Speaker 1: I don't blame you. Perhaps you could sublet it.""Speaker 2: Yes, But whom to?""Speaker 1: Mmm... Let me think. Oh, I know just a person. An old colleague of mine, Jim Thomas, Is coming here to do some research this summer, From June to August.""Speaker 2: That's exactly when I'll be away. It sounds ideal, As long as the landlord agrees.""Speaker 1: Tell you what, I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway, So I'll mention it to him then.""Speaker 2: Of course you can. ( Lead Carl to his garage. ).""Speaker 1: Wow, This new car is dynamite! It is a shiny, Beautiful car.""Speaker 2: My car is simply a daisy. It drives smoothly.""Speaker 1: The car has very sleek lines. I love it.""Speaker 2: I am glad to hear that. I'm really pleased with it.""Speaker 2: But how can I prevent a deficit?""Speaker 1: I think you should make a thorough market investigation now.""Speaker 2: Ok, Ok. I'll do my best.""Speaker 1: I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up.""Speaker 2: I know life is not all roses, And I believe I will pull this through.""Speaker 2: Thank you.""Speaker 1: And how's your brother?""Speaker 2: He is fine.""Speaker 1: He's going to be sent to Britain to study, Really?""Speaker 2: Yes. He's already got the passport and visa.""Speaker 1: Fantastic! Please send him my congratulations.""Speaker 2: This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their Chinese.""Speaker 1: Will they recommend me the class that suits me?""Speaker 2: Sure. You can review the lessons you have learned at school and learn something new there.""Speaker 2: Not really. But I like it in spring and fall. I don't like it in winter.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day.""Speaker 1: What about the weather in Boston?""Speaker 2: I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter.""Speaker 1: Is it very cold in winter?""Speaker 2: Sorry, It's from the Godfather. It's when the, When the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone, It's just before the horse's head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets, You know, Wakes up, And AAAL! Never mind.""Speaker 1: You were spying on me, Weren't you? You probably rented those children.""Speaker 2: Why would I spy on you?""Speaker 1: Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well, Or you would not put up that sign just around the corner.""Speaker 2: The entrance to our store is around the corner. And there's no other way of saying that. It's not the name of our store. It's where it is. And you do not own the phrase around the corner.""Speaker 1: What is that? What are you doing? You're taking all the caviar! That caviar is a garnish?""Speaker 2: You know on a date, They are going to dinner.""Speaker 1: Dad and mom?""Speaker 2: Yeah, They said they're reviving the old tradition.""Speaker 1: You mean this is going to be a regular thing?""Speaker 2: I am going to register at Harvard next month.""Speaker 1: What are you going to major in?""Speaker 2: I am going to major in tourism.

A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, Though very expensive.""Speaker 2: It will be expensive, But we think it will be worth.""Speaker 2: Ok. ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow! Your house was decorated so beautiful.""Speaker 1: Thank you. My wife would be very happy to hear this.""Speaker 2: She must have done a lot of work on it.""Speaker 2: So how have you been?""Speaker 2: I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday. Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195. 00. I hit the ceiling when I saw that.""Speaker 1: It sounds like you weren't expecting that.""Speaker 2: I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend. He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away.""Speaker 1: Well, If you need some money to tide you over until payday, I can loan you some.""Speaker 2: Yeah but, How did this holiday come to be?""Speaker 1: Well, The first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James. Once in the New World, They befriended an native named Squanto, Who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.""Speaker 2: And then what did happen?""Speaker 1: Well, They had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives, Giving thanks the land, And everyone for the foods, Healthy and new lives.""Speaker 2: Interesting! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are!""Speaker 1: Come to my house for Thanksgiving! We are having turkey, Pumpkin pie, Mashed potatoes with gravy, And lots of stuffing!""Speaker 2: It's a little eerie. I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me.""Speaker 1: Well, I think it's fabulous. And the neighbors don't even seem to exist.""Speaker 2: What's a hall pass?""Speaker 1: Ms. : With a hall pass, You can go to the ladies 'room or wherever you need to go during class time.""Speaker 2: I see.""Speaker 1: Ms. : If a teacher stops you in the hallway, Just show him or her the pass.""Speaker 2: Or else I'll get into trouble.""Speaker 2: Most of the things were household appliance. You know, Everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker. I think it's an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home.""Speaker 1: So, What did you get them?""Speaker 2: I bought a sewing machine. I know that my friend likes making her own clothes, But her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems.""Speaker 1: What's wrong with it?""Speaker 2: She says that after several years of use, It's not working properly. When she uses it, It makes a funny noise.""Speaker 1: Household appliance don't seem to last for a long time nowadays.""Speaker 2: I know, I know. But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes. It's the series finals, And I wouldn't miss it for the world!""Speaker 1: Really? What's the series about?""Speaker 2: Well, It's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America. It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny. I think you'd like it.""Speaker 1: It sounds interesting, But I am not a big fan of TV shows. They're time consuming and don't have much depth.""Speaker 2: I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting. Take this show for example, It examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream, With hilarious results.""Speaker 1: Really? That's interesting!""Speaker 2: Yeah. Oh, Here it comes! Why don't we watch it together? They are going to have a court debate in this episode. It should be good.""Speaker 2: Have you ever written up a business plan before?""Speaker 1: Well, No. It can't be that hard! I mean, All you have to do is explain your business, How you are going to do things and that's it, Right?""Speaker 2: You couldn't be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, History, Etc.""Speaker 1: Well, That seems easy enough.""Speaker 2: Wait, There's more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors'? Then comes the hard part, A market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, Where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.""Speaker 1: Geez. Is that all?""Speaker 2: Almost, The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, Cash flow and profits. After all, People will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!""Speaker 2: I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides.""Speaker 1: What do you usually write about?""Speaker 2: At first, I'll write about my life there. Like interesting things on the campus, Travel stories, Special English words that I come across. Sometimes, I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. How often do you write a blog?""Speaker 2: It's random. If there happen to be a lot of things going on, I may add several new entries in a week, And if I've got nothing to share, I may leave my blog untouched for weeks.""Speaker 1: Got it. Are you still updating your blog?""Speaker 2: Sure, Since I came back from the US, I've been keeping the habit of blogging, Simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like.""Speaker 2: That sounds good.""Speaker 1: What's playing at the Century Fox?""Speaker 2: Candlelight in the Window.""Speaker 1: Should we go see it?""Speaker 2: I'd rather not. I don't like horror movies.""Speaker 1: How about ‘ Run of the Mill? '.""Speaker 2: No. I heard that's really boring.""Speaker 1: Why don't we go to a concert instead?""Speaker 2: I'm from New Orleans. What about you?""Speaker 1: I was born here.""Speaker 2: Really? This is a beautiful town.""Speaker 1: It's nice talking to you. But I have to go.""Speaker 2: Ok. Can I have your phone number?""Speaker 1: Ok. It's 15066688866. Call me! Bye-bye, Then.""Speaker 2: That sounds like a good idea. The sky is clear, The sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze, So it is not too hot.""Speaker 1: I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit, This sure is a nice spring day.""Speaker 2: Hey, This spot in the shade looks really comfortable.""Speaker 1: Okay. Hey, Is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. I say the weather report last night, And it said the weather should be fine all day.""Speaker 2: Just relax. That's because you're new to chat. Let me take a look.""Speaker 1: A /S / L, IGP, H & K, And ZZZ. What the hell do they mean?""Speaker 2: ZzZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ', A /S / L is tricky, Which is often used at first encounter. It's a three-word question,' age, / sex / location? '.""Speaker 1: Interesting. Then what does H & K refer to? The city of Hong Kong?""Speaker 2: Wrong. Lt's not a place name, But a passionate act.""Speaker 1: Really? What kind? A girl left this word to me, And I thought she was in Hong Kong.""Speaker 2: Ahahah... You miss her point for sure. H & K actually is an acronym for 'hug and kiss'.""Speaker 1: Hug and kiss?! How is it possible? Oh, It's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning.""Speaker 2: Let me put it this way. I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down.""Speaker 1: So what did you do about it yesterday?""Speaker 2: I went sky-diving!""Speaker 1: You're kidding me! That sounds really scary!""Speaker 2: It was scary, But it felt great, Too.""Speaker 1: Weren't you scared?""Speaker 2: Of course I was scared. But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped.""Speaker 1: So have you cured your fear of heights?""Speaker 2: I think so. After I jumped out of the plane, I realized that I should just enjoy life. Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly.""Speaker 1: I'm impressed.""Speaker 2: Are you scared of anything?""Speaker 1: Well, Sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself.""Speaker 2: What do you think is going to happen?""Speaker 1: I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things.""Speaker 2: I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation.""Speaker 2: No kidding! When the last CEO left, We were worried about the future of the company.""Speaker 1: What does a CEO do anyway? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company, But what does he actually do?""Speaker 2: He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company. He or she must give leadership to all company officers, As CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company, And acting as official representative, Or face of the company.""Speaker 2: No, Seriously... I really want this.""Speaker 1: I tell ya, When I got the invite, It really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.""Speaker 2: I know. But things have changed. I guess I've settled down.""Speaker 2: I don't remember, But it wasn't very serious. Have you ever been in an earthquake?""Speaker 1: No, But I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger.""Speaker 2: Where are you from?""Speaker 1: I'm from the plains of the Midwest. It's a prime location for tornadoes.""Speaker 2: Did your house ever get damaged from the winds?""Speaker 1: Most of the time we were lucky, But once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room.""Speaker 2: Wow, That must have really been scary.""Speaker 1: Actually, Some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass.""Speaker 2: Have you ever experiences a flood?""Speaker 1: No, But my father's car was destroyed in a flood once. It actually happened the day after he bought the car!""Speaker 2: Really? In New Berlin?""Speaker 1: No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a tornado watch. That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.""Speaker 2: I understand. They think a tornado might come.""Speaker 1: Yes. People should look out, Because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a watch.""Speaker 2: And the second stage is called a tornado warning.""Speaker 1: Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, They announce a tornado warning. So if there's a tornado warning on, It means a tornado is out there somewhere.""Speaker 2: It's scary.""Speaker 1: Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, It's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, Then we have to go in the basement.""Speaker 2: What do you mean a loud train?""Speaker 1: That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.""Speaker 2: But if you hear them coming, Isn't it already too late?""Speaker 1: Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.""Speaker 2: Have you seen a lot of them?""Speaker 1: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.""Speaker 2: Did it hit their house?""Speaker 1: No, It didn't. But they are glad I called them.""Speaker 2: What were they doing when you called?""Speaker 1: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, They could have all been killed.""Speaker 2: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?""Speaker 2: I always like to go for a walk before a supper.""Speaker 2: Is there a problem?""Speaker 1: The delivery people showed up four hours late.""Speaker 2: I apologize for theirtardiness.""Speaker 1: I was late for work because of them.""Speaker 2: Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience.""Speaker 1: I want my money back for the delivery.""Speaker 2: Seeing as they were late, That won't be a problem.""Speaker 1: It shouldn't be a problem.""Speaker 2: Oh Andrea, The Spanish girl?""Speaker 1: Yes, That's her.""Speaker 2: I met her last week at a party. Anyway, You must be from the United States?""Speaker 1: Actually I live in London, But my family lives in Seattle.""Speaker 2: Oh, I am from London as well.""Speaker 1: Where in London do you live?""Speaker 2: In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually. Which is very nice because I love tennis.""Speaker 1: I play tennis there every week. Shall we have a game one day?""Speaker 2: Think, In some way it is an act of God, But in another way, It just is caused by us.""Speaker 1: For example?""Speaker 2: We didn't pay attention to the environment, Cut down trees and polluted the air.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your warning.""Speaker 1: Not at all.""Speaker 2: It is pretty violent, But since it's just robots fighting one another, It isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out.""Speaker 2: Oh, You mean palm reading 5. I've seen that before, But I don't believe in it.""Speaker 1: Are you sure? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?""Speaker 2: Really? You've read books about it? Ok, Then. But only if you want to.""Speaker 1: Ok, Let's see, Well, You've got a long life line, Which is good, And the love line is strong...""Speaker 2: What else do you see? Will I be successful? Will I make a lot of money?""Speaker 1: Hmm, Hard to say, Wait, Yes, It looks like you will do well in business, And your ambition will help you a lot, But...""Speaker 2: What? What is it? What's the matter?""Speaker 1: You seem to have a large gullibility line. You believe everything that you're told.""Speaker 2: Ah, This is my daughter's birthday present. Her birthday is next week.""Speaker 1: And when is your son's birthday?""Speaker 2: That is not for a while. His birthday is only in August.""Speaker 1: But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon.""Speaker 2: And when is your birthday?""Speaker 1: Oh, My birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers.""Speaker 2: I like taking photos out of door.""Speaker 1: Oh, Photography, It's really a good hobby.""Speaker 2: Yes, I usually develop and print all my own photos.""Speaker 1: You yourself have a photo studio?""Speaker 2: You see, I bought it for my husband, But he doesn't like it.""Speaker 1: When did you buy it?""Speaker 2: Last Saturday.""Speaker 1: Can I see the receipt?""Speaker 2: Yes, Here you are.""Speaker 2: You're right. He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him.""Speaker 1: You must be joking. You can't fall in love with someone you've never met!""Speaker 2: I know, But I keep thinking of him every day. And I get really depressed when he's not online.""Speaker 1: I think it's just a crush. You can't be serious.""Speaker 2: Well, This might be silly. But I just can't get him off my mind. And I can't help missing him.""Speaker 1: Did you tell him?""Speaker 2: Yes. He said I'm his dream girl.""Speaker 1: You shouldn't take it too seriously. It might be a lie.""Speaker 2: I know. I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice.""Speaker 2: My immediate family is very large. It's my mother, My father, My two older brothers, My younger sister and me.""Speaker 1: I have a small family. They are my parents, My younger brother and me.""Speaker 2: I thought you were the only child in the family. Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s?""Speaker 1: Yes, It did. But my parents are ethnic minority people. It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children.""Speaker 2: Interesting. What do you think about families with only one child?""Speaker 1: The child must feel very longly. My younger brother is 10 years younger than me. Before he was born, I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da.""Speaker 2: Do you get along well with each other?""Speaker 1: Yes, We are very close. He is 12 years old and very smart. He always makes us laugh a lot.""Speaker 2: You are very lucky to have such a nice family.""Speaker 2: Many. Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year.""Speaker 1: But why do so many people live there?""Speaker 2: Most people grow accustomed to the climate, But there are many others who complain about it all the time.""Speaker 1: Are there any cities where it rains a lot?""Speaker 2: Several. Two good examples are Seattle, In the state of Washington, And Portland, Oregon.""Speaker 1: Tell us about some cold cities.""Speaker 2: In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter. Boston and Chicago are two of them.""Speaker 1: Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston?""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.""Speaker 2: I don't agree, But anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself.""Speaker 1: What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It's pointless.""Speaker 2: Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.""Speaker 1: What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.""Speaker 2: Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday!""Speaker 2: I'm not interested in it. Are you keen on it?""Speaker 1: Yes, That's funny. I thought you liked it.""Speaker 2: I hate it.""Speaker 1: Never mind. It'll be over in 10 minutes.""Speaker 2: No, Not yet. But I like to see what is available.""Speaker 1: Can I have a look as well?""Speaker 2: Of course, Have a seat.""Speaker 1: Oh, This one looks really good. And look at the garden. So beautiful.""Speaker 2: Yes, Nice. But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof.""Speaker 1: Yes, But my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun. And it has a small balcony at the top.""Speaker 2: Well, You can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda. This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer.""Speaker 1: Talking about a barbecue, Didn't you say you are organizing one next week?""Speaker 2: I'd like some toast and chicken wings.""Speaker 1: Okay. Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me.""Speaker 2: Done. Oh, Don't forget to take napkins, Disposable plates, Cups and picnic blanket.""Speaker 1: That's great. We can also take the dragon kite with us. After the picnic, We can fly it.""Speaker 2: Cool, We can take shuttlecock and badminton racket.""Speaker 2: Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London.""Speaker 1: I see. What about transport? How does Shanghai compare to London?""Speaker 2: Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern.""Speaker 1: And what about the number of people on the streets?""Speaker 2: Maybe, But I think they are just for kids.""Speaker 1: No, That's not true. Many adults like the Harry potter books too.""Speaker 2: I went with my husband. Our first stop was Bangkok. We stayed there for 5 days. Then we flew to Hong Kong, Stopover for 3 days. Our last stop was China. We visited the Great Wall.""Speaker 1: You must have a wonderful time.""Speaker 2: Yes. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Have you traveled much, Luke?""Speaker 1: No, My wife doesn't like traveling. We haven't been traveling for more than ten years. The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married. We spent our honeymoon in the Alps.""Speaker 2: ... And for us to gettans in our new bikinis.""Speaker 1: Not this Taiwanese girl. We don't like to getsuntans.""Speaker 2: I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve.""Speaker 1: Where did you learn to sing like that?""Speaker 2: I was part of a band in school.""Speaker 1: You? Wow. And why don't you ever dress like that at work?""Speaker 2: I wanted to, But I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.""Speaker 1: Right on, Right on! Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite! He was low on bread, But Sherry paid for everything.""Speaker 2: Gravy! Jim is such a jive turkey man. He is always hitting me up for cash. Anyway, You wanna book and go grab some grub?""Speaker 2: I was very tired after working all week. Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater.""Speaker 1: Did you download a movie or rent it at the store?""Speaker 2: That happens in many places. In my city, There is a very good drug rehabilitation program. The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes, But I don't know if that's the reason for our relatively low crime rate.""Speaker 1: Some people believe that a tough approach is better. Other prefer a more lenient approach.""Speaker 2: I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly. If most people have similar amounts of money, They will not think of stealing from others.""Speaker 2: It's too bad that you have to leave so early.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much. I had a really good time.""Speaker 2: Thanks for coming! We should meet again sometime soon.""Speaker 1: That would be great! Actually, Can I get your phone number, Ella? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime.""Speaker 2: Anytime. You can reach me 5558929.""Speaker 1: Ok, Got it. I'll call you sometime next week.""Speaker 2: Fine.""Speaker 1: It's time to go and I hope we can get together again soon.""Speaker 2: I wouldn't mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice, But it would get tedious after a while. Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you.""Speaker 1: No-one really believes gossip columnists.""Speaker 2: I think you'll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns. You'd also have to be very careful about every word you said. If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly, It would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines.""Speaker 1: I think you're right about that. I'd need a good manager to be my spokesperson. I could do a lot of charity work, Which would help a lot of people.""Speaker 2: That's a great idea. Which charities would you support?""Speaker 1: I love children, As you know, So probably a children's charity.""Speaker 2: You'd have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity, So you'd really need to be very careful. Anyway, I'd be the first to buy your posters and I'd attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography.""Speaker 2: I couldn't agree with you more. There aren't enough educational programs, And even the news shows are not well done.""Speaker 2: Yes, Now that you mention it, I think we had a chemistry class together in high school.""Speaker 1: You're right! How are you? It's been a long time!""Speaker 2: What did you do after high school?""Speaker 1: I went straight to university afterwards. What about you?""Speaker 2: I took a year off to go travelling.""Speaker 1: That sounds exciting. Where did you go?""Speaker 2: I went all over the world. It was the best year of my life. Where did you go to school?""Speaker 1: I went to a small school in Connecticut. It has a very good reputation for its languages department.""Speaker 2: Oh, Did you study a foreign language?""Speaker 1: Yes, I got a grant to study Chinese.""Speaker 2: That's a very difficult language to learn, Isn't it?""Speaker 1: It is, But it's very rewarding.""Speaker 2: So you can speak Chinese?""Speaker 1: I can, But not as well as I'd like to. I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die!""Speaker 2: As a matter of fact I have, The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two. He's prescribed me some tablets.""Speaker 1: Are you feeling better?""Speaker 2: Yes, It helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work.""Speaker 1: Do you need anything, Grocery?""Speaker 2: Oh, No, I'm fine. My refrigerator is piled up with food. But if it's not too much trouble for you. I'd like something to read.""Speaker 1: Sure, I'll get it for you. Books or magazines?""Speaker 2: I suppose you're right, Lee. Maybe that's why so many Westerners are overweight.""Speaker 1: It's interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, Do not take naps during the day, And yet they can be so heavy.""Speaker 2: What are your main concerns?""Speaker 1: Well, It would give me a chance to grow, But I am wondering if I would like the job.""Speaker 2: I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself.""Speaker 1: I am also thinking about the pay.""Speaker 2: Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?""Speaker 1: Yes, It might be worth it. I am not certain.""Speaker 2: We went to Europe.""Speaker 1: What cities did you go to?""Speaker 2: London, Paris and a few other cities.""Speaker 1: Did you go to Berlin?""Speaker 2: No, We didn't go there. I'd like to go there next time.""Speaker 1: I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin. It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice.""Speaker 2: That's what I've heard.""Speaker 1: I went there last year. If you want, I can give you some information I have about the city.""Speaker 2: Certainly, Work always comes first.""Speaker 1: But it is lucky for us. The company computers don't have software keeping tracks of websites we visit. I have shopped too often online these days.""Speaker 2: No, I knew it all along. He was the obvious choice.""Speaker 1: Do you think he can do well?""Speaker 2: Actually, Costa Rica isn't in South America. It's in Central America.""Speaker 2: Yes. Wait for me at the cafe down my office building. Say 5 PM, Ok?""Speaker 1: No problem. See you!""Speaker 2: I'm going to be a clerk.""Speaker 1: What does a clerk do?""Speaker 2: He works in an office. He writes letters and reports, And he types.""Speaker 1: I want to be a vet.""Speaker 2: A-what?""Speaker 1: A vet-a veterinary surgeon.""Speaker 2: Good gracious! What's that?""Speaker 1: A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals. He's an animal doctor.""Speaker 2: Australia? Oh, There's about twenty million people in Australia right now. A little bit under, But close to twenty.""Speaker 1: Ok. What are the biggest cities?""Speaker 2: The biggest city? The biggest city is Sydney, Then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth. But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia. And Perth is on the west coast, But sort of of out there by itself.""Speaker 1: Ok. Um, If you had to live in one place where would you live?""Speaker 2: I like Brisbane. I had my teenage years in Brisbane, Growing up in Brisbane, Um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city, But Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine.""Speaker 1: Oh, Nice. Actually, What is the capital city of Australia?""Speaker 2: That will be on the second of December. Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus. Do you understand?""Speaker 1: Yes, I understand.""Speaker 2: The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th. Is someone coming to get you?""Speaker 1: No, I don't have a ride yet.""Speaker 2: We will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p.M. Any more questions.""Speaker 1: How much will the trip cost?""Speaker 2: I had a pretty strict upbringing, And my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me.""Speaker 1: Where did you go to university?""Speaker 2: My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing, But I decided to go back to England. I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication.""Speaker 1: What is your current occupation?""Speaker 2: I certainly am. I would have been very disappointed if I hadn't got them.""Speaker 1: Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate?""Speaker 2: What a good idea. I'm quite hungry.""Speaker 1: Me too. I feel very thirsty as well.""Speaker 2: How could you cheat on your wife? You have been married for ten years.""Speaker 2: I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce. But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever?""Speaker 2: Let me see... Yes, One window seat and one aisle seat.""Speaker 1: Ok. But can I trade my seat with you? I prefer the one near the window. I'm a terrible flyer. I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed.""Speaker 2: That's fine. I'd like to be on the aisle anyway. It's easier to get in and out.""Speaker 1: Thanks. Where shall we put our luggage?""Speaker 2: I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment, And the others can go under the seat.""Speaker 1: Good idea.""Speaker 2: Don't forget to keep the seat belt on.""Speaker 1: Ok. Hope it's a pleasant trip.""Speaker 2: Yes!""Speaker 1: And no hijackers.""Speaker 2: Do you watch it or do you still play it?""Speaker 2: I'm in between jobs at the moment.""Speaker 1: What kind of job are you looking for?""Speaker 2: I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field.""Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant?""Speaker 2: No. Is it difficult to find such a job?""Speaker 1: Not if you are good at net-working. Do you like to meet new people?""Speaker 2: Yes. I'm pretty out-going and friendly.""Speaker 1: Do you have experience in the IT field?""Speaker 2: I have some. I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain.""Speaker 1: Do you speak Spanish?""Speaker 2: Yes, But not fluently.""Speaker 1: That's OK. Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet?""Speaker 2: I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me.""Speaker 1: Did you write a clear objective in your resume?""Speaker 2: No, Because I didn't know what I wanted to do.""Speaker 1: I think you need to update your CV. Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it.""Speaker 2: She's very nice.""Speaker 1: What does she teach?""Speaker 2: English, Of course.""Speaker 1: Is she your teacher?""Speaker 2: Yes. She teaches our class three times a week.""Speaker 1: Can she speak Chinese to her students?""Speaker 2: Not very much.""Speaker 2: I'm fine. After ten years, You still look great!""Speaker 1: So do you! How are you doing?""Speaker 2: Not bad. Let's find a table and sit down. We have a lot to talk about.""Speaker 2: Well, I have to take biology, Chemistry, Maps and physics. What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors.""Speaker 1: Yes, I really weak in maps, I did poorly in high school.""Speaker 2: I only had time to visit Edinburgh.""Speaker 1: How did you like it?""Speaker 2: It's fantastic.""Speaker 1: Where did you go there.""Speaker 2: I went to there on business.""Speaker 1: And do you have friend there?""Speaker 2: Yes, A lot of friends.""Speaker 1: You must enjoy yourself.""Speaker 2: That's good. Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity. It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning.""Speaker 1: Good?! For them but not to me.""Speaker 2: So, What's the problem?""Speaker 1: We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend. You know, After work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed. And during the Weekend, You just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner.""Speaker 2: Yes, You are right. But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity. Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning, Analysis and judgement.""Speaker 1: Yes, I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend?""Speaker 2: I'm still not too jazzed about going... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations.""Speaker 1: Well, What if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii? Does that perk your interest?""Speaker 2: You have done a lot of traveling. I'll bet you've learned quite a bit.""Speaker 1: The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype.""Speaker 2: Because you can see the results with the general public?""Speaker 1: That's right. I think we all have much we can learn from each other.""Speaker 2: Oh, Speaking of the conductor, He is indeed a genius. He did a perfect job. His name is Menuhin, A descendent of Russian American immigrants.""Speaker 1: Oh, I learned that he is also a legendary violinist.""Speaker 2: Absolutely right. He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto. That caused a sensation. The audience were stunned by his pure tone.""Speaker 1: Obviously you did enjoy the concert.""Speaker 2: It's a lot harder than I imagined. There are many things that you have to to arrange. I booked a time and date with the funeral home, But I still have a lot of things to do.""Speaker 1: Have you bought a burial plot and a casket?""Speaker 2: No. Wendy is being cremated. She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried. I already chose a cremationurn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.""Speaker 1: I see, That sounds like something she would have really liked. I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful. You are doing a great job.""Speaker 2: Great. We can't keep up with the demand.""Speaker 1: Wow! I'm impressed!""Speaker 2: How about you?""Speaker 1: I quit my job as a food critic.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have.""Speaker 1: When?""Speaker 2: Ten days ago.""Speaker 1: Could Dr. Cole like to attend the party?""Speaker 2: Yes, He will.""Speaker 2: Not really. I thought I'd just have a look today.""Speaker 1: Would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in?""Speaker 2: Sure. I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first.""Speaker 1: Ok. This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder. Why don't you see if you like the way it feel?""Speaker 2: It's very light. That would be good. How is the battery life?""Speaker 1: It's got an above-average battery life. It lasts uptp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes.""Speaker 2: Can you also take still photos with this?""Speaker 1: Yes, That is an option.""Speaker 2: How about night vision? Can you use it in the dark?""Speaker 1: Yes. I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark.""Speaker 2: That's not bad at all. How's the microphone? Does it pick up much sound?""Speaker 1: It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera.""Speaker 2: How does that compare with other models?""Speaker 1: There are models that can pick up more sound than this one, But they're much bigger and heavier than this one.""Speaker 2: You might be right. He does think pretty highly of himself.""Speaker 1: Did you hear the names he was calling me?""Speaker 2: Any day except Tuesday.""Speaker 1: How about Thursday?""Speaker 2: Yes, Thursday would be fine. What time shall I come?""Speaker 1: Oh, About 6:00. Will that be OK?""Speaker 2: Yes, Of course. Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: Then, You should dress well.""Speaker 1: That's right.""Speaker 2: I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you.""Speaker 1: You are smart.""Speaker 2: Of course, The sports shoes don't go with the formal occasions.""Speaker 1: You are right. What kind of shoes should I wear?""Speaker 2: The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers.""Speaker 1: Good idea. Oh, By the way, Would you please pick me up after the party, Honey?""Speaker 2: It'll be too late ; you'd better take a taxi.""Speaker 2: Pick-up lines don't work!""Speaker 1: Come on! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \\'d pick you first. �.""Speaker 2: What? Come on! That's just lame! No girl would fall for that!""Speaker 1: Fine, Then you can say, � So there you are! I'Ve been looking all over for YOU, The woman of my dreams! �.""Speaker 2: That's a good one! I think that's pretty funny.""Speaker 1: Yeah, So you make her laugh, You make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.""Speaker 2: Ok, How does this sound, � I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes. �.""Speaker 2: It might not be the most efficient, But if you think about it, It makes pretty good sense. The stockholders are our investors. They own the capital in our company, So they should have say about what is done with the company.""Speaker 2: How much was the ticket?""Speaker 2: You're so right! Today's movies are just too commercial!""Speaker 2: But I don't know what to do.""Speaker 1: You mean you've never had a boyfriend?""Speaker 2: My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college.""Speaker 1: Until college?""Speaker 2: So what are you going to do? Take up an art class or something?""Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I'Ve decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, It's just that I'Ve been smoking since I was sixteen, And I think it's time to stop.""Speaker 2: I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing?""Speaker 1: One last thing, I'Ve decided to come out of the closet.""Speaker 2: Why can I learn it?""Speaker 1: Don't worry, Do it step by step.""Speaker 1: I think you've lost it.""Speaker 2: Well, That's my opinion.""Speaker 1: I admit that she is much prettier than Kate.""Speaker 2: Oh, There is no comparison. Now we are talking but ugly.""Speaker 2: I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits. I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits, And enable people to be fearless of the hardships, Dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch.""Speaker 1: Have you ever swum in a river or a lake?""Speaker 2: I understand your point, But we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, We would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.""Speaker 1: You can't compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them, The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.""Speaker 2: Well, You are right on that point. This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.""Speaker 1: At least you're doing your part. My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.""Speaker 2: Where will it be?""Speaker 1: We aren't sure yet. Maybe L. A. I think L. A. Would be the best idea.""Speaker 2: Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U.S.?""Speaker 1: Yes, The recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything. Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff. It's going to be good. We can compete more directly with them.""Speaker 2: Great.""Speaker 1: Our computers have a high level of quality now. We can demonstrate it. And our prices will be good. So I think it will really be worthwhile.""Speaker 2: You seem excited about it.""Speaker 1: Well, You know I studied marketing in America. So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me. I'd love to be part of the team.""Speaker 2: Do you honestly think we can compete though? All the computer giants are there.""Speaker 1: Yes, I do. I think we can compete. I think we can make a name for ourselves. It will be hard at first. But if we develop a good advertising campaign, I think we can break into the market.""Speaker 2: The company will have to choose a good advertising firm. And then there's the problem of quality. How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good?""Speaker 1: It takes some time. Because even if the quality is high, People won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name. Name recognition is crucial.""Speaker 2: Well, I hope it all works out, John. I think if you're part of the team, Things will go well. But you know we'd all miss you here. So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving.""Speaker 1: That's very nice of you to say. But if we set up an office there in the States, Maybe you could try to become part of it.""Speaker 2: He's not bad. He can jump a distance of over four meters. I think he just prefers running to jumping. Jimmy's very good at the high jump. He can jump over two meters. Again, That's fine for someone hi.""Speaker 1: Two meters? That means that the high jump bar is above his head! Are any of them good at long-distance running?""Speaker 2: The longest race we run is the 1500 meters. A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes.""Speaker 1: How are they at swimming?""Speaker 2: They're ok. I ask them to swim 500 meters each day. That's 20 lengths of the swimming pool. They're not very fast, But that's ok. I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape.""Speaker 1: Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters.""Speaker 2: I'd be afraid to jump from that height!""Speaker 1: I think that these kinds haven't learnt to be afraid yet. She started diving from a lower height, But she soon wanted to go higher.""Speaker 2: 15.""Speaker 1: What about your brother?""Speaker 2: He's not quite 25.""Speaker 1: Do you miss your family?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: Do you often go home?""Speaker 2: No. But I write to them often.""Speaker 1: How often do you write to them?""Speaker 2: The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked, But the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone.""Speaker 1: Wow! What a hit!""Speaker 2: Yeah, He tackled him so hard his helmet came off.""Speaker 1: Is he ok?""Speaker 2: It looks like it, He's getting up.""Speaker 1: I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team.""Speaker 2: The Giants?""Speaker 1: Yeah.""Speaker 2: Well, Here we go again.""Speaker 1: What happened? Why did everyone get so quiet?""Speaker 2: That's the one. He also was famous for never giving up on his goals.""Speaker 1: That's right. He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected.""Speaker 2: And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights.""Speaker 1: He had great vision, Didn't he?""Speaker 2: No, I don't. I get a bonus each month, Depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients.""Speaker 1: Do you have any breaks?""Speaker 2: We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1. We can take coffee breaks during the day. My boss doesn't mind, As long as we get out work done on time.""Speaker 1: My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks. I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork, Doesn't it?""Speaker 2: There's some paperwork, But most of the time we put any information onto computers. Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network. Do you work in a cubicle?""Speaker 1: Yes, I do. I don't like it very much.""Speaker 2: Hi, Rose. How's everything?""Speaker 1: Fine, Thanks. I'm having several friends over for dinner this Saturday. And I was wondering if you have the time to join us.""Speaker 2: Sounds good. What time do you want me to come?""Speaker 2: Nothing! Anyway, You're right, There's no reason this has to be nasty. My lawyer tells me you'Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, As well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that's done... Finally.""Speaker 1: Let's not go there, Joanne! Ok, So let's start with the record collection, I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.""Speaker 2: Fine, But I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.""Speaker 1: I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne. And you hardly ever use it!""Speaker 2: He's my grandfather, And he never really liked you anyway!""Speaker 1: Whatever! Alright, I'll concede the silly gramophone, If you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.""Speaker 2: How typical, When are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What's next? What about these old photographs?""Speaker 1: Which ones? Let me have a look. Wow, Look at that! That brings back memories... That?""Speaker 2: Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trev fountain, And we got caught in the rain...""Speaker 1: ... And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, Smiling and laughing in the rain...""Speaker 2: Oh, We really did have fun back then, Didn't we?""Speaker 1: Oh, Joanne, Are we making a big mistake? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again? I still love you.""Speaker 2: Oh Jeff! I love you too! I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.""Speaker 2: In the coming, Before going to work.""Speaker 1: You got up so late today. You have, I think. Turn on the TV and set your watch by it.""Speaker 2: Ok. I'll turn it on.""Speaker 1: All right. It's just four o'clock.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm setting my watch at four. Thank you.""Speaker 2: I'd love it. Working out is more fun with a friend.""Speaker 1: I'll get my things and meet you there.""Speaker 2: How fun! Can I bring something?""Speaker 1: Don't worry about it! Just come at five.""Speaker 2: I make a mean potato salad!""Speaker 1: Well, If you insist, You are welcome to bring a potato salad!""Speaker 2: When will I be able to do that?""Speaker 1: You can do it right now, If you'd like.""Speaker 2: That's fine.""Speaker 1: Please fill out this application.""Speaker 2: Then what do I do?""Speaker 1: I just need to take your picture.""Speaker 2: How long will it take for my passport to be ready?""Speaker 1: You will get it in a few weeks.""Speaker 2: But I also want ya to do me a favor.""Speaker 1: What?""Speaker 2: You gotta have some better deodorant.""Speaker 2: Well. It's not all my fault, Anna. You are responsible, Too.""Speaker 1: I don't want to argue anymore. Please get out of my life!""Speaker 2: I think we can still talk.""Speaker 1: No way! Please don't follow me around.""Speaker 2: Talk it easy, Anna. You really don't hate me. Do you?""Speaker 2: I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time.""Speaker 1: Well, The weather is so unpredictable this time of year.""Speaker 2: You're right. We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Look! It looks as if it is going to rain.""Speaker 2: The weatherman predicts a fine day today.""Speaker 2: Yes, Sunday sounds fine. What time?""Speaker 1: Does 6 thirty suit you?""Speaker 2: It suits us fine. We'll see you then.""Speaker 2: Are you sure? What about Carl Lewis? He won four golds, Didn't he?""Speaker 1: Carl won the gold in the 100, 200, Long jump, And 4x100 relay in 1984.""Speaker 2: I've already got plans, Too.""Speaker 1: Then when do you think we could go out together?""Speaker 2: How about Friday? Only in that day can I arrange it.""Speaker 1: Ok. Any time on Friday will be OK with me.""Speaker 2: My older sister Judy will be here soon to help. She already has a boy and a girl of her own...""Speaker 2: As you know, I am a sports fan. And these papers are famous for their sports section. So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in.""Speaker 1: I got your meaning. Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks.""Speaker 2: Correct! What about you, Fred?""Speaker 1: I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired. I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste.""Speaker 2: Don't overdo it.""Speaker 1: Shall we have a drink someday?""Speaker 2: I hope so too.""Speaker 1: Is the weather usually like this here?""Speaker 2: It's usually a bit hotter than today.""Speaker 1: What's the weather like in winter?""Speaker 2: It's pretty cold and it often snows.""Speaker 1: I wonder what it's going to be like tomorrow.""Speaker 2: Let's hear the weather report later. What's the weather like in your hometown?""Speaker 1: Neither too cold, Nor too hot.""Speaker 2: That's quite a lovely weather.""Speaker 1: Yes, Especially in spring.""Speaker 2: Have you ever seen a hurricane?""Speaker 1: Once, When I was a child.""Speaker 2: Do they often happen in your country?""Speaker 1: Now and then.""Speaker 2: I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman.""Speaker 1: I know all the tricks of the trade. It is quitetiring and difficult to be promoted.""Speaker 2: Maybe. But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience. What about you?""Speaker 1: I am a reporter at a TV station.""Speaker 2: Do you like your job?""Speaker 1: Yes, I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15, 000 $ a year.""Speaker 2: Which kind of news do you catch?""Speaker 1: I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades.""Speaker 2: Are you feel tired?""Speaker 1: Sometimes. News happened out of expectation. Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing.""Speaker 2: You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter.""Speaker 2: I think so. Here it is. It's by the basin.""Speaker 1: Is it a two-pin socket?""Speaker 2: Yes, It is.""Speaker 2: But really, Maybe this can work. Everyone loves coffee, And everyone needs motor oil.""Speaker 2: Not really. Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre, Especially in the main shopping areas. The public transport system is pretty good.""Speaker 1: What about restaurants and entertainment?""Speaker 2: There are restaurants with food from all over the world. We have a small china-town near the city centre. There are many Indian, Thai, And Italian restaurants all over the city centre. There are manys.""Speaker 1: Is there a lot of nightlife in your city?""Speaker 2: There are several good clubs near the city centre. Many people in my city prefer something more cultural, So we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas.""Speaker 1: It sounds like a really exciting city to live in.""Speaker 2: I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me. But if I keep gulping down one cup after another, I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick.""Speaker 1: You lose face by refusing to drink, And the host might think you refuse to give him face. The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up. This will endear you.""Speaker 2: A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night, Crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood.""Speaker 1: Then he must be opening his heart to the friends. In a word, As long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort, No one will jeer at you.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I did. But my fiancee has an important project.""Speaker 1: That's really a shame. By the way, Who will be the bridesmaid?""Speaker 2: Julie's friend, Mary. And John will be the best man.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry, But he's not in, He's gone out on business.""Speaker 1: Oh! I just drop in on him for a chat.""Speaker 2: Please come in for a cup of coffee.""Speaker 2: Who're the producer, The director, The stars, Heroine and the hero?""Speaker 2: I'd love it. Working out is more fun with a friend.""Speaker 1: I'll get my things and meet you there.""Speaker 2: I am fine. In fact, I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle. But the other guy is in critical condition.""Speaker 1: You're serious?""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm serious. I'm really sorry about missing your concert.""Speaker 1: I guess I misjudged you. I hope you can forgive me.""Speaker 2: What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year?""Speaker 1: Autumn is also very nice In Washington.""Speaker 2: Is it very cold in winter there?""Speaker 1: No. It isn't. But sometimes it slows a lot in winter.""Speaker 2: Does it rain a lot in summer there?""Speaker 1: Oh. Yes. Sometimes it rains very heavily.""Speaker 2: How about here in Beijing?""Speaker 1: There's a lot of rain in summer. But it seldom rains in autumn.""Speaker 2: I feel it's rather dry here.""Speaker 1: That's true. Many people from the south don't like the whether here.""Speaker 2: Are you from south?""Speaker 1: No. I'm from the north. I was born in Beijing actually.""Speaker 2: What's the color of her eyes?""Speaker 1: Dark blue.""Speaker 2: How old is she?""Speaker 2: No problem. So how have you been?""Speaker 1: I've been great. What about you?""Speaker 2: I've been good. I'm in school right now.""Speaker 1: What school do you go to?""Speaker 2: I go to PCC.""Speaker 1: Do you like it there?""Speaker 2: It's okay. It's a really big campus.""Speaker 1: Good luck with school.""Speaker 2: But I don't like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do.""Speaker 2: That is a lot of friends. Do you have a best friend?""Speaker 1: Of course. I have lots of best friends.""Speaker 2: How many best friends do you have?""Speaker 1: I think about twenty-five.""Speaker 2: Hmm. I have only one best friend.""Speaker 1: I feel sorry for you.""Speaker 2: I have only a few friends.""Speaker 1: You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you.""Speaker 2: I trust you.""Speaker 1: All right, Open your eyes. ( Rose opens her eyes. She stretches her arms, And Jack stands behind her, Arms around her. ).""Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't mind it either. We'll both end up rich slobs and not need it, But what if we do, You know?""Speaker 1: Yeah. It won't be much, But at least we'll have a monthly check when we get old.""Speaker 2: Yeah, My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive.""Speaker 1: Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it.""Speaker 2: Actually, My office is right around the corner.""Speaker 1: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Yeah, It was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, But here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.""Speaker 1: Sure, You still have my contact details, Right?""Speaker 2: You know what, This is really embarrassing, But your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me?""Speaker 2: Nah, It's a place where homelesspeople go to eat.""Speaker 1: How did you get involved in something like that?""Speaker 2: Well, The minister at my church told us about it, And it seemed interesting. I thought I'd try it once, And if I didn't like it I'd stop.""Speaker 1: So what do you do there?""Speaker 2: It's simple. All we do is prepare some food, Usually sandwiches and some fruit, And give it out to them at the soup kitchen.""Speaker 1: Yeah, It sounds easy. How long does it take?""Speaker 2: Only about two hours, For a couple of days a month. Why don't you give it a try?""Speaker 1: I don't know. I mean, I like helping the community and all that, But I don't know if I have the time...""Speaker 2: You're right. I wasn't. I hear nothing.""Speaker 1: Nothing?""Speaker 2: Not a sound on the city streets, Just the beat of my own heart, I think that's how it goes, Something like that.""Speaker 1: You and Patricia got engaged, Didn't you? You can tell me.""Speaker 2: Engaged?""Speaker 1: Come on.""Speaker 2: Are you crazy?""Speaker 2: I will help to prepare food, Feed animals and clean up. I'm very excited about it now.""Speaker 1: It must be a unique experience. I'm looking forward to share your story when you come back.""Speaker 2: Of course I'm pale. It's just now the beginning of spring. I don't have my summer tan yet.""Speaker 1: I guess. Are you sure you're taking care of yourself?""Speaker 2: Thanks. Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink?""Speaker 1: I'm sure of that. There's enough food here to feed an army!""Speaker 2: That birthday cake looks wonderful, But you haven't put any candles on it yet.""Speaker 1: Thanks for reminding me. I'Ve prepared some party games for the children too.""Speaker 2: I'Ve brought a tape with lots of children's songs on it.""Speaker 2: Yes, I do, Very much.""Speaker 1: There's a concert tonight. Would you like to go and listen to it?""Speaker 2: That's out of the question.""Speaker 1: Please.""Speaker 2: Not a chance.""Speaker 1: Not even for an hour?""Speaker 2: Good gracious. That's incredible!""Speaker 1: She married Jerrod.""Speaker 2: You're kidding.""Speaker 1: She's going to live in Paris.""Speaker 2: Literature and economy.""Speaker 1: By the way, Would you like to see movies?""Speaker 2: That's OK.""Speaker 1: What do you do in your spare time?""Speaker 2: I like to play golf, Play badminton or crack jokes.""Speaker 1: I just like to sleep like a lazy cat.""Speaker 2: It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food.""Speaker 1: I can hardly wait!""Speaker 2: Do you know the day they plan to open?""Speaker 1: I'll double check the announcement.""Speaker 2: It was my pleasure. How about this evening? I feel very hungry now.""Speaker 1: Fine, I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area, Food there is pretty spicy too. Shall we try that one?""Speaker 2: I'm down in spirits.""Speaker 1: What's up?""Speaker 2: My manager jumped on me for my mistake today.""Speaker 1: You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing.""Speaker 2: I think I'm too clumsy. I can do nothing well.""Speaker 1: You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done.""Speaker 2: But I doubt myself.""Speaker 2: Oh. I've really forgotten it.""Speaker 1: Now, Close your eyes. ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand. ).""Speaker 2: A silk scarf. I love it. Thank you very much. My lovely son.""Speaker 2: You look prettier than before.""Speaker 2: Fine, Thank you, And you?""Speaker 1: Pretty good. What brings you here?""Speaker 2: Because I want to study english literature. But I think chemistry is better for getting a job.""Speaker 1: Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college. Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated?""Speaker 2: I'm going to my parents 'house for my father's birthday.""Speaker 1: How old is he today?""Speaker 2: It's his 50th birthday.""Speaker 1: Well, Wish him a happy birthday for me.""Speaker 2: Sure thing. What are your plans for the evening?""Speaker 1: I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight.""Speaker 2: Well, If you can wait until tomorrow night, I'll go with you then.""Speaker 1: Sorry, I've got people coming over tomorrow night.""Speaker 2: Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us.""Speaker 1: Sounds that way. Maybe some other time then?""Speaker 2: Sure. Hey, I'm sorry, But I've got to get going.""Speaker 1: Yeah, Me, Too. It's about time I made a move.""Speaker 2: Say hello to your friends for me.""Speaker 1: Likewise. See you later.""Speaker 2: Glad to meet you, Wang Lin. I am Mary.""Speaker 1: Is this your first time in Beijing?""Speaker 2: Yes. My company has an office here, And I have just been transferred.""Speaker 1: Here is my phone number. If you need anyone to show you around, Call me.""Speaker 2: Oh I see, Okay. So I heard you got married. Congratulations!""Speaker 1: Ah thank you! I'm very excited. We were going to get married next year, But then we decided to get married on holiday instead. It was wonderful.""Speaker 2: That sounds so romantic! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, But we had to postpone our plans. We just don't have the money!""Speaker 1: I know what you mean. I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive, Don't you?""Speaker 2: I sure do. In my opinion, It's actually becoming more expensive than back home.""Speaker 2: It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills. It also plays MP3 files, Which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer.""Speaker 1: Wow! Anything else?""Speaker 2: This one comes with its own folding keyboard. It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program. I can use the stylus to write on the screen.""Speaker 1: What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies?""Speaker 2: ( Laugh ) All right. You caught me in the act. I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out. I was just writing a note to put on her desk.""Speaker 1: You mean you're going to ask her out in a note? You big chicken!""Speaker 2: I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in person.""Speaker 1: But, You work with her everyday.""Speaker 2: That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, When I even think about asking her out, I get tongue-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red.""Speaker 1: You've dated a lot. What's so different about Diana?""Speaker 2: Well, For one thing, She's gorgeous. She's so upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together. But, What if I'm wrong. Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh... Forget it. This was a bad idea.""Speaker 1: Well, I guess you don't want this note, Then.""Speaker 2: What note?""Speaker 1: I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night.""Speaker 2: You're kidding! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything.""Speaker 1: Sorry. What can I say? Now, Do you want the note or what?""Speaker 2: Yeah, I want the note.""Speaker 1: Have a great time tomorrow night.""Speaker 2: I wouldn't exactly characterize it in that way. I think something happened. Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to... What if he showed up, Took one look at me and left?""Speaker 1: Not possible.""Speaker 2: Maybe, There was a subway accident.""Speaker 1: Absolutely.""Speaker 2: A train got trapped underground with him inside.""Speaker 1: And no phone.""Speaker 2: He is tall and slim, Fair-haired.""Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?""Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?""Speaker 2: He didn't say, But he said he would call me.""Speaker 1: Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!""Speaker 2: Oh, David. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What should I do if he doesn't call me?""Speaker 1: Come on, Mary, You're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry.""Speaker 2: Thank you, David. You're always so encouraging.""Speaker 2: For accounting system and things like that, You mean?""Speaker 1: Yes, But they are used for other things, Too. Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris.""Speaker 2: Yes?""Speaker 1: The man asked where we want to go, Then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply. A few moment later, He gave us two tickets.""Speaker 2: Of course, His machine must have been connected to a computer.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I'm lucky to be his wife.""Speaker 1: He's after your own heart, It is important.""Speaker 2: So he will make a perfect husband. Make sure you will be here next Monday.""Speaker 2: A gold watch!""Speaker 1: Do you like it?""Speaker 2: Not some crazy diet fat I hope.""Speaker 1: No no, I just changed my eating habits. I eat a balance meal. And I eat less than before.""Speaker 2: Really? What's he been doing?""Speaker 1: You know, Just giving me lots to do. I'm really busy right now.""Speaker 2: Are you? What are you busy with?""Speaker 2: What? Why? Can't you renew it?""Speaker 1: The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.""Speaker 2: Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.""Speaker 1: I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I'm gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.""Speaker 2: Well, Let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.""Speaker 1: Actually, Would you mind looking after my pettarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?""Speaker 2: I have a good idea to solve it. The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes.""Speaker 1: It would probably be very expensive.""Speaker 2: I think the government can afford it. Besides, There are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement.""Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don't seem to have enough money to educate kids properly.""Speaker 2: If we are to invest more money to education, We will need to raise taxes. That wouldn't be popular with voters.""Speaker 1: Most voters what everything bout ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, But without increasing taxes.""Speaker 2: The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.""Speaker 2: I know. That's why I bought it. I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing.""Speaker 1: And the necklace, It matches your dress marvelously.""Speaker 2: It's very nice of you to say so. I should say you are glamorous yourself, As a matter of fact.""Speaker 2: Because it's off-season, We got a really good package deal to Paris, So we went there.""Speaker 1: I've always wanted to go to Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top?""Speaker 2: That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them?""Speaker 1: Sure. What's this one a picture of?""Speaker 2: Oh, That's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city.""Speaker 1: You don't look very happy in that picture.""Speaker 2: No, By that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had had enough of art galleries, Cathedrals, Fountains, Statues, And palaces!""Speaker 1: So what did you do?""Speaker 2: We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market. We had a few coffees, Watched a movie, And went for a swim in the pool at the hotel.""Speaker 1: My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Louvre?""Speaker 2: Of course! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though.""Speaker 2: How did you know?""Speaker 1: Cindy told me about you in our gym class.""Speaker 2: I see. Do you live in this neighborhood, Too?""Speaker 1: My house is next door to yours.""Speaker 2: Oh, Cindy did mention you before. You're Alexander Newman.""Speaker 2: We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan.""Speaker 1: What do you do on that day?""Speaker 2: We'll have ricedumplings. What's more, There are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China.""Speaker 2: Well, You can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan.""Speaker 1: It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week.""Speaker 2: Yes. And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major.""Speaker 1: If you were to take on a double major, What would be your first choice?""Speaker 2: I think with International Business a language would be appropriate.""Speaker 1: Have you even thought that far ahead? I mean what country would you like to do business with?""Speaker 2: Are you kidding? You got the leading role.""Speaker 1: I know, But I've done that so Ay times. It's getting old. The leading guy is always the same macho A.""Speaker 2: I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A.""Speaker 1: Next time. You are going to love your part. I've seen the script.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm not too sure, Actually. I'Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks. Why don't I call you later?""Speaker 2: How do you get through the stuffy daytime?""Speaker 2: Oh, So you're a teacher.""Speaker 1: Yeah, History, What about you?""Speaker 2: I'm in the car business.""Speaker 1: Salesman?""Speaker 2: Yes, That's right.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see, By the way, My name's Mary.""Speaker 2: This is Nathaniel Brown.""Speaker 1: And what is your call regarding?""Speaker 2: I'd like to talk to her about my accommodation situation.""Speaker 1: Ok, I'll try and put you through. Please hold.""Speaker 2: Ok.""Speaker 1: ... Sorry, Her line is busy at the moment. Can I take a message?""Speaker 2: Sure. Can you have her call me back on my cell phone number?""Speaker 1: Ok. What's your number?""Speaker 2: It's 0-7- 7-8- 7-3- 6-7- 6-8- 8.""Speaker 1: Let me repeat that back to you. That's zero, Double seven, Eight, Seven, Three, Six, Seven, Double six, Double eight.""Speaker 2: No, There's no double six at the end of the number. It's just zero, Double seven, Eight, Seven, Three, Six, Seven, Six, Double eight.""Speaker 1: I got it. When should I have her call you back?""Speaker 2: Anytime before 6 pm tonight.""Speaker 1: Ok, Nathaniel. I'll have Ms. Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6 pm.""Speaker 2: Thank you!""Speaker 1: Bye!""Speaker 2: Come in! Quickly!""Speaker 1: So, Since when is your house a bank?""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: I mean, What's up with the locks and iron bars on your windows.""Speaker 2: Security, Dan, Security! You can never be too safe you know! A lot of sickos out there. Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window.""Speaker 1: What's the matter with you? Why are you acting all paranoid?""Speaker 2: Paranoid? I'm not paranoid! I'm cautious! You see Dan, We have to be on guard at all time! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you! Telemarketers, Solicitors, Even your bank! They have way too much information! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.""Speaker 1: Ok, Well, What did you want to see me about?""Speaker 2: Was I? Sorry, I didn'y mean to be. I do apologize.""Speaker 1: And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?""Speaker 2: So how have you been?""Speaker 2: Either way. I don't care.""Speaker 1: How about a snack after work?""Speaker 2: I couldn't careless.""Speaker 1: Would you rather stay home?""Speaker 2: Whatever you say.""Speaker 1: Are you really interested in doing something?""Speaker 2: I have changed a case for it.""Speaker 1: Can a handset case be changed?""Speaker 2: Of course. That's why I bought this type. I can change its case frequently, So it is novel to use it.""Speaker 1: How many cases are accessible?""Speaker 2: There are two more, One is orange and the other is pink. I have bought them all.""Speaker 2: I see.""Speaker 2: I'll turn the heat up.""Speaker 2: I know that. I have seen the film as the same title. Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess.""Speaker 1: Yes, You are right. I like the song in the movie, Edelweiss, Do you remember it?""Speaker 2: Of course, It is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant.""Speaker 1: Those young actors play the roles perfectly.""Speaker 2: I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie. Have you bought the tickets?""Speaker 1: No, I am asking you whether you will go to see it.""Speaker 2: I'd like to. But I'm afraid I can't.""Speaker 1: I'm wondering if you like to go to the theatre then.""Speaker 2: That's sounds great.""Speaker 1: Ok. How about give me a ring, Then?""Speaker 2: No. I'd better not.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 1: Yeah, And?""Speaker 2: I decided to put him up while he's here, Big mistake!""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: He's lazy. I tried being a good host, But if you give him an inch, He'll take a mile.""Speaker 1: I guess you think twice next time he comes.""Speaker 2: You can say that again.""Speaker 1: So how long has he here for?""Speaker 2: Two weeks. If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming.""Speaker 2: The new couple next door divorced. Have you heard about it?""Speaker 1: No. The Hills? Who filed for divorce first?""Speaker 2: I guess it Is Mrs Hill. She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary.""Speaker 1: Oh, Maybe not. It's just your guess. Do not give currency to idle gossip.""Speaker 2: I don't know. She always said I didn't love her, But I did.""Speaker 1: Did you think about talking to her again? Maybe she is waiting for your call.""Speaker 2: I have asked for a talk again, But she refused and said she wanted to be quiet.""Speaker 2: Wow!""Speaker 1: Mr. : Furthermore, When you are dismissed in the afternoon, You will be divided into two waves.""Speaker 2: Two waves?""Speaker 1: Mr. : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time. So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students.""Speaker 2: What is it? Why did you buy a brick?""Speaker 1: There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes. He said he had to get rid of them quick.""Speaker 2: And?""Speaker 1: So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.""Speaker 2: And it's a brick?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?""Speaker 1: I wanted to. But he said, No, The box is still in its plastic wrap from the store. If it's opened, Other people won't believe it's new.""Speaker 2: So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.""Speaker 1: Yes, It was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products. Look, It even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.""Speaker 2: But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?""Speaker 1: He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.""Speaker 2: Aha! Now I understand. You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk. So, What I think is, You deserve to get cheated!""Speaker 1: C'mon, Don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it. We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.""Speaker 2: That's no problem. He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy. And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from. Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there. Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around. So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you. Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.""Speaker 2: When everything is over.""Speaker 1: Now that it is all over. Can I go now?""Speaker 2: Not yet. You should stand still for another few minutes. Late-comers must be recorded.""Speaker 2: Me too. Do you think we are boring people?""Speaker 1: I don't think we are boring. It's just that we don't have any hobbies.""Speaker 2: That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?""Speaker 1: That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, So I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.""Speaker 2: I like to play the piano for fun.""Speaker 1: Yeah. That can be a good hobby.""Speaker 2: Hobbies are great. I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do.""Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know. I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids, I suppose. But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money.""Speaker 1: One thing's certain. If I had a lot of money, I wouldn't work any more.""Speaker 2: Wouldn't you? What would you do with all that spare time?""Speaker 1: As I said, I'd go round the world.""Speaker 2: What would you do after that?""Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know. It'd take me a long time to go round the world.""Speaker 2: It doesn't sound very exciting.""Speaker 1: Anyway, We haven't won the Pools, And we're not likely to win them. So there isn't much point in talking about it, Is there?""Speaker 2: I'd be happy if I got a rise.""Speaker 1: And my wife would be happy if I bought her amink coat.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for amink coat, So let's come down to earth and have another drink.""Speaker 1: What'll you have?""Speaker 2: I'll have a pint of the best.""Speaker 1: I'd have a Scotch if I were you. We deserve it.""Speaker 2: I can't bear being near cats. They don't seem to like me either.""Speaker 1: I like wild animals. I don't like spiders and snakes. I think spiders and snakes are disgusting.""Speaker 2: I'm fond of snakes. I think they're great. I agree with you about spiders though. I think spiders are horrible. I think it's because they have so many legs.""Speaker 1: I think bears are wonderful. Pandas are fantastic. I low the people who kill them for their fur.""Speaker 2: I agree. I'm carry about mice. I think they're so cute!""Speaker 2: If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch, Remember to have something else for them to do. If you don't, They'll get bored and misbehave.""Speaker 1: They could go out and play with their friends.""Speaker 2: Sure. You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time.""Speaker 1: Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing. He watches too muchTv too.""Speaker 2: Is she just working temporarily? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave.""Speaker 2: I've got all the cords plugged in, But it appears that I'm offline.""Speaker 1: Are you using dial-up or broadband?""Speaker 2: Actually, I've got a wireless connection.""Speaker 1: In that case, You need to turn on your airport.""Speaker 2: I hook up to the Internet every day. I can't believe I didn't do that.""Speaker 1: Do you like ever chat online?""Speaker 2: No, But I'd like to. Do you have to pay to do instant messaging?""Speaker 1: Oh, No. You can register for free. Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it.""Speaker 2: What do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them?""Speaker 1: Well, You can always block them. When I don't feel like talking to certain people online, That's what I do.""Speaker 2: What's your email address? I'll add you to my contacts list.""Speaker 1: It's aubreyinchina@yahoo. Com.""Speaker 2: Cool. We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger. Thanks for your help.""Speaker 2: Oh, Definitely. I remember, When I first arrived in Guangzhou, My girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere.""Speaker 2: I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, Until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.""Speaker 1: A shouting match? You're so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don't believe it.""Speaker 2: I am not exaggerating at all. I'm telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time.""Speaker 1: Yes, Perhaps. Chinese usually don't notice that sort of thing. Maybe it's quite natural to us.""Speaker 2: Let me think a minute. I think I always try to take every chance to practice.""Speaker 1: What if there is no chance? I mean what if you don't have a partner, What will you do?""Speaker 2: Well, I talk to myself. That is, I play one role first, Than the other.""Speaker 2: It's just what I wanted.""Speaker 1: No regrets?""Speaker 2: I'm really pleased with it. Thanks.""Speaker 1: I'm glad you're so happy.""Speaker 2: Well, If that's the case, I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have. I can only do what I know, And live how I've lived all my life, Because I'm a fairly stubborn person.""Speaker 1: It seems to me that now you're famous. You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties.""Speaker 2: I don't go to parties. The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house. Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in. I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen.""Speaker 1: Then fans don't see you much in public places.""Speaker 2: Yes. I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life. I love what I do and I love how I spend my time, Which isn't in a public place.""Speaker 1: A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts. I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood, That you've watched and thought, 'Well, They've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about.'.""Speaker 2: Right. In the countryside, Things are more complicated.""Speaker 1: Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities?""Speaker 2: Yes I am. I got married five years ago.""Speaker 1: Oh I see. That's nice. Did you meet your husband at work?""Speaker 2: This cafe offers a wireless internet connection. That means I can get on the net for free while I'm here. Of course, I have to buy a cup of coffee!""Speaker 1: That's great. Can you do it anywhere?""Speaker 2: No. You can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection. There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city.""Speaker 1: So, What programs do you have on your laptop?""Speaker 2: I'Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs.""Speaker 1: I know you are keen on photography. It's very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera. Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone, Anywhere, At anytime!""Speaker 2: Fine, Thank you. And you?""Speaker 2: I feel exactly the same way as you.""Speaker 1: Don't, Don't, Don't, Don't say that. That, That makes it worse.""Speaker 2: What? You don't love me? Me, Either.""Speaker 1: You don't love me?""Speaker 2: No.""Speaker 1: But we're so right for each other.""Speaker 2: Have you?""Speaker 1: May I ask where you live?""Speaker 2: Just two blocks away, In that tall building.""Speaker 1: That's it. I live there, Too. I live on the sixth floor.""Speaker 2: My family move in just two weeks ago. We live on the fourth floor.""Speaker 1: It's a small world! May I know your name, Miss?""Speaker 2: I'm Chen Ming.""Speaker 1: How do you do, Miss Chen? I'm Song Mei.""Speaker 2: I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Song.""Speaker 1: Are you going to your office now, Miss Chen?""Speaker 2: Are you serious? It is always crowded with many people.""Speaker 1: Why not? I would like to buy some candies. Since there are so many people, I think they must have delicious candy.""Speaker 2: Look at the candy bar over there. It is so colorful and tasty.""Speaker 1: They have lollypops, Chocolate drops, Fruit candy, Mints, Pearbrittles and toffee. They are in different colors and flavors.""Speaker 2: I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything.""Speaker 1: Me too. I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people.""Speaker 2: To be honest, I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat. I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not.""Speaker 1: You are a candy terminator. Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities.""Speaker 2: That is true. Speaking of cavities, I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now. Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home.""Speaker 2: Oh. It's a nice day indeed.""Speaker 1: I hope it won't be too hot, I can't stand the heat.""Speaker 2: What did you get?""Speaker 1: A B plus.""Speaker 2: That's not bad.""Speaker 1: But I should have aced it. I mean I finished the paper so quickly, Thinking it's a piece of cake. But when I knew my result, I was like what? That can't be true!""Speaker 2: Listen, John. I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress, But you really want to give up?""Speaker 1: No, I don't. I just don't know how to handle this. This is my first time, You know.""Speaker 2: I know. Don't worry. Do you know what you should do?""Speaker 1: What?""Speaker 2: You need to blow off some steam. The world is not on your shoulder.""Speaker 1: How?""Speaker 2: Forget about school and exams. Come over to my house and have fun. I have some really good DVDs.""Speaker 1: Thanks. But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight. I have to get an early start in the morning.""Speaker 2: Then go to bed and have a good sleep.""Speaker 1: I guess that's what I need. Thanks. You're being a really good friend.""Speaker 2: Of course I am. Well, Pleasant dreams!""Speaker 2: The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window.""Speaker 1: I can't see him. Where?""Speaker 2: Right there.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see him now. Wait! That's...""Speaker 2: Yes, It's Mel Gibson.""Speaker 1: Oh, Wow! It's really him! Who is that woman he's with?""Speaker 2: I don't know. Why don't you go ask for his autograph?""Speaker 1: I can't do that.""Speaker 2: Well, All the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids.""Speaker 1: That's it? That's the tradition?""Speaker 2: Well, In fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing.""Speaker 1: I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun.""Speaker 2: I'm glad to help you. But what is it you want to ask about?""Speaker 1: I am worried about the meeting this morning.""Speaker 2: Why? I think the meeting went well.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: Yes. But what are you worried about?""Speaker 1: I'm afraid I was too rude.""Speaker 2: Rude? You weren't rude at all, Annie. Why do you think you were rude?""Speaker 1: Well, I maybe talked to Mr. Drummond too directly. I thought I maybe said too much. I don't want him to be angry.""Speaker 2: I understand. But really you weren't rude at all. You said what you thought. I think he appreciates that.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: But I am new here, And I'm not sure he is used to that.""Speaker 2: You mean because you are a woman?""Speaker 1: Yes. And he is the president of the company.""Speaker 2: Listen, Annie. You shouldn't worry about Mr. Drummond. He is a very good man to work for. He is not sexist at all. He appreciates people for their ideas. And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women.""Speaker 1: I am very happy to hear that, Karen. It's good to know I'm working in such a company.""Speaker 2: I agree with you on that, Annie. I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now. I feel he appreciates his employees for their work, Not their gender. I would never change jobs.""Speaker 1: Good. Thank you for telling me this.""Speaker 2: I work very hard and that's it, You know, Practice makes perfect.""Speaker 1: Isn't there anything else?""Speaker 2: I have no idea.""Speaker 1: You must have a high IQ score.""Speaker 2: Well, Jerry, Let me tell you a secret.""Speaker 1: Go ahead.""Speaker 2: My IQ score is slightly above average.""Speaker 1: Seriously? But you are such a genius.""Speaker 2: Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure.""Speaker 1: Well, Perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ.""Speaker 2: You can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, You can also get high marks.""Speaker 1: Oh, Thank you. I'm going to the library, Are you coming?""Speaker 2: Yeah. And I never want to go again.""Speaker 1: I remember the first time I went. My back was sore, I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt, And my legs would cramp if I walked too fast.""Speaker 2: That's exactly how I feel now.""Speaker 1: It's only like that the first couple of times.""Speaker 2: Ha. There won't be a next time.""Speaker 1: You gotta give it a chance. It's fun after awhile.""Speaker 2: I worked over the summer at a restaurant. Have to make tuition money, Right? What did you do?""Speaker 1: I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up.""Speaker 2: So are you officially a junior now?""Speaker 1: Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, But I took 15 because the price was the same.""Speaker 2: That makes sense. So where is Nicole?""Speaker 1: She dropped out of school completely.""Speaker 2: Really? Why?""Speaker 1: She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, They asked her if she wanted to work full time.""Speaker 2: Wow. She's so lucky. She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job.""Speaker 1: It sounds good now, But I'm traditional. I want the degree, So I wouldn't have accepted the offer.""Speaker 2: Do you know how much they are paying her?""Speaker 2: No. But my husband smokes 20 or more a day.""Speaker 1: When did you begin to smoke?""Speaker 2: I had my first cigarette when I was 17.""Speaker 1: Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?""Speaker 2: Sorry, Sally, It's not your fault.""Speaker 1: So, What's the problem?""Speaker 2: I drew a blank on the algebra test.""Speaker 1: No kidding! Didn't you study for it?""Speaker 2: Yeah, But nothing was clear during the test.""Speaker 1: That's too bad, Anyway, I'm sure things will turn around next semester.""Speaker 2: I'm thinking of dropping out.""Speaker 1: You can't do that, Jenny!""Speaker 2: I'm dead serious about this, Sally.""Speaker 2: Anybody I know?""Speaker 1: Well, Pam Franklin lives next door to us. By the way, Can I go to her house this Saturday?""Speaker 2: Of course. You didn't have to ask me.""Speaker 1: That's what Pam said.""Speaker 2: That's a hard time. The air is cold and damp, And the road is often icy.""Speaker 1: It's boring, Right?""Speaker 2: Sure.""Speaker 1: Do you get much rain during the summer?""Speaker 2: Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area.""Speaker 1: So you should bring an umbrella often.""Speaker 2: You're welcome at any time.""Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality. I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay.""Speaker 2: You're most welcome.""Speaker 1: I'm afraid I have to go now. The plane will take off soon.""Speaker 2: Is it difficult to learn?""Speaker 1: No, It is easy.""Speaker 2: How should I do?""Speaker 1: You just follow me.""Speaker 2: All right. By the way, Do you often dance?""Speaker 1: Yup, Because dance can relax myself.""Speaker 2: I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you.""Speaker 1: Loving to look beautiful is women's nature. In fact, I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today.""Speaker 2: No kidding! Again?! You just went shopping yesterday. You really are a shopaholic.""Speaker 1: Well, I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi. They are too small. I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size.""Speaker 2: What would you do with all the animals? You couldn't just let them go. Besides, Some people would still hunt them. Meat has become an integral part of our diet.""Speaker 1: We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible.""Speaker 2: That's true. I think zoo are a good idea, Because they allow people to get close to animals. I think it's good for kids to see wild animals.""Speaker 1: I agree. I'm an adult and I love going to the zoo. I don't like animals experiments though. I believe that we can do tests in other ways.""Speaker 2: I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced.""Speaker 1: That's good news. The good thing is that most people treat their pets well.""Speaker 2: Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals, But those stories are rare.""Speaker 1: Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals.""Speaker 2: Very seldom, Because tea hastannin which may be harmful to one's health.""Speaker 1: But if the tea is good and well prepared, It will do much good.""Speaker 2: What good is it for?""Speaker 1: Not only can it appease one's thirst, But it can also refresh one when tired.""Speaker 2: That's true, But it must not be allowed to stand long.""Speaker 1: Why is it so?""Speaker 2: Sorry, I can't go today.""Speaker 1: How about tomorrow night?""Speaker 2: Ok. What time?""Speaker 1: Is 9:00 PM all right?""Speaker 2: I think that's too late.""Speaker 1: Is 6:00 PM OK?""Speaker 2: Yes, That's good. Where would you like to go?""Speaker 1: The Italian restaurant on 5th street.""Speaker 2: Oh, I don't like that Restaurant. I don't want to go there.""Speaker 1: How about the Korean restaurant next to it?""Speaker 2: Oh, He's 14 and in the past few months, He's become quieter and a bit secretive. He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. What makes you think that?""Speaker 2: Well, He's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band. And one night last weekend, He came home really late, Way past his curfew.""Speaker 1: Really? What happened?""Speaker 2: He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home.""Speaker 1: I see what you mean. I understand why you're concerned. Have you tried talking to your son about it?""Speaker 2: I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.""Speaker 1: You may be right, But it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life.""Speaker 2: You're right. I should talk to him. Sometimes, It's not easy being a parent. Thanks. It helps to get it off my chest. You're always so easy to talk to.""Speaker 2: That's great. I would love to. And when?""Speaker 1: Let's fix it at seven o'clock, Ok?""Speaker 2: No problem. However, Maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. I will arrange everything.""Speaker 2: All right, See you tonight.""Speaker 2: Let's meet in front of the train station.""Speaker 1: Ok great, I'll see you at six.""Speaker 2: Ok, Got it. I will call you sometime next week.""Speaker 1: Fine.""Speaker 2: It's time to go. Bye, Ella. Hope to see you soon.""Speaker 2: It's been 3 years now.""Speaker 1: How time flies! Now you are a college student out of a little girl.""Speaker 2: How is aunty Shirley?""Speaker 1: Couldn't be better.""Speaker 2: How has May been?""Speaker 2: Oh, That's a nice idea. Well, It's fine if you take our picture.""Speaker 2: I'm glad that you think so. I thought it might be a bit too revealing.""Speaker 1: No, Not at all. It looks really classy on you. Where did you pick that up?""Speaker 2: I got it on sale down at the department store.""Speaker 1: When did you go there?""Speaker 2: I was just there a couple of days ago. You know, You should go down there too. They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale.""Speaker 1: I might just do that. What style of clothes do they have?""Speaker 2: Anything you want. They have both casual and formal styles.""Speaker 1: I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Some of your ties are pretty outdated.""Speaker 1: Well, I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made, So I couldn't afford to buy any new ties.""Speaker 2: Anyways, Are you going to the party tonight?""Speaker 1: Yes, I am. Say, Are you going to wear that outfit to the party?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. It is a little too formal. I'm probably going to wear something more laid back.""Speaker 1: Me too. I will probably go dressed in aT-shirt and jeans.""Speaker 2: I guess that you will really be dressing down.""Speaker 1: That's my style when I'm not in the office.""Speaker 2: Oh, Nothing much really. And how is everything with you?""Speaker 1: Fine, Thanks. I've been busy lately.""Speaker 2: What have you been doing?""Speaker 1: I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month.""Speaker 2: Really? Good luck for them.""Speaker 1: Thanks. And how are your parents?""Speaker 2: They're both very well, Thanks.""Speaker 1: Where are you going now?""Speaker 2: I'm going to do some shopping. Why don't you come with me?""Speaker 1: I can't. I have to meet someone.""Speaker 2: It's been nice talking to you.""Speaker 2: What time is your appointment?""Speaker 1: It is at 8 o'clock.""Speaker 2: What time is now? Do you have the correct time?""Speaker 1: I don't know what time it is.""Speaker 2: It must be about 6 o'clock.""Speaker 1: I have to go now. I don't want to be late.""Speaker 2: No, Tell me more.""Speaker 1: Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week.""Speaker 2: And.""Speaker 1: And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday, Fingers crossed.""Speaker 2: That's great news, Jeremy. Congratulations! Anyway, I must get back, But give my regards to your wife Monica.""Speaker 2: I wish I had been there!""Speaker 1: I like it, Too. But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music.""Speaker 2: I accidentally ripped the cover.""Speaker 1: You will need to pay for the damage.""Speaker 2: How much do I need to pay?""Speaker 1: I'm going to need $ 5. 00.""Speaker 2: That's not too expensive.""Speaker 1: It isn't.""Speaker 2: Here's the $ 5. 00.""Speaker 1: Thank you.""Speaker 2: How about going hunting with me?""Speaker 1: Wonderful.""Speaker 2: Okay. I'll pick you up around 6.""Speaker 2: I changed my strategy around too. I am investing in good companies now.""Speaker 1: Yes, I agree with you. I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon.""Speaker 2: It's a good idea. But please be careful when you invest this time.""Speaker 1: Yes, I will. I should learn more from you. After all I am green hand on it.""Speaker 2: If you have any question, You can ask me.""Speaker 1: Ok. My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now. I am leaving.""Speaker 2: All right. Let's chat next time. Bye-bye.""Speaker 2: Tomorrow morning.""Speaker 1: How long do you have to be there?""Speaker 2: Three days.""Speaker 1: When will you be back?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: And a white sports car.""Speaker 2: Um, That's good.""Speaker 2: What? You feel sorry for the butterflies?""Speaker 1: Yes. I think they should just let them fly free, And not try to sell them to foreigners. It is a kind of destruction of nature.""Speaker 2: Well, I agree with you. I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains. I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population.""Speaker 1: Who knows? Hey, I like these jade bears here.""Speaker 2: How much are they?""Speaker 1: This one is 2300 dollars. Maybe I should buy it for my mother. What do you think?""Speaker 2: If you want. Didn't you buy her a small vase already?""Speaker 1: Yes, But she would like this a lot. She likes to collect little things like this.""Speaker 2: Alright. Buy it then. I won't buy anything. Well, Maybe I'll buy some Cognac.""Speaker 1: Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother. He always drinks it.""Speaker 2: You got promoted?""Speaker 1: Well, It is not going to happen so soon, I guess.""Speaker 2: You won a lottery? Don't beat around the bush, Just tell me, Please.""Speaker 2: Let me take a look. Maybe I can figure it out.""Speaker 2: Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays, Especially the ones where he only played a bit part.""Speaker 1: I see. I'm sure you'll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.""Speaker 2: Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday.""Speaker 1: Are you a member of his fan club?""Speaker 2: I was, But then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, So I'm not a member now.""Speaker 1: Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month?""Speaker 2: Of course! I bought two copies.""Speaker 2: Orange juice.""Speaker 1: What would you like for lunch, Pork, Mutton or beef?""Speaker 2: I think mutton is best.""Speaker 1: What kind of drink do you like most, Red wine, Beer or champagne?""Speaker 2: I like champagne.""Speaker 1: And among apples, Oranges and bananas, Which is your favorite?""Speaker 2: Banana of course.""Speaker 1: Do you always have meals outside or in your house?""Speaker 2: I don't think I'Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic. He doesn't seem to like anything. Which kinds of paintings do you prefer?""Speaker 1: I like landscapes and still life. You prefer abstract paintings, Don't you?""Speaker 2: Yes, I do. I like painters who use will rather than watercolors. The colors appear richer. What do you think?""Speaker 1: I agree. I prefer oils too. I collect landscapes, But I only have a small collection. You have a small collection of abstract art, Don't you?""Speaker 2: Yes. Good artwork is very expensive nowadays. When I was in china, I bought some calligraphy by famous artists. You should come and see it sometime.""Speaker 1: That would be nice. Can you read the characters?""Speaker 2: I know what the characters on the paintings mean. I think Chinese characters look very artistic. It's said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist's character.""Speaker 2: Thank you for the invitation.""Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?""Speaker 2: Do you have clubs?""Speaker 1: No. Can I rent clubs?""Speaker 2: There are clubs for beginners. It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times.""Speaker 1: What kinds of clubs?""Speaker 2: Like the seven-piece set. It's only $ 120.""Speaker 1: I'll buy a set. But you have to teach me.""Speaker 2: Now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart.""Speaker 1: Oh, So he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, Then?""Speaker 2: Right now he speaks mostly English, And he can say a few Chinese words. But he will learn in the future.""Speaker 1: What does he look like? Can people tell?""Speaker 2: Today?""Speaker 1: Yes. I appreciate all help and in particular, All the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here.""Speaker 2: Don't mention it. I am pleased to help you.""Speaker 1: If there's anything that I can help you in the future, Please let me know.""Speaker 2: Yes. There is. It has several sections, So it's quite a read! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning.""Speaker 1: What section does it have?""Speaker 2: Let me see. There's the news section, The entertainment section, Sports, Business, And world affairs.""Speaker 1: What's in that section?""Speaker 2: World affairs? They look at the most important stories in more detail. I find it fascinating. Do you buy a daily paper?""Speaker 2: Well, Generally speaking, If you want to change someone's mind or understand his position, You have to put yourself in his shoes. Understand his need and the cost for his need. And then you work together to find a solution.""Speaker 1: Sounds easy. But how can I apply to practice? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill. But I am afraid our boss will turn me down.""Speaker 2: Oh, I've forgotten to tell you. The party is held every other week. And every family gives their own performance each time.""Speaker 1: My children would like that ; they like dancing very much.""Speaker 2: That's good!""Speaker 1: Look! Who is that guy on the stage?""Speaker 2: Oh, My God! That's my husband, Benjamin.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: He likes American Idol very much, And he always imitates the contestant at home. I can't believe he got on the stage himself.""Speaker 1: He performs very well. He is so funny!""Speaker 2: Ok, Just ignore him. I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community. After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family!""Speaker 1: Ok, That's perfect! By the way, Is there any playground in our neighborhood?""Speaker 2: Yes, There is one behind our building. And you can play tennis there. But if you want to play tennis there, They will change you 30 Yuan per hour.""Speaker 1: Ok, Got it! Thank you so much. You have helped me a lot!""Speaker 2: Yeah, It's really a unique experience. It's a solo concert by Pavarotti. He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing.""Speaker 1: I've heard of that one. It was also his swan song.""Speaker 2: Besides, Speaking of classical music, We should never forget about the New Year's Concert.""Speaker 1: Of course not. People all over the world watch it on TV, Or listen to it on the radio.""Speaker 2: Sure. It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events. Have you ever been to the live show?""Speaker 1: Yes, I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005.""Speaker 2: Wow, You are so lucky. I saw that one on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall.""Speaker 1: That's for sure. You know, It's really amazing to be in the best concert hall, Listening to the performance by the best orchestra. I had the greatest time ever.""Speaker 2: Who was the conductor at that event?""Speaker 1: Lorin Maazel. He did an amazing job. Moreover, He just celebrated his 75th birthday.""Speaker 2: So cool. I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future.""Speaker 1: The right opportunity for you would come along soon. You know, Music is transnational.""Speaker 2: You can park in the student parking structure.""Speaker 1: Where is it located?""Speaker 2: You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus.""Speaker 1: Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left?""Speaker 2: Last time I checked, It was pretty empty.""Speaker 1: What time was it when you went up there?""Speaker 2: That was earlier this morning.""Speaker 1: It wouldn't be full right now, Would it?""Speaker 2: It says here that most of the people are han Chinese, But there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population.""Speaker 1: We need to say something about the geography and climate of china. Is there any way to divide the country into sections?""Speaker 2: We could divide into five parts. There's the northeast, Which is mild in summer and very cold in winter. Then there is the northwest, Which is largely desert.Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate. The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts. One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer. Then, In the south it is hot most of the year.""Speaker 1: That sounds very general.""Speaker 2: It is, Buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation. We can select cities from each part and give data for each one.""Speaker 1: One from each part? Lhasa, Urumqi, Harbin, Shanghai, And hongkong. The capital city is Beijing, Right?""Speaker 2: Yes. The other large cities are Chengdu,Dalian, Wuhan,Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing. Hongkong and Guangzhou.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Well, I fill you in one the details later.""Speaker 2: Yeah but, It is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.""Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.""Speaker 2: I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, Find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, And that the place is hygienic.""Speaker 2: I'm not sure... Well, First, It couldn't be George. He is such a kiss-ass. He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked.""Speaker 1: No, It's not going to be George. I don't think it's Andy either. He is involved with the boss's sister in-law. And you know how whipped our boss is.""Speaker 2: That's true. What about Lisa? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her.""Speaker 1: Lisa? No way. I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair. You know rumors can't come out from nowhere.""Speaker 2: Well, Okay. Then there is still Michael. But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row. It definitely won't be Michael.""Speaker 1: No, That would be crazy. But then who will it be? Oh dear, It must be me. I should have known it! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing. What should I do? I've got a familyt.""Speaker 2: Sure. I get a lot of information and make many friends.""Speaker 2: You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this.""Speaker 1: Nancy, I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight.""Speaker 2: Too sudden! I'm not ready for it.""Speaker 1: Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments.""Speaker 2: Stop it. No more of that talk.""Speaker 1: I really love you.""Speaker 2: No, I shall faint.""Speaker 1: And I hope so. This is what you were meant for. Say you love me, Say yes, Say yes.""Speaker 2: Thank you. I appreciate the compliment.""Speaker 1: Your knowledge of English is really surprising.""Speaker 2: Oh, It's nothing to speak of.""Speaker 1: No, Seriously. I am impressed.""Speaker 2: Great, I like the idea of trying some new food.""Speaker 1: Good for you. Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world.""Speaker 2: Also some traditional Chinese food, Like noodles anddumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality. I heard this year, The government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control.""Speaker 2: Me too. Seems like all I do is eat and sleep.""Speaker 1: Gotta go. Call me tonight.""Speaker 2: I didn't know you were a twin! Are you identical or fraternal?""Speaker 1: We're identical. I mean, We look exactly the same, But we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else.""Speaker 2: Interesting. It must be great having a twin sister. Are you best friends, Too?""Speaker 1: We used to be really close, But that all changed once she moved to Shanghai. How about your family? You didn't mention to your biological father.""Speaker 2: I don't know much about him. He died when I was just a baby. Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother, I consider them to be my real family.""Speaker 1: What about your step-brother's mother? Does he keep in touch with her?""Speaker 2: No, She also died when my step-brother was little. My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends. They ended up getting married a few years later.""Speaker 2: Surely I want. It's quite popular nowadays.""Speaker 2: I'm going to help him.""Speaker 1: What's he doing?""Speaker 2: Really? I want to go, Too.""Speaker 1: Ok, Let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight. Don't be late.""Speaker 2: No problem.""Speaker 1: ( After watching the movie. ) Are you crying?""Speaker 2: I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie.""Speaker 1: Tragic movie? I think it's a love story.""Speaker 2: But their love is touching!""Speaker 1: Ah, You're just too emotional.""Speaker 2: Most anyway.""Speaker 1: Do you like playing table tennis?""Speaker 2: Yes, I like. But I can't play it well.""Speaker 1: Are indoor sports popular?""Speaker 2: Basketball and swimming are very popular.""Speaker 1: Really? I like playing basketball, Too.""Speaker 2: We can play together if you are free.""Speaker 2: It's wrong because---it isn't true.""Speaker 1: You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are, Don't you?""Speaker 2: Well, No-that is, I've heard Linda say they do, But... Thank you. But please don't speak to me again.""Speaker 2: Pretty much. The land rises and falls only a few meters. The southeast, The hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters. There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country.""Speaker 1: Yes, There are. They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries.""Speaker 2: The coast of your country is very varied. The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches.""Speaker 1: That doesn't sound too bad. Great for sunbathing! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers. There are cliffs, Then sandy beaches. Then rocks. There are lots of caves in the cliffs. There are also many small islands off the coast, But few people lives on them.""Speaker 2: There are many lakes and rivers in your country too. We also have many rivers, But only a few lakes.""Speaker 2: Not always. Sometimes we don't understand her. Then she has to repeat what she said.""Speaker 1: It must be interesting to study English.""Speaker 2: Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss. Parker says that my pronunciation is very good.""Speaker 1: Is English pronunciation easy or difficult?""Speaker 2: Well, You had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?""Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.""Speaker 2: Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?""Speaker 1: I'll make it up next week.""Speaker 2: Fine, But it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class.""Speaker 1: Ok, I can do that.""Speaker 2: There you go. How do you like it?""Speaker 1: I think it looks gorgeous.""Speaker 2: You think it looks nice?""Speaker 1: I honestly think it looks great.""Speaker 2: Thanks. I'm glad that I did a good job.""Speaker 1: How much is it for my hair?""Speaker 2: Just give me $ 55.""Speaker 1: Thanks for doing such a good job.""Speaker 2: Yes, I kept on typing it until midnight, But it is lost.""Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk?""Speaker 2: Yes, But there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk.""Speaker 1: How about the shelf?""Speaker 2: I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it?""Speaker 1: Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go.""Speaker 2: I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing?""Speaker 1: Cheer up! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week. There is no need to write a new one. Oh, What's this? Is this your dissertation?""Speaker 2: Let me see. Yes, That's it. Where did you find it?""Speaker 1: You'Ve put it among these journals.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm really worried about my grades. I didn't think this course would be so stressful.""Speaker 1: You're a good student. I'm sure you can do well. What you need to do is to relax.""Speaker 2: You're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time?""Speaker 1: Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress.""Speaker 2: I don't really have time to learn anything new. I need to spend my time studying!""Speaker 1: You need to take some breaks throughout the day. Studying all day isn't very usually effective.""Speaker 2: You're right. I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class.""Speaker 1: Besides, It's not difficult to learn yoga. In fact, I can teach you a move that's supposed to help you fall asleep! You just have to sit down like this, Bend over and breath in deeply.""Speaker 2: That's fantastic. I'm going to go try that out in my room now. Good night!""Speaker 2: It's huge!""Speaker 1: Yeah. They're usually this big.""Speaker 2: The craftsmanship is excellent.""Speaker 1: All the parts work.""Speaker 2: Thank you so much.""Speaker 1: You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun.""Speaker 2: Froth?""Speaker 1: If you want something manly, Stick with the espresso.""Speaker 2: I really appreciate you for having invited me.""Speaker 1: Don't mention it. You know, We're old friends.""Speaker 2: Anyway, I owe you one. Are you free tonight?""Speaker 1: Yes. Why?""Speaker 2: I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook.""Speaker 2: I'm glad you are getting better.""Speaker 1: And I was glad to receive your letter.""Speaker 2: Then when will you be back again?""Speaker 1: I will be back again next Wednesday.""Speaker 2: I hope to see you at that time again. Bye.""Speaker 2: He must be very brave.""Speaker 2: Tell him I hope he's better soon.""Speaker 2: Italian. They played very well, But they were not very lucky.""Speaker 2: Exactly. I'm too excited for Christmas morning. Also, I thought I heard Santa.""Speaker 1: Really? How do you know it was Santa?""Speaker 2: Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings, So I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies. I even left out some milk. I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, So I came downstairs!""Speaker 1: Hmm... Well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree, Spying on him!""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: Really! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed. That way, We can let Santa do his job. Then when you wake up, It will be Christmas already!""Speaker 2: O-K...""Speaker 2: Do you have a lot of homework?""Speaker 1: Yes. Don't you?""Speaker 2: Of course I do!""Speaker 1: Which class are you working on right now?""Speaker 2: I'm studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Are you in Mrs Green's class?""Speaker 2: Yes. Are you?""Speaker 1: Yes. We must have the same exam tomorrow!""Speaker 2: Do you want to study together?""Speaker 1: Sure. This library is too quiet though.""Speaker 2: Do you want to go to and empty classroom?""Speaker 1: That sounds good.""Speaker 2: That's true. Cycling is good for our environment, Too. Let me just get my helmet then.""Speaker 1: Is your helmet comfortable?""Speaker 2: Not really, But I liked the design, So I got it.""Speaker 1: Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better.""Speaker 2: I'll think about it.""Speaker 1: Is that your new bicycle?""Speaker 2: Yes, My father gave it to me for my birthday. Do you like it?""Speaker 1: It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive!""Speaker 2: Nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky.""Speaker 1: I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it?""Speaker 2: Well, My saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?""Speaker 1: That's easy. It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle.""Speaker 2: Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike?""Speaker 2: That's too bad.""Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality.""Speaker 2: Thanks for coming.""Speaker 1: How about next time we meet at my place? And I'll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise.""Speaker 2: Great idea. I'm looking forward to it. See you then.""Speaker 1: Well. I really do have to go.""Speaker 2: Good night then.""Speaker 2: ... And maybe that's what we both need.""Speaker 1: I need to come to grips with his death first. And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow.""Speaker 2: But everything has been so easy.""Speaker 1: Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned! That may be true, But if you were to do it, You would have trouble on the horizon. You always say that.""Speaker 2: Yeah, You never look at the positive side of things.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's Janice. She's just new in town. You have a thing for blonds, Eh?""Speaker 2: Yeah! She could do anything she wants to me!""Speaker 1: I bet. Why not go over and talk to her? She's really nice.""Speaker 2: I don't think so. I get so nervous talking to girls. I always put my foot in my mouth, Scare her off, And end up looking like a real fool. Besides, She is way out of my league.""Speaker 1: Come on! Man up! You'll never know until you try.""Speaker 2: Okay okay, Just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game.""Speaker 1: All right. But I think you ought to move soon.""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: I can see five other guys eying her up.""Speaker 2: Okay, Here I go!""Speaker 2: Only for this reason?""Speaker 1: Yes, I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad.""Speaker 2: Don't worry about it. Practice makes perfect. I will lend you some listening materials, So that you can practise more before the exam. I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation.""Speaker 2: Thanks a lot. I hope to see you again.""Speaker 1: I hope so, Too.""Speaker 2: Thanks again for everything you have done for me.""Speaker 2: It's not as bad as that... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers. Besides, Didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning?""Speaker 1: What's that?""Speaker 2: Actually, I was happy just to get the book published. Winning the prize was an added bonus.""Speaker 1: What was the prize?""Speaker 2: I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice.""Speaker 1: That's a great prize for a person who writes books! Have you ever won a prize before?""Speaker 2: I shared a prize with some friends last week. We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes! I completely forgot about it.""Speaker 1: Did you have a fight with Jack?""Speaker 2: No, But now he'll be in trouble. What's a boyfriend for? To forget about Valentine's Day?""Speaker 1: Come on, Dear! You forgot it, Too.""Speaker 2: You know, It's OK for a girl to forget these \"big days\", But for a guy, To do that is unforgivable.""Speaker 1: Is that your phone?""Speaker 2: Oh, It's Jack. Excuse me.""Speaker 1: Wow! Good timing.""Speaker 2: He asked me out to a dinner tonight. How about joining us?""Speaker 1: Come on! Three's a crowd!""Speaker 2: So what?""Speaker 2: Whatever... Smell! Perfume samples!""Speaker 1: Nice. Hey, I like the layout of this page...""Speaker 2: I enjoy the various characters and the plot.""Speaker 1: Well. I like the Thom Birds best.""Speaker 2: Is it very interesting?""Speaker 1: Sure. I like the writer's language, Too.""Speaker 2: If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book.""Speaker 1: Would you like to go to the bookshop with me?""Speaker 2: Xu spikes it! Wow, What a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in!""Speaker 1: It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, Oh, And we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.""Speaker 2: My major is English. Of course I'll apply for an English teacher.""Speaker 1: Oh. That dress doesn't exactly match the job.""Speaker 2: Why? You said my skirt was beautiful just now.""Speaker 1: Yes, Your skirt is really beautiful, But you are applying for a teaching position. You see, Your skirt is very short, And your make up is too thick. What's more, The color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin. As a teacher, You should be a little more sedate.""Speaker 2: Then what should I do?""Speaker 2: Women have often played an important role in British history. Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588. More recently, Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980's.""Speaker 1: She was a very controversial leader. Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later?""Speaker 2: There's a lot to see there. Perhaps we should go tomorrow.""Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison. Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past. I really want to see the crown jewels too.""Speaker 2: I'Ve seen them before. They're quite incredible. If you want to see historical figures in London, There's one place you have to go.""Speaker 1: Where's that? Oh, I know! MadameTussaud's the waxworks museum.""Speaker 2: There you can see british leaders, Entertainers, Criminals, And royalty.""Speaker 2: It's not that bad. You probably just had a bad experience once.""Speaker 1: It wasn't just once. Every single time I take the bus, Something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.""Speaker 2: We could take the subway, But we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.""Speaker 1: Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, Too.""Speaker 2: If we don't hurry up, We'll miss the show. Should we take the bus?""Speaker 1: We're already late, So I think we had better take a taxi.""Speaker 2: I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours. Let's just take the bus.""Speaker 1: Fine. Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives.""Speaker 2: It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. Nothing bad will happen. I'll even buy your ticket for you.""Speaker 2: Thanks, That was nice of you.""Speaker 2: When's he coming?""Speaker 1: He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth. He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth.""Speaker 2: Let me look at the calendar. Good! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday. Is he coming alone?""Speaker 1: No, He's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls.""Speaker 2: Mother, I don't remember the girls. How old are they?""Speaker 1: Your cousin Fay is fifteen. Rosemary is older than Fay. She's seventeen.""Speaker 2: Are they going to stay here with us?""Speaker 1: Of course. The girls can stay in your room with you.""Speaker 2: Mother, May we have a party?""Speaker 1: If you like, But now we have to think about meals and many other things.""Speaker 2: Oh, No, The guy was a musician who just sang. He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs. Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor. He sang for appreciation, But not for money.""Speaker 1: It is just pop song, You could have sung there too if you want it.""Speaker 2: Oh, No, It was a kind of pop art. I like it but I couldn't do it that well.""Speaker 1: Honey, Just do it next time. Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia?""Speaker 2: No, But tell me some. I am interested.""Speaker 1: Many oil painting exhibitions are there. That is a kind of Museum Exhibition.""Speaker 2: Are there many people there? Do you think people actually like them?""Speaker 1: I am sure you will. There are some works, And some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors. And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train.""Speaker 2: But I still prefer the pop music in the subway.""Speaker 1: Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts, But with different aesthetic values.""Speaker 2: Dad, You talk well, But can you appreciate that kind of art?""Speaker 2: Sure. Did you hear anything? Look! An eagle is hovering in the sky.""Speaker 1: Let me see. It's not an eagle. I think it's a vulture.""Speaker 2: Yes. Will it hurt us?""Speaker 1: I don't think so. Let's walk by the stream. I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map.""Speaker 2: Ok. I have a good pair of hiking boots. It should not be a big problem.""Speaker 1: I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions. If you are hungry, You can let me know.""Speaker 2: You are kind. Look there is a big tree over there, It looks like a thousand-year-old tree.""Speaker 1: Well, It is a birch tree. It is not as old as you think.""Speaker 2: How do you know?""Speaker 2: Yeah. I know.""Speaker 1: I want to know where this relationship is going. I'm in love with you and I need to know...""Speaker 2: You know, I think you're awesome.""Speaker 1: I'm awesome. Well, I guess that's my answer, Isn't it.""Speaker 2: Honey...""Speaker 1: Look, If you don't love me, It's not a thing, Alright, We'Ve had our laughs, But I don't appreciate... Maybe it's just time we...""Speaker 2: Baby, I love you so much.""Speaker 1: You do?""Speaker 2: I love you. And I think you're awesome.""Speaker 1: Oh, I love you too!""Speaker 2: Come on. Put the gun down.""Speaker 2: I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption. I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since.""Speaker 1: That's great. Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now?""Speaker 2: Definitely. I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables, Which is more expensive, But much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them.""Speaker 1: You've really turned into a health nut, Haven't you?""Speaker 2: I guess you could say that. Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy. I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great!""Speaker 1: How do you get enough protein in your diet?""Speaker 2: Well, I eat a lot more tofu, Beans, Nuts and some fish.""Speaker 1: Well, Don't worry about dinner. I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you. Do you like sushi?""Speaker 2: I prefer cooked fish to raw fish, But if you really like it, Make it.""Speaker 1: How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry?""Speaker 2: That sounds great. What time should I come over?""Speaker 1: Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm, So you can come over at 7 p.M.""Speaker 2: How's your father?""Speaker 1: He's fine. He retired last week. It's turning going in his life. Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement.""Speaker 2: He can spend more time with his grandchildren.""Speaker 1: Oh, I don't think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world.""Speaker 2: So, He wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea!""Speaker 1: How do you want to spend your old age?""Speaker 2: Are you also going to Beijing?""Speaker 1: Yes, On a business trip. How about Yuu?""Speaker 2: I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there. Have you ever been there before?""Speaker 1: Yes, I Went there once last summer.""Speaker 2: Really? What did you think?""Speaker 1: I think it is amazing. You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway.""Speaker 2: Was it that crowded?""Speaker 1: Yes. These were always so many people. After taking the subway during the rush hour, You'll envysardines in their cans.""Speaker 2: Oh, Maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea. Wish you a great vacation!""Speaker 2: I will think about it.""Speaker 2: That's true. For various reasons, It takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics. You know, The low temperature may cause many problems.""Speaker 1: Yeah. What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics?""Speaker 2: When the Olympic Games started in modern times, Only summer events were included. When it grew popular, There came the Winter Olympic Games, Which includes a variety of winter sports.""Speaker 1: I see. Then, What's your favorite winter sport?""Speaker 2: Figure skating. In my eye, Nothing beats it.""Speaker 1: Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo.""Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't expect you to know them. But yes, I love them not only because of many medals they've won, But also because of their spirits.""Speaker 1: You should go to talk with May. She is a big fan of them too.""Speaker 2: Sure. What about you? What do you like about the Olympics?""Speaker 1: For me, The Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart. It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible.""Speaker 2: Hey, Young man, You are so deep today.""Speaker 2: I know that. I mean I couldn't understand her at all.""Speaker 1: Me neither. All I have to do is study French hard.""Speaker 2: I have some problem with my work.""Speaker 1: Is it serious?""Speaker 2: I can solve it, Thanks.""Speaker 1: How about your family?""Speaker 2: I'd like to, But I'm afraid I can't.""Speaker 1: Why? Do you have to prepare for your examination? Oh, Come on, Girl, Relaxation is also very important.""Speaker 2: That's not the reason. I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening. You know, I've been going there every week.""Speaker 1: Oh, God, I've forgotten it.""Speaker 2: You said you wanted to improve your English, So how about coming with me tomorrow? I can also introduce some friends to you.""Speaker 1: Oh, No, I don't want to know any more geeks like you.""Speaker 2: They are not geeks. They are also interested in singing, Dancing, And so on. They are excellent, And they can always help me a lot.""Speaker 1: Really? Is there a foreign teacher for every class?""Speaker 2: It depends. If they are not busy, They will come to join us, And talk with us.""Speaker 1: So you just talk all the time?""Speaker 2: Of course not. The foreign teachers also teach us English songs, And play games with us.""Speaker 1: That sounds interesting. I'll go with you tomorrow evening.""Speaker 2: I'll be very glad if you would help.""Speaker 1: I'd like to wish you every success in your new venture.""Speaker 2: Thank you. I wish I would.""Speaker 2: Yt looks good on the outside, But the inside is a different story. It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again.""Speaker 1: What's wrong with it?""Speaker 2: Well, First of all, It needs a new engine, Which is extremely expensive.""Speaker 1: When's the last time you had it serviced?""Speaker 2: It must have been a few years ago now.""Speaker 1: I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.""Speaker 2: They do. Once my son was born, There was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, You know!""Speaker 1: What else is wrong with it?""Speaker 2: The heating controls don't work anymore, So it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer!""Speaker 1: Anything else?""Speaker 2: The brakes don't really work that well anymore either.""Speaker 1: Why don't you get it all fixed?""Speaker 2: It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it!""Speaker 2: No, It's not far. It's near our old house.""Speaker 1: Can I help you pack?""Speaker 2: That's a notebook?""Speaker 1: Believe it!""Speaker 2: You said it.""Speaker 1: This city is really comfortable to live in.""Speaker 2: It sure is.""Speaker 1: No other city can match it. It's heaven.""Speaker 2: Well, If you live in other cities as long as enough, You will love them just as much.""Speaker 1: Maybe.""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm leaving at four pm.""Speaker 1: Good, Well we can discuss this more then, But I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter.""Speaker 2: Yes, Me too.""Speaker 2: Don't tell me you actually believe all that? Don't be so gullible, They are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to scare you.""Speaker 1: Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that?""Speaker 2: You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don't be so naive!""Speaker 1: Well maybe you are right, But how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster!""Speaker 2: What's the big deal? It's just a picture of some woman.""Speaker 1: I'Ve seen it so many times in books, But I never imagined I'd get to see it in person.""Speaker 2: There are tons of other paintings that I think are better.""Speaker 1: Maybe so, But do you have any idea how much this one is worth?""Speaker 2: No, How much is it worth?""Speaker 1: About 80 million dollars.""Speaker 2: 27th day of the fourth month.""Speaker 1: By the way, Could you tell me when the film will begin?""Speaker 2: It will begin at 5 thirty.""Speaker 1: I am frigid I can't be there on time.""Speaker 2: You can see it tomorrow.""Speaker 1: I don't want to miss it today.""Speaker 2: See you.""Speaker 2: He is really great. He has sold millions of records worldwide. He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World.""Speaker 1: I heard one observer even said 'It was a song sung in Spanish for international football, And he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it.'.""Speaker 2: Not some crazy diet fat I hope.""Speaker 1: No no, I just changed my eating habits. I eat a balance meal. And I eat less than before.""Speaker 2: His mom and dad must be destroyed. He was their only son.""Speaker 1: And he was so young, With so much life to look forward to.""Speaker 2: Yes... Thank you for understanding. We have to go now.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Many times. Many times. When I was younger, You used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities.""Speaker 1: Oh, Really.Mm! How much is the fare?""Speaker 2: Well, It depends on the journey. It's .. I guess it's not too expensive, But the minimum price you would pay is, For a short journey, Is about a pound.""Speaker 1: Mm, Yeah, Who can you see on the bus? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting?""Speaker 2: Hmm, Yeah, Well this girl here at the back, That's leaning on the door, Um, She looks really bored, Actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go!""Speaker 1: Is that how you feel on the bus?""Speaker 2: Uh, Well, No, Not really, Because I haven't worked in England for a long time, So I haven't taken a bus for a long time.""Speaker 1: So, So you're British, Do you missing them?""Speaker 2: Well, I'm under a lot of pressure. My boss is very pushy. He assigned me two projects. Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them.""Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do for you?""Speaker 2: Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress.""Speaker 2: I agree. He is also an excellent speaker.""Speaker 1: Yes, He is. Of course he makes mistakes, But who doesn't.""Speaker 2: Do we have enough time?""Speaker 1: Yes, We do.""Speaker 2: The performance is excellent.""Speaker 1: It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great.""Speaker 2: I couldn't agree more.""Speaker 1: Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert?""Speaker 2: Yes, It is.""Speaker 1: Do you have concert halls in your city?""Speaker 2: Yes, But it's much smaller.""Speaker 1: Well, We'd better get back to our seats. It's about to start.""Speaker 2: That's a thought. It's still early, And the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day. If we don't stay too long, We won't get sunburned.""Speaker 1: Yeah, Sounds like fun. I can wear my new pink bikini.""Speaker 2: There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are.""Speaker 1: Who cares! Well, The smart guys get there early. That's the kind of guy I want to meet. Let's go!""Speaker 2: If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini, Then I want to wear one, Too.""Speaker 1: Ok, You could borrow one of mine.""Speaker 2: Thanks, How about the green and black one?""Speaker 2: It's beautiful 75 degrees.""Speaker 1: How nice. I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week. I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend.""Speaker 2: Not a good plan. The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend, And the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees.""Speaker 1: What a nuisance! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping, A storm comes along. The sky gets dark, The wind starts to howl and the temperature drops. Well, I'd better stay home.""Speaker 2: I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning. Then after listening to the weather temperature, I make my plans.""Speaker 2: That's true. Cycling is good for our environment, Too. Let me just get my helmet then.""Speaker 1: Is your helmet comfortable?""Speaker 2: Not really, But I liked the design, So I got it.""Speaker 1: Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better.""Speaker 2: I'll think about it.""Speaker 1: Is that your new bicycle?""Speaker 2: Yes, My father gave it to me for my birthday. Do you like it?""Speaker 1: It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive!""Speaker 2: Nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky.""Speaker 1: I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it?""Speaker 2: Well, My saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?""Speaker 1: That's easy. It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle.""Speaker 2: Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike?""Speaker 2: Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Sir. Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage, At twenty kilograms each, Plus one piece of carry-on luggage. I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.""Speaker 2: What? Why! I am taking an intercontinental flight! I'm flying sixteen thousand CMS! How am I supposed to only take two, Twenty kilo bags? That's absurd!""Speaker 1: I am sorry, Sir, There's nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that large bag either. Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big.""Speaker 2: Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, But when it comes to charging for any other small thing, You charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, Miss, How much will I have to pay for all of this.""Speaker 1: Let's see... Six hundred and twenty-five US dollars.""Speaker 2: Oh, I have been with my uncle for a week.""Speaker 1: What's he doing?""Speaker 2: He is an accountant. I have been helping him for a week.""Speaker 1: He must be happy.""Speaker 2: Yeah. How are you these days?""Speaker 2: Why is that?""Speaker 1: Well, I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work.""Speaker 2: Yes. I've been to New York. I got back only yesterday.""Speaker 1: Did you enjoy yourself?""Speaker 2: Very much. New York is such a nice place. Shall I show you some photographs?""Speaker 1: Thanks, I like looking at photographs. How nice! Oh, I'm afraid I must be going now. I've got an appointment. Have a good day.""Speaker 2: You too. I hope to see you soon. Goodbye.""Speaker 2: Oh. Yes, I'm ready to transfer.""Speaker 1: You're not nervous, Are you?""Speaker 2: I'm very nervous.""Speaker 1: Why are you nervous?""Speaker 2: I'm not going to know anybody there.""Speaker 1: That's not a problem.""Speaker 2: That makes me nervous.""Speaker 1: It's fun meeting new people.""Speaker 2: Yes. It was very cold and windy. We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm.""Speaker 1: It's so nice and quiet in the woods.""Speaker 2: Yes. Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere. We counted over twenty squirrels.""Speaker 1: It sounds wonderful. Did you take lunch with you?""Speaker 2: I don't think it's worth that money.""Speaker 2: Surely it was, Especially when you only knew few people and little English.""Speaker 1: You mean you didn't know much English then?""Speaker 2: Right. I only knew a few English sentences.""Speaker 1: That's incredible. Could you tell me what you did to make a start?""Speaker 2: First, I worked as a servant.""Speaker 1: Really? I wish you could tell me more about your experience.""Speaker 2: From the numbers, It seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines, But from our circular insert. That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format. Based on these findings, I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future!""Speaker 1: You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information. What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media?""Speaker 2: Ok. This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change.""Speaker 1: I've got the correct change already.""Speaker 2: First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars have to be smooth.""Speaker 1: Ok, What next?""Speaker 2: Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again.""Speaker 1: Ok, Next?""Speaker 2: Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.""Speaker 1: I agree with you.""Speaker 2: Come on, Sit down, And let me have a look.""Speaker 1: The pain is killing me.""Speaker 2: I told you to wear running shoes. But you don't listen.""Speaker 1: I thought leather shoes will do just as well.""Speaker 2: Hold on, Don't move, I will take care of that.""Speaker 1: What are you going to do?""Speaker 2: I will get some ice, And put it on your ankle. How does that feel?""Speaker 1: God! It's freezing!""Speaker 2: Well, My mother came from a big family, And wanted to have one of her own. My father was an only child, And didn't really care about having a large family, But my mother talked him into it.""Speaker 1: Jeez, Seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.""Speaker 2: It can be hard, And there are certain sacrifices you have to make.""Speaker 1: Like what? I assume that there's no privacy.""Speaker 2: That's one. Another is the lack of personal property. Everything you have, From toys to clothes, Is used by your brothers and sisters. Especially clothes. Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs.""Speaker 1: And the age gap is also annoying. There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.""Speaker 2: Same problem here. There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.""Speaker 1: Well, At least going to college won't be too bad. Since both of your parents are college professors, They must give you reduced tuition at the college.""Speaker 2: It was long, Too.""Speaker 1: I think it was about 45 minutes long.""Speaker 2: But it went by fast. It was interesting.""Speaker 1: I liked it.""Speaker 2: I'll give you a speech like that, Too.""Speaker 1: Do you think anyone will come to my funeral?""Speaker 2: Of course.""Speaker 1: I think only the family will be there.""Speaker 2: I'Ve got two tickets for a newly released film. Would you like to see it with me?""Speaker 1: Sure. What time?""Speaker 2: The film will start at 2.""Speaker 1: Sounds good. Where and when will we meet?""Speaker 2: In my parking lot, At 2pm.""Speaker 2: Yes. If she doesn't believe it, Christmas won't be so exciting to her.""Speaker 1: When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist?""Speaker 2: Don't worry. You don't have to do anything. All you have to do is listen. You will enjoy it.""Speaker 1: Maybe. I know I agreed to go with you, But now I don't feel right about it.""Speaker 2: Listen, Ryan. Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church. You don't have to pretend to be Catholic. It's okay if you just come to listen.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: Yes. We are kind and welcoming people. It is not a secret society or something like that.""Speaker 1: Alright. But will we sing?""Speaker 2: Yes, But you don't even have to sing. If you want to sing along, You can.""Speaker 1: I don't know the words.""Speaker 2: There is a songbook. All the words are in the songbook. Many people have to read the words.""Speaker 1: And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine?""Speaker 2: No. That is something only true Catholics do. So if you come to the church as a visitor, You only listen to the service. But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine. Only after someone joins the church, Then they go up for the Eucharist.""Speaker 1: Eu-char-ist? What is that?""Speaker 2: That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine. The Catholics call it the Eucharist.""Speaker 1: It doesn't sound like an English word.""Speaker 2: It's not. It's an ancient Greek word. It means gratitude.""Speaker 1: Alright. Well, I feel more comfortable now. Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor.""Speaker 2: I don't know if I would call it my favorite, But it ranks up there.""Speaker 1: What class was your favorite then?""Speaker 2: I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific.""Speaker 2: Actually, It suggest English. The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, And japan. So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful. The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language. Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English.""Speaker 1: Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?""Speaker 2: The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost, But others will continue to be used for generation, Even if English continues to be the dominant language.""Speaker 1: Right. All the people who speak Chinese. Hindi, French and Spanish aren't suddenly going to stop using those languages.""Speaker 2: Exactly. The article suggests that those languages will be used, But that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers.""Speaker 2: Oh, It's so quiet here. We have the park to ourselves, Only you and me!""Speaker 1: Don't you see many people over there? Just on your left.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see them. Some are doing Taijiquan, Some are performing swordplay, Some are practising the Chinese Wushu.""Speaker 2: It must be old.""Speaker 1: At least more than 100 years old.""Speaker 2: Let's enter it!""Speaker 1: I can't open the door.""Speaker 2: It must be locked.""Speaker 1: Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.""Speaker 2: She can't answer you.""Speaker 1: She must be deaf.""Speaker 2: It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?""Speaker 2: Not really. But I like it in spring and fall. I don't like it in winter.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day.""Speaker 1: What about the weather in Boston?""Speaker 2: I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter.""Speaker 1: Is it very cold in winter?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have too much work to do at the moment.""Speaker 1: Why's that?""Speaker 2: 1:30 P.M. But I've got to check in at 12:30 P.M.""Speaker 1: What airline and what flight?""Speaker 2: Pan American Airlines. Flight 282.""Speaker 1: I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P.M.""Speaker 2: Hi. My name is Jessica.""Speaker 1: Nice to meet you.""Speaker 2: Pleased to meet you too. And where are you from, Robin?""Speaker 1: I'm from Kathmandu. What about you?""Speaker 2: I'm from New York. Oh, This is my stop. Bye, Robin.""Speaker 2: In No. 4Dorm. I like dorm life. You will meet a lot of people and you don't have to cook. What about you?""Speaker 1: Oh, I am looking for an apartment. I prefer living off campus. I can study better.""Speaker 2: I hope you will find a place. Listen, I'd better go. I am going to be late for class.""Speaker 1: Okay, See you around.""Speaker 2: I don't know. Maybe they are really crazy.""Speaker 2: I'm worrying about how to move all of my household stuff. You know, I have a lot of stuff.""Speaker 1: You can call amover.""Speaker 2: How much dose that cost?""Speaker 1: Around 200 RIB for a truck.""Speaker 2: I think it's a little expensive.""Speaker 1: But think about it, You just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers, How much trouble you will save.""Speaker 2: That's right.""Speaker 1: I know amover which has a very good reputation for their service. I'll leave you their phone number.""Speaker 2: Wonderful.""Speaker 1: It's 8357688 8.""Speaker 2: Okay, Thanks a lot. You did me a great favor just now.""Speaker 2: Is her fiance Taiwanese?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: How old is he?""Speaker 2: Very well, Thank you. I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve. Would you care to join us?""Speaker 2: He's huge! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that.""Speaker 2: I don't mind, But I like girls with long hair.""Speaker 1: We have different tastes. I like girls with short hair. I like tall girls - probably because I'm so tall myself.""Speaker 2: Have you ever dated a girl taller than you?""Speaker 1: No, Never. I don't think I'Ve ever met a girl taller than me! Have you gained weight recently?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have. Perhaps I should go to the gym, Like that girl's boyfriend.""Speaker 2: No, Thanks.""Speaker 1: Well, I hope you'll feel better soon.""Speaker 2: Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, But Mary's short hand is the best in her class.""Speaker 1: How about languages?""Speaker 2: Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does.""Speaker 2: Well, To be frank, Yes, I do.""Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. But this isn't a no-smoker, Isn't it? I mean would you mind if I smoke here?""Speaker 2: Actually it is. Perhaps you haven't noticed the sign.""Speaker 1: Sign? What's sign?""Speaker 2: There, On the window.""Speaker 1: Oh, Sorry. I didn't notice it. Sorry.""Speaker 2: Yes. I commute five days a week by train.""Speaker 1: And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service?""Speaker 2: It's really very good.""Speaker 1: Why do you say that?""Speaker 2: Well, Trains are frequent and come on time.""Speaker 1: Which train do you catch in the evening?""Speaker 2: I usually take the five thirty home.""Speaker 1: And can you get a seat?""Speaker 2: No, I usually have to stand.""Speaker 1: Would you agree that the service is fast?""Speaker 2: Sixty-five? What the...? How did you bargain him down, Wei? You've never even been to a flea market before!""Speaker 1: It must be my special touch. I think bargaining is in my blood!""Speaker 2: Well. I'm rather disappointed with it.""Speaker 1: How come?""Speaker 2: It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected.""Speaker 1: Oh. It's awful, But it can't be helped.""Speaker 2: Do you have any ketchup?""Speaker 2: It's hard to say. I mean, How can you judge what's good for them? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is.""Speaker 1: But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth.""Speaker 2: Studying in the university is not easy, But it's not as arduous as you think.""Speaker 1: How do you know that? You haven't got in yet.""Speaker 2: Of course I know. I once attended Lisa's class, Sitting quietly at the back of the classroom.""Speaker 1: Oh, Really? Were you not caught?""Speaker 2: Of course not. You are allowed to attend any lecture, Only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class. In universities, You study in a free and creative environment.""Speaker 1: What do you want to study in the university? Have you thought about it?""Speaker 2: This question has really been bothering me. I like Chinese literature, You know. But economics is really hot now, And it has a very good career prospect.""Speaker 1: I will choose what I like. You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English, Because I don't like English.""Speaker 2: Though I like Chinese literature very much, I'm also interested in economics. It's a tough choice to make.""Speaker 1: You can decide later. You will have choices before you submit your university application form.""Speaker 2: He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers, But what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand.""Speaker 1: Maybe he is not good at rebounding?""Speaker 2: Indeed, No man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard.Rebounding might not be his strong suit.""Speaker 1: Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics. Did you go to the match between China and USA?""Speaker 2: Who wouldn't! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him.""Speaker 1: Well then, What are your spoils?""Speaker 2: I don't think you guys have it.""Speaker 1: You should look it up on our computer.""Speaker 2: I did that.""Speaker 1: What came up?""Speaker 2: It should be on the shelf, But I didn't see it.""Speaker 1: I can try to get the book from a different library.""Speaker 2: I didn't know you could do that.""Speaker 1: I will call you when I find it.""Speaker 2: I don't think much of the film.""Speaker 1: I think it is the worst one I have ever seen.""Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure I agree with you. It was not a good one, But it was not the worst one. Actually, It wasn't too bad.""Speaker 1: I can't think the same.""Speaker 2: What's more, Some scenes were good, Much fit for the children.""Speaker 2: Cookouts often start slowly. A two o 'clock start means you arrive any time after two.""Speaker 1: Thanks for telling me this.""Speaker 2: I was late getting back from the mall, But I'm hurrying.""Speaker 1: Why are you in such a hurry? They said, Dinner at eight, And it's only seven-fifteen. I don't want to be the first one there again.""Speaker 2: But I often skip his classes, And he doesn't like me.""Speaker 1: I hope you'll do better in the final.""Speaker 2: No, I'm not. What are you planning to do?""Speaker 1: I'm going to see a musical. Would you like to come?""Speaker 2: Sure, I'd love to! But let me pay for the tickets this time. It's my turn.""Speaker 2: Your clock never works. Perhaps you should buy a new one.""Speaker 1: Well. If it breaks down again tomorrow, I'll definitely buy a new one.""Speaker 2: Maybe by then it will be too late.""Speaker 1: What do you mean too late?""Speaker 2: I work in a publishing house. How about you?""Speaker 1: Mine isn't hard, But it's not interesting.""Speaker 2: What do you do then?""Speaker 2: I checked it already.""Speaker 1: Do we have it available?""Speaker 2: It wasn't there.""Speaker 1: I guess it is lost.""Speaker 2: Will you be getting another copy?""Speaker 1: Yes, We will.""Speaker 2: Could you reserve a copy for me?""Speaker 1: I can do that.""Speaker 2: Ok. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars ready?""Speaker 1: Yeah, So far, So good.""Speaker 2: Next, You feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are smooth.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I already knew that.""Speaker 2: I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, You might have tore-feed it.""Speaker 1: Ok, Let's move on!""Speaker 2: Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, Try again or call the number on the side of the machine.""Speaker 1: I hope it works!""Speaker 2: Well, Since my husband and I are from two different countries, And we live in a third country, We decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive.""Speaker 1: Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?""Speaker 2: I would have liked them to be there, But they couldn't afford to fly out to see us, And we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, So they understood.""Speaker 1: Did your husband's family get to meet your family?""Speaker 2: My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown, So that was great. Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions, But we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family.""Speaker 1: That makes sense. Did you go on a honeymoon?""Speaker 2: We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa.""Speaker 1: You really didn't have a very traditional wedding, Did you?""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.""Speaker 2: I don't agree, But anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself.""Speaker 1: What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It's pointless.""Speaker 2: Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.""Speaker 1: What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.""Speaker 2: Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday!""Speaker 2: Yes, We had a good time. The trip was terrific. We toured the Three Gorges by boat. Its realty exciting!""Speaker 1: Did your boat float down the river?""Speaker 2: Yes. There are many places where the gorge is very narrow, With steep cliffs on both sides.""Speaker 1: Sounds dangerous.""Speaker 2: Yes, But we have life jackets. And we got a real kick out of that.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Please give my regards to him.""Speaker 2: That's the funny thing. I don't what's wrong with me. I just feel exhausted.""Speaker 1: Perhaps you'Ve been working too hard. You do have a high-pressure job.""Speaker 2: Maybe. I haven't been able to keep my food down either. That's unusual.""Speaker 1: Well. I'm sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again. Dr. Jameson is very good.""Speaker 2: Yes, He is. I'Ve make an appointment for 10 o' clock, So I'd better move along.""Speaker 2: Small and exquisite in size, Easy to operate, Foldable and easy to carry are its charms.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see.""Speaker 1: Come on, Dear. I know you mustn't forget it.""Speaker 2: It's Saturday, A great weekend.""Speaker 1: Ur, You really let me down.""Speaker 2: Don't be angry with me. I have a bad memory.""Speaker 1: No, You haven't. You just don't care about me. You're an indifferent husband.""Speaker 2: What day is it on earth?""Speaker 2: Oh, I see.""Speaker 1: Come on, Dear. I know you mustn't forget it.""Speaker 2: It's Saturday, A great weekend.""Speaker 1: Ur, You really let me down.""Speaker 2: Don't be angry with me. I have a bad memory.""Speaker 1: No, You haven't. You just don't care about me. You're an indifferent husband.""Speaker 2: What day is it on earth?""Speaker 2: Yes, I did. I have never tasted anything like this.""Speaker 1: Would you like some more rice?""Speaker 2: No, Thanks. I'm full.""Speaker 1: Another piece of meat pie?""Speaker 2: No, Thanks. I'm on diet.""Speaker 1: How about the dessert?""Speaker 2: How did you like the movie?""Speaker 1: I thought it was pretty good.""Speaker 2: I can't say I agree.""Speaker 1: You're kidding. The storyline and acting were outstanding.""Speaker 2: I guess I expected too much from the movie, So I was a bit disappointed.""Speaker 2: Of course not! We built a snowman, Some snow dogs and one big snow fort. We went sliding on the nice hill. It was a real work out. At noon, We had the most special winter picnic outside. Fortunately, We got it all on a video tape. You must come with us next time. I bet you will love it.""Speaker 2: Not exactly, Except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate. I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail. It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life.""Speaker 1: What did it say about you then?""Speaker 2: For example, The message for the day before yesterday notified me that I, As a Leo guy, Was to have some \"unusual experience in food and drink. And as it turned out, The reality matched this prediction well. Lasi night, I was treated to a dinner party by Mr. Lee.""Speaker 1: But it must have been only a coincidence. That's the only way superstition wins over science.""Speaker 2: Oh, No. You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud. If horoscope is really something deceptive, How come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it.""Speaker 2: That's a hard time. The air is cold and damp, And the road is often icy.""Speaker 1: It's boring, Right?""Speaker 2: Sure.""Speaker 1: Do you get much rain during the summer?""Speaker 2: Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area.""Speaker 1: So you should bring an umbrella often.""Speaker 2: I'm not interested in it. Are you keen on it?""Speaker 1: Yes, That's funny. I thought you liked it.""Speaker 2: I hate it.""Speaker 1: Never mind. It'll be over in 10 minutes.""Speaker 2: Not really. What about you?""Speaker 1: We will have our midterm exams next month. I plan to look for some important books and study at the library. Do you want to join me?""Speaker 2: Sure. I need to return some books. They are due today. Besides, I can also read some weekly publications, Magazines and newspapers.""Speaker 1: Great. We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that.""Speaker 2: That sounds like a good idea. We can chill out a little in such a hot summer. Are you good at swimming?""Speaker 1: Well, That's a good question. I haven't swum for almost two years. I think I need more practice.""Speaker 2: Oh, It's almost 9. I need to hurry. I am running late now. See you after class in front of the library then. Bye!""Speaker 2: I don't think so. I know I've put on weight this winter.""Speaker 1: So you are watching your weight, Aren't you?""Speaker 2: No way!""Speaker 1: Sweet little lassie. Yep, Broke her heart when theD-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy.""Speaker 2: It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event. Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times. Oh. My goodness! I'm afraid the team is under a spell.""Speaker 1: Well, At least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield. They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria. And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense. I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later.""Speaker 2: I agree. Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders, They breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate, Well-timed passes.""Speaker 1: That's why I still have very high hopes for the team. Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage, The Germans will probably make it through to the finals.""Speaker 2: You're right, But you know, It's hard to give up an old habit.""Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.""Speaker 2: You know, I often have to work till late at night. I need something to keep me awake.""Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.""Speaker 2: Certainly not. What really counts is to play as a team, Passing the ball amongst each other, Dodging defenders. Free kicks are a result of all the teammates 'collective efforts. However, A few free k.""Speaker 1: In the case, Maybe facial charm should be his leading card. After all, The majority of his fans are girls.""Speaker 2: Yes, His face looks are manly, With a straight nose and infinite eyes. As a man of medium height in the West, He keeps a powerful but elegant figure, Looking neither lanky nor stout.""Speaker 2: Me either. From the very first page, This author just pulled me right in!""Speaker 1: Can I read it when you're finished?""Speaker 2: Yes. I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping.""Speaker 1: Don't tell me anything about it. I want to read it for myself.""Speaker 2: What was that like?""Speaker 1: It was always very busy there.""Speaker 2: What did you do?""Speaker 1: I stood behind the register and took pizza orders.""Speaker 2: Did you get any perks on the job?""Speaker 2: They don't now, But most of them did originally. There's picture of the pentagon in the united states. It's very distinctive with its five sides.""Speaker 1: Look at that cylindrical office building. I'Ve never been seen one that shape before.""Speaker 2: Yes. Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape.""Speaker 1: Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top. They're not perfectly cylindrical.""Speaker 2: This is the world's largest sports stadium. It's a massive oval.""Speaker 1: What sports do they play there?""Speaker 2: It says here that it'sm mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings.""Speaker 1: Is that building a perfect cube?""Speaker 2: According to the book, It is. I'Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube. Look at the building. From the air, It looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides. What.""Speaker 1: Thanks.""Speaker 2: I didn't know you smoked.""Speaker 1: Really? I've been smoking for over a year now.""Speaker 2: Oh. You're new to smoking still. I've been smoking for 7 years.""Speaker 1: You ever tried to quit?""Speaker 2: Many times. I'm really addicted. It's harder to stop than you think.""Speaker 1: Yeah. I tried to quit last month, And I thought it was going to be easy, But it turns out that I'm still smoking.""Speaker 2: I highly recommend you quit soon. The longer you smoke, The harder it becomes to quit.""Speaker 1: I think you're right. Aright. Gotta go to class. Thanks for the cigarette. I'll talk to you later.""Speaker 2: Good gracious! Are you sure?""Speaker 1: I am. Whatsmore, His wife is 84.""Speaker 2: Is she really?""Speaker 1: Yes, She is. And guess what, He is her sixth husband.""Speaker 2: Yes, It was a very evenly matched game.""Speaker 1: What were the results of the game?""Speaker 2: It ended in a tie.""Speaker 1: What was the actual score?""Speaker 2: It was three all.""Speaker 1: Really? I thought Barcelona was going to win. They are a much better team than Madrid.""Speaker 2: If Barcelona had played as they normally do, They should have won.""Speaker 1: What happened?""Speaker 2: Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal, But he kept on playing anyway.""Speaker 1: That explains it.""Speaker 2: How many more games are left this season?""Speaker 1: That was the last game before the playoffs.""Speaker 2: When do the playoffs start?""Speaker 1: In a few weeks. Are you planning on watching them?""Speaker 2: Of course! I really love watching football games on TV.""Speaker 1: Me, Too! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together.""Speaker 2: Sure, That would be great.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I've invited a lot of friends besides you.""Speaker 1: Should I take my shoes off?""Speaker 2: We all keep our shoes on indoors.""Speaker 1: Where are your parents?""Speaker 2: They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves.""Speaker 2: Oh! I'm sorry, But I wish you could stay.""Speaker 1: Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality.""Speaker 2: Well, You'd better get some more warm clothes.""Speaker 1: What's the temperature today anyway?""Speaker 2: Yes, We do. My parents prepare dinner for me.""Speaker 1: What would you do at the party?""Speaker 2: We sing \"Happy Birthday\" at the party and have birthday cakes.""Speaker 1: Do you know when people began to sing the song \"Happy Birthday\"?""Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.""Speaker 1: Let me tell you the story. In 1892, Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called \"Good Morning to you\". But later someone added the words \"Happy Birthday\" to their tune.""Speaker 2: So the \"Happy Birthday\" song has been popular since then?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: And a white sports car.""Speaker 2: Um, That's good.""Speaker 2: No trouble at all. He's very cute and brave. By the way, Do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks.""Speaker 2: Yes, That would be perfect.""Speaker 1: See you tonight then.""Speaker 2: Of course. Here you are.""Speaker 2: Oh! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs, Raising kids... At least you can eat the pigs. �.""Speaker 1: Ha-ha. I get it. That's funny.

You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup! It's really not healthy!""Speaker 1: Fine! I'll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat. Are you happy now?""Speaker 2: In the spring.""Speaker 1: Oh, Lovely.

Let's go.""Speaker 2: ( At the zoo ) Wow! This zoo is really huge.""Speaker 1: Yes, You can find hundreds of various animals here. It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan.""Speaker 2: Look at the map.

I think we are here to see the pandas.""Speaker 2: We have to go to the mammal area. We are at the gate right now. We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn.""Speaker 2: Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives. Government service can be a rewarding and secure career.""Speaker 1: Do you mean financially rewarding?""Speaker 2: Well, Many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries.""Speaker 1: I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy.""Speaker 2: Sometimes that's true, But not usually. Most feds are honest, Hard-working professionals. It's hard to keep highly trained people, So the pay and working conditions have to be attractive.""Speaker 1: How much do you make?""Speaker 2: I'm starving, Too. There is a new Chinese restaurant close by. Do you want to go there for lunch?""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: It's my treat this time.""Speaker 2: Really.""Speaker 1: And not expensive either.""Speaker 2: Oh, I don't care about that.""Speaker 1: Everybody is buying them.""Speaker 2: Are they?""Speaker 1: Yes, They're very fashionable, You see.""Speaker 2: I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion.""Speaker 1: I see.""Speaker 2: But thank you very much all the same.""Speaker 2: Me too. Seems like all I do is eat and sleep.""Speaker 1: Gotta go. Call me tonight.""Speaker 2: What should we do, Now with Jack out of the game?""Speaker 1: We should choose from the backups.""Speaker 2: That's right. Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match.""Speaker 1: That's why we should learn to protect ourselves. Otherwise, The game is not worth the candle.""Speaker 2: That's for sure. During the back court, We should change the position we played.""Speaker 1: Yes, I played shooting guard, I like shooting and you'll play inside, Ok?""Speaker 2: I agree with you. I think we'll play much better than before.""Speaker 1: Wow, The cheer-section is coming. The music is so fantastic.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Look how passionate they are!

I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you!""Speaker 1: Oh, You didn't have to...""Speaker 2: Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies.""Speaker 1: With Susan leaving, We should probably look to someone new on board.""Speaker 2: Our human resource department is working on it, It's not easy to recruit new employees every few month, It's hard to find qualified people.""Speaker 2: We parted from each other last month.""Speaker 1: Have you got a new one?""Speaker 2: Mmmm, No. How about you?""Speaker 1: I am single, I have no real of, Only an E-gf, That is you.""Speaker 2: Haha, So you are my E-bf.""Speaker 1: I like you.

I think that's important.""Speaker 2: It that why you wear second-hand cloths as well? Because they've got character?""Speaker 1: No, That's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time!""Speaker 2: I see. If you lived in an old house, Would it be decorated in a modern way?""Speaker 2: Well, Yes. I don't mind admitting that I am. I enjoyed school, But I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams.""Speaker 1: Well, What are you going to do now? Have you made any plans?""Speaker 2: Yes, I intend to go to university. That'll be in September. But it all depends on my A level results.""Speaker 1: You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects?""Speaker 2: I made strawberry shortcake.""Speaker 1: Ooh, That's my favorite. Maybe I'll have a small slice.""Speaker 2: Great.

Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies. Refugee camps have been set up across the region.""Speaker 1: How many countries have been affected?""Speaker 2: Six have been seriously affected, But the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries.""Speaker 1: I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran.""Speaker 2: Yes. There have been a few there recently. They say that this one was not a big quake. The Iranians are dealing with it on their own. They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble.""Speaker 1: Does the newspaper say anything about casualties?""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: Yes, It's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds.""Speaker 2: How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas?""Speaker 1: The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms. The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation.""Speaker 2: It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody!""Speaker 2: No, I haven't had a chance to. But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce.""Speaker 1: Oh, Really? I saw it two years ago. It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I found it is so close to our life.""Speaker 1: It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world.""Speaker 2: You said it. You know, The divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years.""Speaker 1: Well, It's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too.""Speaker 2: I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's too short-lived.""Speaker 2: That's true. It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation.""Speaker 1: I can't agree more. The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage.""Speaker 2: Definitely. They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously.""Speaker 1: In their mind, Love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone.""Speaker 2: You're making a federal case out of it. One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything. It could even make your life more interesting.""Speaker 1: Are you serious, John?""Speaker 2: I want to finish my degree in four years. So I don't want to forget to take classes I need. I have a friend who has to stay in college another year. She didn't know until recently. There were some classes she needed to take to graduate. She didn't know about them.""Speaker 1: Yes, That happens.""Speaker 2: I brought my transcript from my first year. Here. And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall.""Speaker 1: Alright. Good. I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements. You have one botany class and one chemistry class. And political science. So that's nine credits. Did you take English Composition 201?""Speaker 2: No, I don't need to. I took Advanced Placement English in high school. So I'm not required to take composition.""Speaker 1: Excellent. I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester. And the modern novel class. You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet.""Speaker 2: No, I thought I would take it later.""Speaker 1: Actually, I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later.""Speaker 2: Well, I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class. I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets.""Speaker 1: Let me look at the timetable. Shakespeare meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11.""Speaker 2: I can take it then. I have that time slot free.""Speaker 1: Good. I recommend it. Shakespeare is of course enormously important. We want our students to take the class as soon as they can. And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher.""Speaker 2: I'll take it then.""Speaker 1: Tell me, Lisa, What made you decide to be an English major?""Speaker 2: I want to be an English professor in the future. I love studying literature, And I want to teach it.""Speaker 1: Really? That's great to know.""Speaker 2: Yes, That was the first thing we did. We went all the way to the top. There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there.""Speaker 1: What else did you see?""Speaker 2: Art galleries, Cathedrals, Statues, Fountains, Palaces, Bistros, There's really too much to say.""Speaker 1: You must have had a great time.""Speaker 2: Yes, At the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun. However, On the third day of traveling in the city, I felt sick. I think I had something bad to eat, But it passed by the evening.""Speaker 1: Yes, You need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad. Sometimes new food might disagree with you.""Speaker 2: On the fouth day, We went to taste the French cuisine. That was really fantastic! And no stomach problems.""Speaker 1: That is great. Everyone says French food is wonderful.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry for that, I'm going to check with the chef right now. Miss, I just checked with the kitchen, And they said your order will be coming right up next. Oh, Here comes.""Speaker 1: Thank you.""Speaker 2: Miss, I'm very sorry for the delay, Please enjoy this. Free a glass of wine for inconvenience. Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long.""Speaker 2: My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer, And I suppose you dance often.""Speaker 1: Me? Oh, No. In fact, I took up dancing quite recently.""Speaker 2: Oh, Really? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well.""Speaker 1: I'm glad you say so, You dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments. It's just that you are a good leader. Do you like the fox-trot and tango?""Speaker 1: Yes. And what dances do you do best?""Speaker 2: Disco is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings, And is a healthy exercise. But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance.""Speaker 1: Oh, Well, The music has stopped. Thank you for the dance.""Speaker 2: My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.""Speaker 2: It is a very difficult climb, Because there are not many places to put your hands and feet.""Speaker 1: What did you do last week?""Speaker 2: We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff. It's very exciting.""Speaker 1: Wow. That sounds like a lot of fun. I am sorry I missed it.""Speaker 2: Well, You should come this weekend. I think you could do the climb.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I will. See you then!""Speaker 2: 15 people.""Speaker 1: Wow. That is a very big family. Do you all live together?""Speaker 2: Of course we do! My father's parents, Mum, Dad, Three unmarried aunts, Two uncles, My two brothers, My three sisters and me.""Speaker 1: But you don't live at home anymore.""Speaker 2: Right, But that's where my heart is. But you're right, Now there are only 14 living at home.""Speaker 1: My goodness! Your family must live in a huge house.""Speaker 2: Yes. My family lives in rural Korea, Near Pusan. We have a huge house. The first floor of the house is a part-time private school. In the afternoon, Students come for special tutoring in biology, Englis.""Speaker 1: Wow! You grew up in a school! No wonder your English is excellent!""Speaker 2: My aunts and uncles are all teachers.""Speaker 1: You are so lucky!""Speaker 2: I guess so. While growing up, I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year.""Speaker 1: That's what i did in America. I was reading all the time. I was never a big TV watcher. Tv wastes time.""Speaker 2: I agree. Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English. All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English.""Speaker 1: 800 books? I'm impressed!""Speaker 2: Well sir, Our sales have dropped, No plunged, Fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, Or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, It would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It's a real mess.""Speaker 1: For crying out loud... How fast are we losing money?""Speaker 2: Um... How can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, We will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months.""Speaker 1: What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news?""Speaker 2: Oh, That's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, Well, Half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're going to have to shoulder this cost.""Speaker 1: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess!""Speaker 2: We tried that, Sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.""Speaker 1: We're doomed!""Speaker 2: There is some really good news though!""Speaker 1: Really? What!""Speaker 2: It's challenging, I feel I have learned a lot.""Speaker 1: What's strength do you bring to the job?""Speaker 2: I get along well with people, And I enjoy working with others.""Speaker 2: Oh, Without a doubt. When is the next class?""Speaker 1: Tomorrow morning. Try it.""Speaker 2: No problem.""Speaker 1: Are you going to this class this morning?""Speaker 2: Of course, Easy. No sweat.""Speaker 1: You're no able to move after this class.""Speaker 2: Are you kidding me? It's going to be up a piece of cake.""Speaker 1: You want to bet?""Speaker 2: Yeah, What't the bet?""Speaker 2: Sure. Look here. Canada is north of the United States.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Where's Mexico?""Speaker 2: Mexico is south of the United States.""Speaker 1: How about Connecticut? Where's that?""Speaker 2: Connecticut is east of New York.""Speaker 1: What state is west of Pennsylvania?""Speaker 2: Ohio.""Speaker 1: Ok, Where's Los Angeles?""Speaker 2: Los Angeles is in California. It's southeast of San Francisco.""Speaker 1: Where's Boston.""Speaker 2: Boston is in the northeast part of the country.""Speaker 1: Where is Las Vegas?""Speaker 2: Which one do you like best?""Speaker 1: I prefer the novels by Hemingway, Such as The Old Man and the Sea. I like the simple words in his novels.""Speaker 2: Yup. Though the words he used are simple, But the spirit he has conveyed is great.""Speaker 2: That's Anna for you. She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman. Here she comes.""Speaker 1: She's glowing. It must be the pregnancy.""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow.""Speaker 1: How nice! I can see you are busying packing. I'm sorry to interrupt you.""Speaker 2: That's all right. I'm almost finished. Do you need my help?""Speaker 1: Yes, Could you please go over this for me? And see if there is any mistake in it?""Speaker 2: Oh. All right I'll read it soon.""Speaker 1: Excuse me for taking your time.""Speaker 2: Yes, I kept on typing it until midnight, But it is lost.""Speaker 1: Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk?""Speaker 2: Yes, But there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk.""Speaker 1: How about the shelf?""Speaker 2: I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it?""Speaker 1: Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go.""Speaker 2: I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing?""Speaker 1: Cheer up! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week. There is no need to write a new one. Oh, What's this? Is this your dissertation?""Speaker 2: Let me see. Yes, That's it. Where did you find it?""Speaker 1: You'Ve put it among these journals.""Speaker 2: Oh, That's right. Well, The train shouldn't be late. That means there is only one explanation... Bill must have overslept.""Speaker 1: Well, To be fare, Since he's coming all the way from Lancaster, He's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us. He must get start on his commute about six thirty, No telling what time he actually gets up.""Speaker 2: That's right, Because he's got to get to the train station from his house, Then take the blue line into the city, Then switch trains to the red line. In all, The trip's got to take more than 2 hours.""Speaker 1: Why doesn't he just drive to work?""Speaker 2: Take the magazines out of the bookcase. Put them in that box.""Speaker 1: All right.""Speaker 2: Peter! Pack them. Don't read them.""Speaker 1: These magazines are interesting. May I borrow one?""Speaker 2: Of course.""Speaker 2: Many customers didn't want them.""Speaker 1: How about giving them to that old man?""Speaker 2: Good idea.""Speaker 1: By the way, Do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers?""Speaker 2: I'm not sure, But still it did attract a large crowds today.""Speaker 1: I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper.""Speaker 2: But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around.""Speaker 1: That's true.""Speaker 2: Anyway, Let's just finish out job and get back home.""Speaker 2: Hah hah! You have to go before me.""Speaker 1: You think it's funny. I'm terrified.""Speaker 2: Don't worry. It's safe.""Speaker 1: But I've never jumped off anything in my life. The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed. I'm scared.""Speaker 2: You are the one who wanted to come here, Sandy. You should enjoy it.""Speaker 1: I guess I'm adventuresome, But then I'm scared too.""Speaker 2: I don't know. Maybe they're really crazy.""Speaker 2: Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball.""Speaker 2: Of course, My father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child.""Speaker 1: But my father did not. He didn't have much time.""Speaker 2: Honey, I'm sorry. I promise you, This summer vacation, I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains. It is more beautiful and magnificent.""Speaker 1: Really? It's a deal. Have you ever been there?""Speaker 2: Yes, I went there five years ago. You were still a baby at that time.""Speaker 1: It really gets me interested. Is it higher than Kiang Shan?""Speaker 2: Surely. You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls. The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty.""Speaker 1: Can I see the rainbow?""Speaker 2: Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal?""Speaker 1: Yes, We'll start with appetizers, Follow with a soup and salad course, Then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken, And finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort.""Speaker 2: That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal, Don't you think?""Speaker 1: As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic, We should be okay.""Speaker 2: With your prime rib and chicken choices, You'd better hope nobody's vegetarian.""Speaker 2: Ok. Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington. Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit.""Speaker 1: Got that.""Speaker 2: Ok - when you leave the Underground, Cross the road and you should see Horntown Street. Was up that street to the crossroads. As you was you should see a fast food place on your right.""Speaker 1: Hold on, I am looking at the map now. Ok, I can see Horntown Road. Do I go straight at the intersection?""Speaker 2: No, You need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right.""Speaker 1: Ok, I can see that road.""Speaker 2: That's fine. You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library.""Speaker 1: Good, I can see the library on the map.""Speaker 2: Ok, We live in the third building on your left. Will we see you around 7 pm?""Speaker 2: Wow! Congratulation! When do classes start?""Speaker 1: Freshman orientation is the last week of august, But I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in.""Speaker 2: You're so lucky! Do you have to do many things before you leave?""Speaker 1: Yes. I'll be very busy! I have to get a visa, Buy a plane ticket, And pack my things. But first, I want to register for classes.""Speaker 2: When can you do that?""Speaker 1: Well, They sent me their prospectus, So I can start looking now. Do you want to help me decide which classed to take?""Speaker 2: Sure. What can you choose from?""Speaker 1: Well, I have to take all the fundamental course, Plus a few from my major.""Speaker 2: What is your major?""Speaker 1: I hope to major in English literature, But the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year, So we'll see.""Speaker 2: What are the fundamental course?""Speaker 1: In order to graduate, Every student must take a certain amount of classes in history, Math, English, Philosophy, Science and art.""Speaker 2: Interesting. That's very different from the Chinese education system.""Speaker 1: Yes, It is. It's also very different from the British education system.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: Oh, Sure. In British, Students don't have to take the foundation course.""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 2: I'm a defender. It's a lot of fun. You don't have to be able to skate as fast on defense.""Speaker 1: Yeah, You're a pretty big guy. I play goalie, Myself.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah? Which team?""Speaker 1: The Rockets.""Speaker 2: Really? I think we play you guys next week. Well, I have to go to practice. See you later.""Speaker 2: It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.""Speaker 1: And how long does the course last?""Speaker 2: It lasts for 9 months.""Speaker 1: When does it start?""Speaker 2: The next beginning class starts on October 25th.""Speaker 1: What time is the class?""Speaker 2: From 7 to 9 o'clock.""Speaker 1: How much does it cost?""Speaker 2: It costs 125 dollars a month.""Speaker 1: Yes, That's all right. I want to enroll in the course.""Speaker 2: Thank you, Please fill out this form for us.""Speaker 1: Do you want me to fill it out now?""Speaker 2: Sure, Come on in.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much. Are you here alone?""Speaker 2: My father and sister are out to photographing. What about you?""Speaker 1: I'm a back-packer from America.""Speaker 2: What is a back-packer?""Speaker 1: It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world.""Speaker 2: Cool. You must have been to a lot of places.""Speaker 1: Yes, Actually almost half of all the countries over the world. I love traveling places.""Speaker 2: So cool. I want to be a back-packer when I grow up.""Speaker 1: You can do it. But do work hard on your English to make it easier.""Speaker 2: It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee. Es-PRESS-o, Get it?""Speaker 2: Pleased to meet you. My name is Alice. Did you just move in next door?""Speaker 1: Yes, I did. Have you lived here long?""Speaker 2: Me? I guess so. I've lived here for about six years now. Have you lived in America very long?""Speaker 1: No, Not really. When I left Vietnam, I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years. Where do you work, Alice?""Speaker 2: I teach mathematics at a college. What do you do?""Speaker 1: I am an accountant at a company.""Speaker 2: Well, Tom. It's good to meet you. I have to go now. I am teaching a class this evening, And I need to get to the college.""Speaker 1: It's nice meeting you too, Alice.""Speaker 2: See you around!""Speaker 2: Good. See you!""Speaker 2: Really it depends on my mood. When I am sad or depressed, I like comedies. If I'm feeling good, I'll watch almost anything.""Speaker 1: I see. I generally like movies to help calm me down. I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Unfortunately, Nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film.""Speaker 1: True. The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial. You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value. I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today. You can name a lot of classics from that decade.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties. They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time.""Speaker 2: But I still get stuck on the different tones. It drives me crazy.""Speaker 2: That sounds boring to me.""Speaker 1: What do you plan on doing after you retire?""Speaker 2: Yes, I think I will do something new. I'Ve always wanted to be a teacher. I'm willing to begin studying to teach.""Speaker 2: No, Not at all. Very straight. Her hair comes down like this... Just over the ears.""Speaker 1: Does she wear glasses?""Speaker 2: No... No. I think you're thinking of someone else.""Speaker 1: No. I'm sure I know her.""Speaker 2: Er... What else can I tell you? Er... She's got... Er a... Round face, A very round face, And a very big mouth, Sort of wide mouth, When she laughs, Her face is all mouth.""Speaker 2: I have two kids. A boy and a girl.""Speaker 1: What are their names?""Speaker 2: Jack and Stephanie.""Speaker 1: How old are they?""Speaker 2: Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24.""Speaker 1: Are they in school?""Speaker 2: Stephanie is. She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida.""Speaker 1: What does Stephanie study?""Speaker 2: She studies English.""Speaker 1: Is she here now?""Speaker 2: These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, All right?""Speaker 1: That would be great!""Speaker 2: Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading?""Speaker 1: This one right here should be right.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that, Right?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Let's do the math.""Speaker 2: I count all of the correct answers, Total them, And divide by the total. Does this look right to you?""Speaker 1: Looks pretty good.""Speaker 2: No... He told me I'm pregnant!""Speaker 1: Congratulations!""Speaker 2: And so I bought all these books on having kids and...""Speaker 1: And they said you should play classical music?""Speaker 2: That's easy. Everyone knows that there are nine.""Speaker 1: Not anymore! Can you believe it? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore!""Speaker 2: Nice try. I wasn't born yesterday, You know.""Speaker 1: I'm dead serious. They've decided that it's too small to be a planet, But actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore.""Speaker 2: That sounds crazy. But they can't just change their mind about things like that.""Speaker 1: Yes, They can. If you remember correctly, People used to believe that the world was flat.""Speaker 2: I suppose you're right. They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them, Not the other way around.""Speaker 1: We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos.""Speaker 2: Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation?""Speaker 1: I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way.""Speaker 2: Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space?""Speaker 1: I hope not. I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth.""Speaker 2: You're so old-fashioned. That's what people used to think about people from another country!""Speaker 2: Well, Yes. I don't mind admitting that I am. I enjoyed school, But I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams.""Speaker 1: Well, What are you going to do now? Have you made any plans?""Speaker 2: Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday?""Speaker 1: Tomorrow? No, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to. I'm going out of the town on business.""Speaker 2: What about Saturday?""Speaker 1: Sorry, I never go out on Saturday evening. I always watch football on Saturday evening.""Speaker 2: Will you come round next Tuesday?""Speaker 1: Next Tuesday? Just a moment! It will be the 21st of May. Oh, Dear. Arm... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party.""Speaker 2: Ok. Wait a minute.""Speaker 1: Look at the snow, It's so beautiful.""Speaker 2: Yes. It's really snowing.""Speaker 1: I love winter, I love snow.""Speaker 2: But don't you think it's a little too cold?""Speaker 1: But I like cold more than hot.""Speaker 2: I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week.""Speaker 1: Do you ever speak to native speakers of English?""Speaker 2: It was actually a long two months. She was a psycho.""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: She would be laughing one moment, And if I said something insensitive, She would start crying. I didn't want to deal with that.""Speaker 1: She sounds very emotional.""Speaker 2: She was a psycho, Man. One time we were suppose to get together. I was waiting for her call, And when she finally called, She was screaming why I wasn't at her place.""Speaker 1: Were you suppose to be there?""Speaker 2: Why ere you getting off work so late? The office close at six, Doesn't it?""Speaker 1: Yes. But those are the rush in that moment. And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters.""Speaker 2: Didn't you tell him you have an appointment?""Speaker 1: Well, No. I thought I ‘Ve finish in five minutes. And I didn't want to be difficult about just few minutes, If I hadn't been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry.""Speaker 2: I found it very disappointing.""Speaker 1: She liked the acting, Too, Because that's what she wanted to see.""Speaker 2: I wasn't happy with it.""Speaker 2: You're too strict with yourself.""Speaker 2: It's the end of the world for me.""Speaker 1: What makes you say that?""Speaker 2: Today, I'm told I failed three courses.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Work harder next term.""Speaker 2: B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me.""Speaker 1: Don't lose heart. Everything will be fine.""Speaker 2: Sure I am. I work for myself, But I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area.""Speaker 1: A virtual office?""Speaker 2: Yeah, An office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies. I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building.""Speaker 1: What kind of services do they offer?""Speaker 2: My sister did it. When did you get yours cut?""Speaker 1: Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.""Speaker 2: Well, It looks very nice.""Speaker 2: I doubt it, I'll deal with it right away. Luckily it wasn't a glass of red wine, I'll just get a bowl of water and a cloth.""Speaker 1: I'm going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag.""Speaker 2: Afterwards, We can do the washing up together. Everything will be finished within an hour. Your friend Keith is really funny. I liked his magic tricks.""Speaker 2: I've been going to the gym these days. The exercise makes me hungry all the time.""Speaker 1: So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out.""Speaker 2: Don't pull my leg.""Speaker 1: This way you'll probably put on more weight. Will you give up?""Speaker 2: Surely not. I can feel the results. I'm starting to feel different now.""Speaker 1: Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight?""Speaker 2: What a beautiful ship! Who's this?""Speaker 1: That's the man I told you about. Remember?""Speaker 2: Ah yes. The one who offered you a job in Australia.""Speaker 1: That's right.""Speaker 2: Who's this?""Speaker 1: Guess!""Speaker 2: It's not you, Is it?""Speaker 1: That's right. I grew a beard during the trip, But I shaved it off when I came home.""Speaker 2: Just asking?! Why is your face burning like mad? Ah-huh, Someone has a crush on Jenny, Doesn't he?""Speaker 1: Who has a crush?""Speaker 2: Come on, Ted! Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You'Ve got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.""Speaker 1: Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out.""Speaker 2: What are you so afraid of? Just tell her what you are feeling about her.""Speaker 1: I'd totally die if she turned me down.""Speaker 2: What happened?""Speaker 2: Well, I am. I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting. Is Tom coming to pick you up?""Speaker 1: No. We'll meet at my house. He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa.""Speaker 2: That's nice. Where is his villa?""Speaker 1: It's not his villa, But his father's. I think it's somewhere in Florida. I am not sure myself.""Speaker 2: Sometimes I envy you a lot. Tom is a good guy.""Speaker 2: Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays.""Speaker 1: So there are only five working days in a week?""Speaker 2: Right. What are you going to do tonight?""Speaker 1: I'm going to study.""Speaker 2: On a Friday night?""Speaker 2: How tall is she?""Speaker 1: She's fairly tall, Maybe 2 inches taller than me.""Speaker 2: Is she chubby?""Speaker 1: Not at all. She's actually very athletic.""Speaker 2: It sounds like she's pretty good-looking. Does she wear glasses?""Speaker 1: No, But she does wear contact lenses.""Speaker 2: How's her skin?""Speaker 2: Yep. Let's do it. I'm pretty excited!""Speaker 1: I know a place that should be perfect. It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety. You can even buy a live chicken there if you want.""Speaker 2: Live chicken? Thanks, But no thanks. So... Tell me about bargaining. How can I do it like a local?""Speaker 2: Thank you for such a lovely evening! The food was amazing, And I had a great time.""Speaker 1: Me too. You look so beautiful tonight! I wish this night would never end. There's something I have to tell you...""Speaker 2: What is it?""Speaker 2: Jennifer, There's something I wanna ask you.""Speaker 1: Sure. What is it?""Speaker 2: Hmm... Okay, Here's the thing. I'Ve always seen you as more than just a friend, And I can't take it any more. I know you better than anyone, I know the pros and cons of your personality, I even know what side of the bed is yours! I think we would be great together, Don't you?""Speaker 1: Are you serious? We'Ve been friends for years! We can't just change that overnight!""Speaker 2: I usually have cereal, But sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast.""Speaker 1: That sounds nice. How do you spend your mornings?""Speaker 2: I usually do housework in mornings. I go shopping occasionally. I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket. I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center. It takes about 20 minutes to drive there.""Speaker 1: How do you spend your afternoons?""Speaker 2: Oh, The car is old but still in good condition. I just think we should be thrifty, Whether you are rich or not.""Speaker 1: But... But...""Speaker 2: Sit down. I'll show you the list of our financial budget. First of all, It is nearly 4, 000 RIB that we should spend in transportation.""Speaker 1: Ah, The transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget.""Speaker 2: Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel. But if we want to save money, We can choose a hotel which is not so good.""Speaker 1: Hmm, What I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel.""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: I mean Internet brings benefit a lot, But also some disadvantages. For example, Many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online, Etc.""Speaker 2: I agree. But I think although it has some negative effects, On the whole Internet does more good to us than harm.""Speaker 2: She is expecting.""Speaker 1: Congratulations to you.""Speaker 2: I come from China. Are you American?""Speaker 1: Yeah, That's right. So what are you studying?""Speaker 2: Business management.""Speaker 2: I really don't know.""Speaker 1: You can't think of anything?""Speaker 2: I really like where I'm at now.""Speaker 1: So, Why don't you just stay here?""Speaker 2: That may be what I'm going to do.""Speaker 1: It's a perfectly good school.""Speaker 2: You're absolutely right.""Speaker 1: Do you know what you're going to do now?""Speaker 2: I don't mind paying high rent to live in New York.""Speaker 1: Why? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live.""Speaker 1: Just alright?!? She's hot!""Speaker 2: Why don't you go talk to her?""Speaker 1: You think she's out of my league?""Speaker 2: Hell no! You're just a chicken that's all.""Speaker 1: C'mon. I get nervous when I talk to girls.""Speaker 2: Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up, Strike a conversation.""Speaker 1: What do I talk about?""Speaker 2: It doesn't matter. You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that.""Speaker 2: Either way. I don't care.""Speaker 1: How about a snack after work?""Speaker 2: I couldn't careless.""Speaker 1: Would you rather stay home?""Speaker 2: Whatever you say.""Speaker 1: Are you really interested in doing something?""Speaker 2: Typical Francis, Whether you are at work, Or engaged in leisure time activities, You always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself.""Speaker 2: Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives. Government service can be a rewarding and secure career.""Speaker 1: Do you mean financially rewarding?""Speaker 2: Well, Many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries.""Speaker 1: I'Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy.""Speaker 2: He is tall and slim, Fair-haired.""Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?""Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate. I am impressed with how smart and humorous.""Speaker 2: Right!""Speaker 1: And that's it. You're done.""Speaker 2: Well, I am sorry you have to leave so early.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much. We really had a good time.""Speaker 2: Well. Thank you for coming.""Speaker 1: So see you.""Speaker 2: She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship.""Speaker 1: Really? That's the icing on the cake. Congratulation again!""Speaker 2: Are they having a sale?""Speaker 1: Yeah. Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale. It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on.""Speaker 2: That sounds great. Where should we meet?""Speaker 1: I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes.""Speaker 2: Sounds good. See you there.""Speaker 1: What do you think about these shoes?""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: Well, I hate the noise in the city, But I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The tow just don't go together.""Speaker 2: I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, But I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities.""Speaker 2: What's wrong?""Speaker 1: Well, My boyfriend was supposed to call me last night, But he never did.""Speaker 2: That's too bad. I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it. Don't be too upset about it.""Speaker 1: The thing is, This isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't.""Speaker 2: I see how that can get a bit annoying.""Speaker 1: A bit? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would! He's such a liar.""Speaker 2: What's wrong with you, Ted?""Speaker 1: I'm speaking French. Don't you know anything?""Speaker 2: What's wrong with speaking English?""Speaker 1: Well, I just got back from my language school. We have to speak French all day there. No English allowed!""Speaker 2: What are you doing that for?""Speaker 1: I'm trying to learn new skills. It makes me more qualified for a good job.""Speaker 2: You got that right... And my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes.""Speaker 1: You have all the fun, Don't you?""Speaker 2: Listen, I'd better get back to the grindstone.""Speaker 2: Some poisonous gas.""Speaker 1: I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty.""Speaker 2: Yes. I think I won't come here again next time.""Speaker 1: So do I.""Speaker 2: We waste a vacation.""Speaker 2: Then, What shall we do on Sunday.""Speaker 1: Let me see. We can visit the country. We haven't done that for such a long time.""Speaker 2: Good idea. I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby. We'll go to the zoo and the park another time. After all, We can put that off.""Speaker 2: So tell me about it!""Speaker 1: There are a lot of wild animals in that place, And also some special rules while visiting.""Speaker 2: Special rules?""Speaker 1: There, You only have two ways for visiting.""Speaker 2: Details?""Speaker 1: On their bus or in your own cars, And you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region.""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 2: Oh, Moblogging is a combination of the word 'mobile' and 'blogging'. It's another form of blogging. Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices.""Speaker 1: Sounds interesting! That must be very convenient.""Speaker 2: Yes, You're right. I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move. It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me.""Speaker 1: How can you do that?""Speaker 2: About 18 years, I started learning when I was a kid.""Speaker 1: That's really interesting. You have to play for me some time.""Speaker 2: Sure, So, What about you? Do you have any hobbies?""Speaker 2: Yes, Florida had great weather while we were there. You look tan, Too. Did you go somewhere?""Speaker 1: My friends and I just got back from Bali.""Speaker 2: Wow! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world, Don't they?""Speaker 1: Yes, We were lucky. My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands, So we were able to stay for free.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job.""Speaker 1: I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die.""Speaker 2: I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension.""Speaker 1: That's one of the conditions of my policy too. It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire.""Speaker 2: If I had chance again, I'd major in English. You're good at language.""Speaker 1: That's what my parents want me to do.""Speaker 2: You should take their advice. They know what's best for you.""Speaker 1: But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun, While I spend all my time doing reading and writing.""Speaker 2: But if you go to university, You'll still have time for fun.""Speaker 1: Hm, What you say makes sense. But you know, I still have to ask my parents for pocket money, And I hate to do so at this age.""Speaker 2: Yes, It is. Look at the little light! It blinks off and on.""Speaker 1: Jen, It's not alive... But it does look user-friendly.""Speaker 2: I don't think I'Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic. He doesn't seem to like anything. Which kinds of paintings do you prefer?""Speaker 1: I like landscapes and still life. You prefer abstract paintings, Don't you?""Speaker 2: Yes, Look at the photos I took.""Speaker 1: They are beautiful. You did a good job.""Speaker 2: Thank you for saying so.""Speaker 2: I'm serious, Zina. Back off. I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket.""Speaker 1: That won't be necessary, Elvin. Look, I want to apologize for your nose. I'm sorry.""Speaker 2: Thank you. Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow. I'll have the pictures ready by then.""Speaker 2: No, But my husband smokes twenty or more a day.""Speaker 1: When did you begin to smoke?""Speaker 2: I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen.""Speaker 1: Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?""Speaker 2: I wanted to, But I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.""Speaker 1: Right on, Right on! Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite! He was low on bread, But Sherry paid for everything.""Speaker 2: Gravy! Jim is such a jive turkey man. He is always hitting me up for cash. Anyway, You wanna book and go grab some grub?""Speaker 2: Thanks, But I speak English with a strong German accent.""Speaker 1: But let me tell you, You're doing just fine. I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German. By the way, How long have you been learning English?""Speaker 2: And I got it on sale.""Speaker 2: Hmm. Sounds like she has pretty pricey tastes.""Speaker 1: Well, I really like being with her.""Speaker 2: Have you thought about going Dutch?""Speaker 1: Dutch, Where's that?""Speaker 2: Not where, What. Dutch means you both pay your own way.""Speaker 2: How old is she?""Speaker 1: Um... Let me see now, Is it 18 or 19, I can never remember... 18... 19 next birthday.Tthat's it.""Speaker 2: What does she look like?""Speaker 1: Well...""Speaker 2: Pretty, Is she?""Speaker 2: Yes, Do you always gather to welcome new comers?""Speaker 1: Never.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 2: Well. I'm rather disappointed with it.""Speaker 1: How come?""Speaker 2: It's too old. And it isn't as specious as I expected.""Speaker 1: Oh. It's awful, But it can't be helped.""Speaker 2: I don't understand of myself. It seems they have to save money.""Speaker 2: That's a big mistake, You should always have a good breakfast. You will not run your car without fuel, And yet you won't expect your body to work without food.""Speaker 1: I never thought about it that way.""Speaker 2: I bet you eat a large evening meal, Then sit and watch TV or read a book. Then instead of burning off your energy, Your body stores it as fat.""Speaker 1: Oh doctor, I feel so foolish.""Speaker 2: Yeah, You are right.""Speaker 1: We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years, But cars are still a major source of them. Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced.""Speaker 2: The problem is now on a truly global scale. I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it.""Speaker 2: Yes, Besides it versa according to the distance.""Speaker 1: All right. I only hope to get a skillful driver, And drive me to my stop safe way.""Speaker 2: No problem.""Speaker 1: Thanks a lot, Bye bye.""Speaker 2: No, Not yet.""Speaker 1: Who composed it for your?""Speaker 2: You needn't ask anyone. You can get on line to search for one.""Speaker 1: Can I get on line to search one, Too?""Speaker 2: Yeah. Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON.""Speaker 1: What about my SIEMENS?""Speaker 2: Have you ever talked to them about it?""Speaker 1: I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in, But they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again!""Speaker 2: What did they say?""Speaker 1: They both just talk about how great they are all the time.""Speaker 2: Congratulations! That's wonderful. I bet both of you are quite happy.""Speaker 1: Well, We have always dreamed of owning our own home, But real estate in this area is extremely expensive.""Speaker 2: I understand. That's why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town, Far from the city.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea if you can find employment nearby.""Speaker 2: You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none '. I don't feel like I really know any of my friends. In fact, I should probably call them acquaintances, Not friends.""Speaker 1: What about me? I'm your friend.""Speaker 2: I know you are, You are my girlfriend. I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes.""Speaker 1: I know what you mean. I find it difficult to make new friends, Too. It's not as easy as it was when we were young, Is it?""Speaker 2: Um... I have to confess, I haven't given it much thought. I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there.""Speaker 1: Really! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival?""Speaker 2: Oh... Sure. We have an entire month! In traditional Chinese culture, Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit.""Speaker 1: Cool! A whole month! What do you do during that month?""Speaker 2: Peter Madsen. A great A if I do say so myself.""Speaker 1: Nice pun. What is it you active about him most?""Speaker 2: He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom.""Speaker 1: He looks like a very personable man.""Speaker 2: Well, To begin with, Gambling is addictive, Ruins marriages, Destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, Cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, It exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, And senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.""Speaker 1: Geez! Now that I think about it, Maybe legalizing gambling isn't such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, And I didn't become addicted or anything like that.""Speaker 2: Mr. : Would you like to go to the nurse's?""Speaker 1: Yes, I would.""Speaker 2: Mr. : Here's a hall pass for it. Do you need someone to walk you there?""Speaker 1: I can manage on my own. Thanks.""Speaker 2: Great, Here are some flowers for you. I hope you like them. I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment.""Speaker 1: Thank you, They're beautiful. You can hang your coat over there. Try this new couch, It is so comfortable. You will love it. Want something to drink, Tea, Coffee, Juice or Cola?""Speaker 2: Don't bother. I will help myself.""Speaker 2: I will help to prepare food, Feed animals and clean up. I'm very excited about it now.""Speaker 1: It must be a unique experience. I'm looking forward to share your story when you come back.""Speaker 2: That's an understatement. I'm on cloud nine. I couldn't be any happier.""Speaker 1: Did you tell your parents yet?""Speaker 2: Not yet. I didn't get a hold of them. I'll try to call them again tonight.""Speaker 1: They're probably going to be so happy.""Speaker 2: In that case, You can park either in a student lot or on the street. Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots?""Speaker 1: No, I haven't seen those spots.""Speaker 2: The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit. Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night?""Speaker 1: I park in the daytime.""Speaker 2: Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits. Have you noticed those signs?""Speaker 1: No, I have not seen the signs.""Speaker 2: For instance, The mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study.""Speaker 1: That's true. Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones.""Speaker 2: Do you prefer brandy or ports.""Speaker 1: Port, Please.""Speaker 2: Excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor.""Speaker 1: The port is quite exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right?""Speaker 2: Yes. You always have a good nose for wines.""Speaker 1: Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.""Speaker 2: Withiced water, Please.""Speaker 1: Here you are, Sir. Bourbon withiced water.""Speaker 2: Thank you. Now how much do I owe you?""Speaker 1: The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge. So the total is 16. 5 dollars.""Speaker 2: That is OK. Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change.""Speaker 2: Whatever am i going to tell me parents.""Speaker 1: Don't worry about that, I am sure they will understand. After all, It was a very difficult exam.""Speaker 2: What am I to do?""Speaker 2: You didn't watch the end of the auction?""Speaker 1: I wouldn't say that's totally true. I've met many happy intercultural couples.""Speaker 2: Well, Then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner?""Speaker 1: I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men.""Speaker 2: So they're easy to remember.""Speaker 1: Yeah, How about your maths teacher?""Speaker 2: He's an old antique, Very serious.""Speaker 1: Bad luck, Anne.""Speaker 2: Hey! How about your history teacher?""Speaker 1: She's another antique.""Speaker 2: That's Cathy. She is pretty, Isn't she? She likes dancing. Ask her to dance.""Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.""Speaker 2: Don't be afraid. She isn't going to bite you.""Speaker 2: Of course. Here you are.""Speaker 2: Well, I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later...""Speaker 1: Look, It's starting!""Speaker 2: Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable.""Speaker 1: It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture. What do you think about this?""Speaker 2: I fancy going to Tibet for a few days. Have you ever been there?""Speaker 1: I went a long time ago, Before they built the new train that can take you there.""Speaker 2: Would you recommend going there for a few days?""Speaker 1: Personally, I think it'd be better to go when you have more time. A few days isn't really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital.""Speaker 2: You're probably right. What do you think about Yangshao?""Speaker 2: Not for a couple of years. What happened to her?""Speaker 1: Nothing exactly. She's grown into a very attractive young lady.""Speaker 2: Oh, She is.""Speaker 1: You know, Her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others.""Speaker 2: Not surprising. I bet she's very tall and slim.""Speaker 2: Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for.""Speaker 1: Why don't you like horror? They're entertaining.""Speaker 2: Some are entertaining, But I find most of them stupid and childish. For example, I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious.""Speaker 2: Oh, She likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class. She doesn't mind your making mistakes, Though.""Speaker 2: But I still get stuck on the different tones. It drives me crazy.""Speaker 2: Don't be so nervous! Relax! First, Sleep early at night. Second, Study two hours a day after school. Third, Don't tire yourself out, But don't be lazy. Will that help?""Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I am on the diet.""Speaker 1: That sounds ridiculous. Why?""Speaker 2: No way. I'd rather go to another movie house.""Speaker 1: Come on. We are already here. Besides, I really wanna see this picture.""Speaker 2: All right. Let's see when the next movie is playing?""Speaker 1: Seven thirty. There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line!""Speaker 2: Shall we take a chance?""Speaker 2: Surely it was, Especially when you only knew few people and little English.""Speaker 1: You mean you didn't know much English then?""Speaker 2: Right. I only knew a few English sentences.""Speaker 1: That's incredible. Could you tell me what you did to make a start?""Speaker 2: First, I worked as a servant.""Speaker 2: Good question. I have to think about it.""Speaker 1: My husband is betting on France.""Speaker 2: France? Is he crazy?""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: I don't mind. By contrast, I quite like the circumstances, As I can see a variety of people here, Who can always give me tremendous inspiration. And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life.""Speaker 1: I can see that. Then what is your favorite coffee?""Speaker 2: Irish coffee is my favorite. But I can drink any other. I'm not particular on it.""Speaker 2: One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: The survey said that the low, Income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis.""Speaker 1: That makes sense. Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper.""Speaker 2: And junk food contains lots of fat and oil. There is one final reason why so many people are fat.""Speaker 2: It's very thoughtful of you. Wow, It is so beautiful. Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas?""Speaker 2: I think you just need to get more sleep.""Speaker 2: Really? I'm very surprised. He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever do that sort of thing, Right?""Speaker 1: No, He doesn't. Anyway, She found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time.""Speaker 2: Maybe it is for the best. They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people.""Speaker 2: She wished good luck to you.""Speaker 1: The Dai people are enthusiastic.""Speaker 2: Actually, My office is right around the corner.""Speaker 1: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Yeah, It was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, But here's my card. We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.""Speaker 1: Sure, You still have my contact details, Right?""Speaker 2: You know what, This is really embarrassing, But your name has just slipped my mind. Can you remind me?""Speaker 2: Maurice Richard has the puck now, And passes it to the center. He shoots! Wow what a save by the goalie!""Speaker 2: That's what I thought. It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months.""Speaker 1: Two months? How did you find out?""Speaker 2: I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, And I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately.""Speaker 1: So you asked him about the girl who called?""Speaker 2: Roger Vargas is up at bat. The pitcher winds up and strike one!""Speaker 1: A very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher gives him the sign, He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive!""Speaker 2: Thanks for understanding.""Speaker 1: Well that's what being friends is about, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: Hey, What if the three of us go to the beach together? Besides, You and Bob haven't seen each other for a while. I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers.""Speaker 1: Nah, I wouldn't worry about that. But I don't want to be the third wheel. You two should have some quiet time to yourselves.""Speaker 2: You'll recover after a good night's sleep.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence.""Speaker 2: That's all right. Would you have a cup of coffee?""Speaker 1: Yes, Please. It's very kind of you.""Speaker 2: Don't mention it.""Speaker 1: The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well. You are very helpful. I want to thank you for everything you've done for me.""Speaker 2: It's my pleasure.""Speaker 2: Really? I'm very surprised. He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever do that sort of thing, Right?""Speaker 1: No, He doesn't. Anyway, She found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time.""Speaker 2: Maybe it is for the best. They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people.""Speaker 2: About 18 years, I started learning when I was a kid.""Speaker 1: That's really interesting, You have to play for me some time.""Speaker 2: Sure, So, What about you? Do you have any hobbies?""Speaker 2: Yeah, You're right.""Speaker 1: And have you taken anything for it?""Speaker 2: No, I haven't.""Speaker 1: Well, It's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock. Then drink a cup every half hour. It really works!""Speaker 2: She's demanding. But I like that. I mean, I know our timeline is tight.""Speaker 1: Tell me about it.""Speaker 2: You guys are working around the clock, I know. That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves.""Speaker 2: I don't know. I never went to one.""Speaker 1: Never? Really? I'm surprised.""Speaker 2: Many Americans have never gone to a ETV. It's not an American thing to do.""Speaker 1: But there are a lot of Kts in this town. There's one just two blocks from here.""Speaker 2: Good gracious. That's incredible!""Speaker 1: She married Jerrod.""Speaker 2: You're kidding.""Speaker 1: She's going to live in Paris.""Speaker 2: Public schools are usually state funded, Whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere.""Speaker 1: Which is better?""Speaker 2: One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers.""Speaker 1: I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools.""Speaker 2: Don't worry. You can't lose all your money. Because you won't gamble all your money.""Speaker 1: I guess you're right.""Speaker 2: Of course I'm right. I already told you the rule for Las Vegas. Remember?""Speaker 1: Yes, I remember. You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play.""Speaker 2: That's right. That's the best way to have control over yourself. You say to yourself. Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars. Only fifty dollars. No more. If you follow the rule, You can't lose more than fifty dollars.""Speaker 2: I don't like your Rose. And I do love Henry. And I'm going to marry him.""Speaker 1: But my Rose is great.""Speaker 2: Your Rose is a fool.""Speaker 1: Really, Mary, You're horrible.""Speaker 2: What are we doing?""Speaker 1: Mr. : I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves. Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage.""Speaker 2: May I have a book?""Speaker 2: I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening. Will you come with me? I've two complimentary tickets.""Speaker 1: With the greatest pleasure. Where is the concert this evening?""Speaker 2: It will be held at the Music Hall.""Speaker 1: What's on the program?""Speaker 2: Well, Honestly speaking, I went to watch it out of curiosity. I'd say it's really a special art form.""Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more. Actually, I'm a Beijing Opera fan.""Speaker 2: Well, There are only two classes open.""Speaker 1: Can you tell me what days the classes are on?""Speaker 2: One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p.M. To 4.""Speaker 1: And the other class?""Speaker 2: That class is from ten to twelve on Monday and Wednesday.""Speaker 1: Are you sure these are the only open classes?""Speaker 2: Yes, I am sure.""Speaker 1: Okay, Sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday.""Speaker 2: America? Did you get admit to MIT?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: Congratulations! Susan. I'm so happy for you.""Speaker 1: Thank you.""Speaker 2: Really going to miss you.""Speaker 1: Me too. I'll write to you once I get settled. But I have so much to do. You might have to wait a while. But I really will write to you. I love to write letters. I think it's more meaning than the emails even than the phone call.""Speaker 2: Ok. Take care. Have a nice journey.""Speaker 2: No. I don't think that's possible. Some places are sure to be open.""Speaker 1: But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money.""Speaker 2: Mmm, You may be right.""Speaker 1: Do you think we'll need our overcoats?""Speaker 2: No. We couldn't possibly.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: It will be summer. So it will be hot.""Speaker 1: Is that very likely in England?""Speaker 2: Wow! How high-class... A new pair for each day...""Speaker 1: You just pop'em in in the morning, Take them out at night, And then throw them away. No cleaning!""Speaker 2: Cool. So are you near-sighted or far-sighted?""Speaker 2: Well, I didn't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found his extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! We have so much in common. We like the same teams, Music, A.""Speaker 1: It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?""Speaker 2: There's nothing definite I think. I don't have a list or anything, But when I first meet somebody, I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend. It seems I have radar h.""Speaker 2: I major in Japanese.""Speaker 1: What do you think of the literature course.""Speaker 2: We did, But since she started her new job, All she does is hang out with her new friends from work.""Speaker 1: Can't you hang out with them, Too?""Speaker 2: I could, But all they ever talk about is work, So I always end up feeling left out.""Speaker 1: Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, So it's just the two of you.""Speaker 2: I like peach blossom, Because I like spring.""Speaker 1: Peach blossom is really beautiful.""Speaker 2: Yes. How about you?""Speaker 1: I like lotus.""Speaker 2: You have a perfect taste!""Speaker 1: But there aren't any lotus now.""Speaker 2: Yes. It's snowing outside. Let's enjoy the plum blossoms.""Speaker 2: I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it.""Speaker 1: So, Is that a yes?""Speaker 2: Yes. What time does it start and do you want to meet me there?""Speaker 1: It starts at one and yea, Let's meet there. It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main.""Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Hey, Don't worry about the dinner. We'll do it some other time. But you take care of yourself.""Speaker 2: It has fresh air, And it is nicer than a big town.""Speaker 1: I disagree, A big town is more lively.""Speaker 2: But I like the small mountain village. The big town is noisy. How charming it is when walking along the hill!""Speaker 2: Not really. But it has puzzled me for a long time.""Speaker 1: What's the puzzle?""Speaker 2: My husband and I prefer to have no kids, But my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way.""Speaker 2: Yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night.""Speaker 1: Oh, Really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.""Speaker 2: But they won't! I checked the seller's history, And he got good reviews from other buyers.""Speaker 1: What if he had his friends fake the reviews?""Speaker 2: There you go.""Speaker 1: I don't think that you're done.""Speaker 2: What's wrong?""Speaker 1: My hair looks hideous.""Speaker 2: What's so bad about it?""Speaker 1: It doesn't look good at all.""Speaker 2: Sorry about that.""Speaker 1: I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this.""Speaker 2: Madam, Patience is a virtue.""Speaker 1: Oh, Gosh! I have to go to the restroom so bad! I can't bear it anymore!""Speaker 2: I'm sure a spot will open up soon.""Speaker 2: I told you we should have stayed in town today. The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow. Why did you want to come up here?""Speaker 1: I wanted to show you the cabin. We only had another half-hour to go.""Speaker 2: Well, Now we're stuck. What can we do?""Speaker 1: I don't know.""Speaker 2: That's good.""Speaker 1: ( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr. Bellow and hands into him. ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail, Mr. Bellow.""Speaker 2: Maybe you are right. But the major is not fit for me. I like architecture more than computers.""Speaker 1: But this chance is really precious.""Speaker 2: Well, I know. So I am thinking now.""Speaker 1: I hope you can make a clever choice. Anyway, The opportunities around you are not that By.""Speaker 2: God knows. Speaking of chores, I would rather do some washing than cooking.""Speaker 1: For me, I think I will iron my shirt and trousers. Actually, Weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week.""Speaker 2: I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights. But... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them.""Speaker 2: I'Ve heard this one before.""Speaker 1: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time!""Speaker 2: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.""Speaker 2: Sure, I've been meaning to visit that place myself.""Speaker 1: I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm.""Speaker 2: Ok, Can I bring a date with me?""Speaker 1: Certainly. But if there are going to be four of us, I had better make reservations.""Speaker 2: Yes. That is a very good idea. It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit.""Speaker 1: Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four.""Speaker 2: Soda or water?""Speaker 1: Just plain water with plenty of ice rock.""Speaker 2: Would you want to live there?""Speaker 1: I think his house is fantastic, But I wouldn't want to live there. You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house, Plus a few people to take care of the gardens, And probably an au pair or two to take care of the children. It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own.""Speaker 2: What's your dreamhole like then?""Speaker 2: Light music and classic music.""Speaker 1: Really? I can't believe this. I am also keen on classic music. And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening?""Speaker 2: But I didn't get the ticket. And it is said that they were sold out yesterday.""Speaker 1: I got two. We can go there together.""Speaker 2: I surely am. But still there is one single problem.""Speaker 1: What's that?""Speaker 2: I eat more and more these days. And it puts even more weight on me.""Speaker 1: It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning. What about trying something else?""Speaker 2: I'd love to do that. What do you recommend?""Speaker 1: More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days. Do you want to have a try?""Speaker 2: Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation?""Speaker 2: Yeah. You know what Dave just said?""Speaker 1: What?""Speaker 2: He said I should put on something very nice, Because this girl will be my next target.""Speaker 1: He knows you very well.""Speaker 2: He always makes fun of me. He always says things like that. You know the new coming teacher, A Chinese Canadian. He said she would really be my chance.""Speaker 1: I'm sure you have chances everywhere. You're handsome, Talkative, And got a sense of humor. You must be very popular.""Speaker 2: No, She is an English teacher.""Speaker 1: And who's the man in the green beside her?""Speaker 2: No, But I'm planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon. I'Ve heard that they are beautiful countries. Which is the most beautiful country you'Ve been to?""Speaker 1: I think I'd say Norway. It has many pictures as fjords, Waterfalls, And mountains.""Speaker 2: Isn't it really cold there?""Speaker 2: I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day.""Speaker 1: What about sunday?""Speaker 2: I wish I could, But it's mymums birthday.""Speaker 1: Maybe next week.""Speaker 2: Much as I'd like to, I am afraid i wont be free next week, I have a lot of work.""Speaker 1: Sorry to hear that, I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you, I really enjoyed our last chat.""Speaker 2: Poor boy. They work hard at school nowadays, Don't they? Does he like it?""Speaker 1: School, You mean? Yes, He does. He likes his teachers, And that always makes difference.""Speaker 2: Yes, It does. Does he go to school by bus?""Speaker 1: No, He walks. He likes walking. He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together.""Speaker 2: Oh, My mother is a German, So I can speak German.""Speaker 1: Oh, Do you like Chinese?""Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm eager to learn Chinese, But it is too difficult for me.""Speaker 1: I want to study German. Can we exchange lessons?""Speaker 2: Very Good. I'd like to do that.""Speaker 1: When will we begin?""Speaker 2: How about tomorrow night?""Speaker 2: Of course I do.""Speaker 1: Then, Do you know her younger sister?""Speaker 2: You mean Mary?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: Sure. I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary.""Speaker 1: Oh, Not bad. Then do you know her mother?""Speaker 2: Yes, Certainly. I know her mother and father, And brother and sisters, Too.""Speaker 1: That sounds terrific.""Speaker 2: Why do you ask me these questions?""Speaker 2: I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach. I want to rent one.""Speaker 1: Have you done windsurfing before?""Speaker 2: No, But it looks fun. I always wanted to try it.""Speaker 1: Can you take a little advice from a friend?""Speaker 2: Sure. What?""Speaker 1: Don't waste your money. Windsurfing is very hard. And it will be windy today. They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour, And you won't be able to windsurf. You will fall and fall and fall.""Speaker 2: But I always wanted to try it.""Speaker 2: But it wasn't just you who was involved, Right? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do.""Speaker 1: That's true, But my supervisor is very dishonest. There's no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth. I'm sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault, And there's nothing I can do about that. My boss won't believe me if I tell him the truth.""Speaker 2: Let's think realistically about what might happen. How much money do you have in your savings?""Speaker 2: Tell me which building it's in.""Speaker 1: My class is in the C building.""Speaker 2: I know where the C building is.""Speaker 1: Do you mind telling me where it is?""Speaker 2: Of course, Which room number is it?""Speaker 1: Number 261.""Speaker 2: I actually have a class right around there.""Speaker 1: Can you please show me?""Speaker 2: So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha?""Speaker 1: I heard about a software program called turbid. It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction.""Speaker 2: I'm planning on living with my parents. Won't you?""Speaker 1: I couldn't even if I wanted to. My parents told me that if I went home, Then'd have to find my own place.""Speaker 2: You mean they're kicking you out?""Speaker 1: Not really, They just don't want me living at home. My older sister did that, And she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, It got harder and harder for her to move out.""Speaker 2: Well, It's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with, But they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so.""Speaker 2: I'm afraid not, George. You gotta know something, I'm not available any more. But I know Becky has a crush on ya.""Speaker 2: But that makes thirteen people! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!""Speaker 1: Why can't we?""Speaker 2: It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, Then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, And I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon.""Speaker 2: Sounds interesting!""Speaker 1: Absolutely, I love temple fairs. Beijing has several temple fairs recently. They are different from each other to some extent, But also have a lot in common.""Speaker 2: I just can't wait to see them. Which one do you choose today?""Speaker 2: What's the matter?""Speaker 1: My daughter isn't feeling well.""Speaker 2: Oh, No. Is it serious?""Speaker 1: I don't know. Will you forgive me?""Speaker 2: Of course. I'm sorry for your daughter.""Speaker 1: Thank you. It's our first date. I hope it's not too offensive.""Speaker 2: I know. I already tried to register for it by phone, But the computer won't let me.""Speaker 1: That's because it's full.""Speaker 2: But I'm a new student here. I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class. I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office.""Speaker 1: Well, I could put you on a waiting list. But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class. What is your name?""Speaker 2: He's very nice, Actually, But rather eccentric.""Speaker 1: Really? I love eccentric people.""Speaker 2: Yes, But he may be too eccentric even for you.""Speaker 1: Why? What do you mean by that?""Speaker 2: Well, Haven't you heard?""Speaker 1: Heard what? No one ever tells me anything.""Speaker 2: Well, Apparently, He's been having an affair with his secretary.""Speaker 1: Really! How fascinating.""Speaker 2: I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked, 'Where is your home?'.""Speaker 1: Then he sent you to your home?""Speaker 2: Yeah.""Speaker 1: It's a romantic meeting. I can say that a hero saves a beauty.""Speaker 2: He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant.""Speaker 2: Yeah, But I can speak English, Too.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. What other languages can you speak?""Speaker 2: A little French.""Speaker 2: Yes, Ma'am. No magazines during the office hours. I'm sorry.""Speaker 1: Well, Don't do this again next time. What is it about, Anyway?""Speaker 2: It is about sports for white-collar workers, People like you and me.""Speaker 1: What kind of sports?""Speaker 2: Aerobic sports, For example, Jogging, Yoga, Skating...""Speaker 1: Interesting. What were you reading just now?""Speaker 2: Stretching exercise after sitting a long time.""Speaker 2: What a pity!""Speaker 1: Do you like NBA?""Speaker 2: Yes, Of course.""Speaker 1: Who do you like best of the NBA players?""Speaker 2: Kobe.""Speaker 1: So do I.""Speaker 2: Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight, Shall we?""Speaker 2: I know the perfect place!""Speaker 1: Good! Where is it?""Speaker 2: It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you?""Speaker 1: That would be great.""Speaker 2: Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants?""Speaker 1: The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything. And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation.""Speaker 2: Actually, We are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time. Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars, But they have looked at various designs.""Speaker 2: Well, Let's see. I'd like to go to see the Summer Palace.""Speaker 2: That will be Monday, December 2nd. We need to start loading the buses half an hour early, So plan to arrive at 7.""Speaker 1: Yes, I will be there on time.""Speaker 2: We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up?""Speaker 1: Yes, Someone is coming to get me.""Speaker 2: The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p.M. And return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p.M.""Speaker 2: Ok.""Speaker 1: Mr. : Right here is the cafeteria.""Speaker 2: It's huge!""Speaker 1: Mr. : But not big enough. And here is our computer room.""Speaker 2: There must be about 50 computers in here.""Speaker 1: Mr. : And over here is our gymnasium.""Speaker 2: Do I have to take gym?""Speaker 2: I hope it's not gonna break into three digits.""Speaker 1: But it's already awfully close.""Speaker 2: Well, I just hope it'll level off.""Speaker 1: I guess you can't do anything until after dark then.""Speaker 2: That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there?""Speaker 1: I'm not really in the mood for Italian, Actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.""Speaker 2: If you want spicy food, Then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road?""Speaker 1: I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, They've westernized their food, So it's not actually that spicy.""Speaker 2: Well, In the afternoon, After a long nap, We'll go yachting with Nora.""Speaker 1: It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow.""Speaker 2: How about you? What are you going to do tomorrow?""Speaker 2: See your problem? You get so restless when it's time to calm down.""Speaker 2: Oh, I took a shine to him when we met for the first time. But it comes and goes.""Speaker 2: Ok, But don't believe everything you see on The X-files, Either!""Speaker 2: I'm Charlie. Nice to meet you.""Speaker 1: Nice to meet you, Too.""Speaker 2: Since we live in the same neighbourhood, Maybe we can help each other from now on.""Speaker 1: I guess so. I live next door but one, And hope you'll drop in now and then.""Speaker 2: Although the weather here is very cold, The people are warm.""Speaker 2: No, Not really. I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight, But we can't unless we rush it. Let's stay in Bremen instead. Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg, Then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there.""Speaker 1: Sounds fine to me. Whatever, Let's enjoy this pond first.""Speaker 2: She even stayed at a different hotel. She said I might be contagious.""Speaker 2: I always knew she was the one, But I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I'm just debating on how to do it.""Speaker 1: That's exciting, Man.""Speaker 2: So how did you propose?""Speaker 1: You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now.""Speaker 2: What do you think I should do?""Speaker 1: There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, Or ask her in a public area, Or if you have the balls, Ask her father in front of her.""Speaker 2: She is a beautiful bride.""Speaker 1: I am so happy for them.""Speaker 2: Are you crying?""Speaker 1: Yes, I always cry at weddings.""Speaker 2: Harris and Anne are perfect for each other.""Speaker 1: Yes, They are.""Speaker 2: You and Tom also make a great couple.""Speaker 1: In fact, We are beginning to make preparations.""Speaker 2: For the wedding?""Speaker 1: No, No, For the engagement.""Speaker 2: Yes, It must be used for grinding coffee beans.""Speaker 2: Just alive? I guess you are some lucky guy. I heard you are going out with Jane.""Speaker 1: Where did you get that idea?""Speaker 2: Oh, Come on. Jane is a very nice girl, Someone you meet only once till lifetime.""Speaker 1: You are right. I am not boasting, But she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent.""Speaker 2: Waiter!""Speaker 1: Yes, Sir. I'll bring your drink right away.""Speaker 2: It's not that. There's an animal in my soup.""Speaker 1: Is there, Sir? I'm very sorry. I'll change it straight away.""Speaker 2: I've never been to such a dirty restaurant, And never seen such slow service.""Speaker 2: You said it.""Speaker 1: This city is really comfortable to living.""Speaker 2: It sure is.""Speaker 1: No other city can match it. It's heaven.""Speaker 2: Well, If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much.""Speaker 2: She's a friend of Amy. We met at Amy's birthday party.""Speaker 1: Is this your first date?""Speaker 2: Yes. I hope it pans out. Cross your fingers, Lily.""Speaker 1: Sure it will. Oh, No, It's seven fifteen already. I'm going to be late for my date.""Speaker 2: Oh... So you buried the hatchet with Steven?""Speaker 1: Absolutely not! He's a cheater. I will never talk to him again. I'm over with him. He's history!""Speaker 2: Who are those kids walking down the aisle?""Speaker 1: That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, They look so cute!""Speaker 2: I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.""Speaker 1: That's all you ever think about, Food! Oh, I think the bride's coming now! She looks gorgeous. Wait, What's she doing? Where's she going?""Speaker 2: Whatever am i going to tell me parents.""Speaker 1: Don't worry about that, I am sure they will understand. After all, It was a very difficult exam.""Speaker 2: What am I to do?""Speaker 2: I'm not sure, He is a manager I think.""Speaker 1: Really? Are you going to introduce us?""Speaker 2: You see,. This time I traveled to the West. When I looked out of the windows of the rain, All the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone.""Speaker 2: Teresa Jones got a boob job.""Speaker 1: Uh, I can see that. And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight.""Speaker 2: Maybe, But I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese.""Speaker 1: Yes, I guess basic speaking in the English is easier.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I know.""Speaker 1: I want to know where this relationship is going. I'm in love with you and I need to know...""Speaker 2: You know, I think you're awesome.""Speaker 1: I'm awesome. Well, I guess that's my answer, Isn't it.""Speaker 2: Honey...""Speaker 1: Look, If you don't love me, It's not a thing, Alright, We'Ve had our laughs, But I don't appreciate... Maybe it's just time we...""Speaker 2: Baby, I love you so much.""Speaker 2: Oh, Parker with a P?""Speaker 1: Yes, With a P.""Speaker 2: Er... I'm Barker.""Speaker 1: Barker? With a B. Of course.""Speaker 2: Yes, With a B.""Speaker 1: Won't you come in, Mr. Barker?""Speaker 2: We have a rather comprehensive subway system here. We can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway. Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy.""Speaker 1: Where do we pay the fare?""Speaker 2: Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token. Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in.""Speaker 1: Let me pay for it.""Speaker 2: No way. I will be scared out of my wits.""Speaker 1: Well, What kind of movies do you like?""Speaker 2: Er, Let me see. Romance, Comedy, Documentary, Action, Science fiction, Cartoon and so on.""Speaker 1: In a word, You like all the movies except for the horror movies.""Speaker 2: Yeah, It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned.""Speaker 1: Not quite. I also like romance and comedy movies very much.""Speaker 2: Yes. I commute five days a week by train.""Speaker 1: And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service?""Speaker 2: It's really very good.""Speaker 1: Why do you say that?""Speaker 2: Well, Trains are frequent and come on time.""Speaker 1: Which train do you catch in the evening?""Speaker 2: I usually take the 5 thirty home.""Speaker 1: And can you get a seat?""Speaker 2: No, I usually have to stand.""Speaker 2: Have you noticed what has changed?""Speaker 1: Oh, You look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?""Speaker 2: Yes. I'm on a diet, But I'Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I'Ve lost twelve pounds.""Speaker 1: Wow! That's great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, But it's difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, Old habits are hard to break.""Speaker 2: Yes, Very good.""Speaker 1: What advantages does it have?""Speaker 2: It is very convenient. You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time.""Speaker 1: Yes, If we do business through other ways, It will cost a lot of time.""Speaker 2: Also it has low cost, And you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet, Which is very cheap.""Speaker 1: Yes, Going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much. But does it have any disadvantages?""Speaker 2: Do we get a day off from school then?""Speaker 2: She is tired, But getting a lot of rest now.""Speaker 1: That's good to hear.""Speaker 2: I'm just glad there were no complications.""Speaker 1: If your wife and baby are both happy, What more can you ask for?""Speaker 2: It's been a week, And I haven't slept that well.""Speaker 1: That's normal for anyone with a newborn.""Speaker 2: Yeah, But it's so hard. I have to work, And then go home and take care of my wife and the baby. I'm going to get sick at this rate.""Speaker 1: You'll get used to it. After everything stabilizes, You can regain your health.""Speaker 2: He's really good looking. He's quite tall, Around 61, He's in his early thirties, And he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes...""Speaker 1: He sounds hot! What does he do for a living?""Speaker 2: You know what, This is the best part. David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, So he's got a great career path ahead of him!""Speaker 1: Hold on a sec, His name is David?""Speaker 2: I'd like to.""Speaker 1: Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning.""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: But some classmates said you took the money.""Speaker 2: It is not true.""Speaker 1: Look at my eyes.""Speaker 2: Well, I confess. I did it, Because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill. I'm ashamed that I did that.""Speaker 1: Return the money to Jim and make an apology. I think he will forgive you.""Speaker 2: What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It's brand new!""Speaker 1: Well missy, The white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.""Speaker 2: Ugh... So how long is this going to take? An hour?""Speaker 2: Where is it?""Speaker 1: It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing, In a park with the same name. There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer, So it is called 'Fragrant Mountain'.""Speaker 2: Have you visited it before?""Speaker 1: Many times. Except climbing, There are many attractions worth visiting.""Speaker 2: Like what?""Speaker 2: I guess I never thought of that before.""Speaker 1: And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, Or from the government.""Speaker 2: Well, I'Ve been working so hard lately, So I'll probably just take it easy.""Speaker 1: Sounds nice.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll probably just stay in and relax. Maybe watch a few movies.""Speaker 1: Can I stop by?""Speaker 2: Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company.""Speaker 1: Really? I'm surprised.""Speaker 2: My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.""Speaker 1: In fact, I took up dancing quite recently, Too.""Speaker 2: Oh, Really? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well.""Speaker 1: I'm glad you say so, You dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments. It's just that you are a good leader. Do you like thesamba and waltz?""Speaker 1: Yes. And what dances do you like best?""Speaker 2: I want to check this magazine out.""Speaker 1: We don't allow people to check out magazines.""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 1: It's just a policy of ours.""Speaker 2: So what am I allowed to check out?""Speaker 1: You may check out books or videos.""Speaker 2: I need to check out this magazine.""Speaker 1: You will have to just read it in the library.""Speaker 2: Sounds interesting. Who are the other people?""Speaker 1: Fred and David, My college class mates and Rachel.""Speaker 2: Gorgeous! What should I bring on that day?""Speaker 1: Your tent and enough food and water.""Speaker 2: You mean, We can do many other things after the picnic, Right?""Speaker 1: We can go fishing, Chatting and camping.""Speaker 2: What are we waiting for? Come on!""Speaker 2: Camping for an evening is ok, But I couldn't do it for much longer than one night!""Speaker 1: Have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters?""Speaker 2: No, But I've always wanted to do that. I've heard it's a beautiful place to go.""Speaker 1: It's fantastic. My family and I are very fond of the place.""Speaker 2: Do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there?""Speaker 2: About three times a week if I can.""Speaker 1: Not bad! Do you do any other sports?""Speaker 2: That's hard to say... I think Ottawa is prettier. It has better sightseeing, Too. A lot of museums and galleries.""Speaker 1: And what's Montreal like? What did you think of it?""Speaker 2: Montreal is more exciting. It has better shopping. The stores are cheaper and more interesting.""Speaker 1: Which one has better nightlife?""Speaker 2: Oh, She likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class. She doesn't mind your making mistakes, Though.""Speaker 2: How do you find studying a language on the internet?""Speaker 1: It's not easy, Particularly with listening and speaking, Because sometimes the connection isn't too good.""Speaker 2: I bet you find the character difficult to write!""Speaker 2: Will you be able to make up the work you missed?""Speaker 1: I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.""Speaker 2: Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester.""Speaker 1: Yes, I remember.""Speaker 2: Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder?""Speaker 1: Sure, No problem.""Speaker 2: Most public schools in the United States are very good, And the majority of students attend the public schools.""Speaker 1: Which students go to private schools, Then?""Speaker 2: Children needing special instruction. Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools, And children whose parents want them to receive a religious education.""Speaker 2: Oh, How awful. What a terrible thing to do.""Speaker 1: I agree completely. I just don't understand what's wrong with them. Don't they have any humanity?""Speaker 2: Well, Maybe they've got a point. I mean, I suspect that they think the same about us.""Speaker 1: Yes, But that doesn't make them right, Does it? Just because they think so?""Speaker 2: I guess not. My view is that we should give in to their demands, So that innocent people can stop getting killed.""Speaker 1: Come on, You can't be serious! We should never give in to terrorist's demands, Otherwise where would we be?""Speaker 2: Very well, Thank you. I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12, Would you care to join us?""Speaker 2: Yes, It is, Isn't it? A bit too light, Really. What make have you got?""Speaker 1: I've got an old Ericsson. Here. Take a look.""Speaker 2: Wow, That's really old.""Speaker 1: Yes, I like collecting antiques.""Speaker 2: Why don't you get a new one?""Speaker 1: I don't know. I like this one, And I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones.""Speaker 2: Really, What makes you say that?""Speaker 2: You do know that it's absolutely freezing out, Don't you? I'd put a coat on if I were you.""Speaker 1: It wasn't cold out this morning.""Speaker 2: Well, It's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there!""Speaker 1: Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you?""Speaker 2: It does, Actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.""Speaker 2: I'Ve prepared most of it already and we'Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know, Crisps, Biscuits, And things. Are you going to make the punch?""Speaker 1: Yes. I'Ve bought all the things to go in it. It won't take long to make. How many people are coming to the party?""Speaker 2: I think everyone will be coming. Dave don't come because he has to go to his parent's home and they live in Scotland.""Speaker 2: They have made it. Will our love last 50 years?""Speaker 2: Wait. We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed.""Speaker 1: Is that right?""Speaker 2: Our homeroom teacher has to take attendance again to make sure that we're all here.""Speaker 1: So he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon.""Speaker 2: In 1978. I went to college here.""Speaker 1: Oh. What was your major?""Speaker 2: Drama. I was an actor for five years after college.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. So why did you become a hairdresser?""Speaker 2: Neither of us is very religious, So we decided not to get married there.""Speaker 1: Have you booked the hotel for the reception?""Speaker 2: Yes. The Palace Hotel. You have to be there.""Speaker 2: Sure. But it is too cold today. I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid.""Speaker 2: Thanks. That would be very helpful. I'Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want. There's too much information on the net.""Speaker 1: When you sent your emails, Did you attach any files to them?""Speaker 2: Yes, I did. There's an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments, So I'm sure I haven't sent anything nasty to anyone.""Speaker 2: Nice to meet you, George. I'm Irene.""Speaker 1: So Irene, What do you do?""Speaker 2: I'm in computing. I work for Macrohard.""Speaker 1: Macrohard, Eh?""Speaker 2: What do you do?""Speaker 2: Ok, I'll find the time to relax soon.""Speaker 2: In gymnastics. I'm pretty flexible. Look! I can even touch my toes!""Speaker 1: Can you do the vault?""Speaker 2: Well, Good-bye. See you soon.""Speaker 2: Oh, He's really reserved, Normally. But, From what I hear, He's got lots of problems.""Speaker 1: Really? What kind of problems?""Speaker 2: Well, Off the record, Of course, But I hear that he's got terrible debts. He has his own company, And it's not going very well.""Speaker 1: Really? Well, I hate to say this, But I'm not surprised.""Speaker 2: Really? What makes you say that?""Speaker 1: Well, He doesn't look very honest.""Speaker 2: Do you have a cold?""Speaker 1: No. Worse than that. I have a flu. I'm in bed with a fever.""Speaker 2: Oh, No! What about your presentation today?""Speaker 1: I'd like to do it, Of course. But I just can't. I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it.""Speaker 2: I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley?""Speaker 1: Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.""Speaker 2: Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?""Speaker 1: Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out. Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that.""Speaker 2: Do you think I should wear a different dress?""Speaker 1: No, The one you have on looks fabulous, Especially with your hair like that.""Speaker 2: Thanks for saying. Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear?""Speaker 1: With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect.""Speaker 2: Thanks for helping out. Now that I'm ready, What are you doing tonight?""Speaker 2: It gives me great satisfaction.""Speaker 1: Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work.""Speaker 2: Good idea.""Speaker 1: Since we're good friends, You don't have to pay me.""Speaker 2: She is a grow-up. She can make her own decision.""Speaker 2: Who were you talking to?""Speaker 1: Um — I was just thinking aloud.""Speaker 2: You look so happy. I see a twinkle in your eyes.""Speaker 1: Come off it, Mary.""Speaker 2: Oh, You have a crush on someone, Don't you? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes!""Speaker 1: You certainly do like teasing me, Mary. Well I'm in love with someone. The question is, How do I get his attention?""Speaker 2: Well, That's easy. Walk up to him and kiss him.""Speaker 2: Let's hit the whirlpool for a bit. It'll help me loosen up.""Speaker 2: It's really not necessary. I know your intention was good.""Speaker 2: Yes. I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted.""Speaker 1: Just because he gets on well with everybody?""Speaker 2: Hmm. Well, In that case, We could go to the movies.""Speaker 1: Oh, We always go to the movies. Can't we do something different?""Speaker 2: Well, Do you have any suggestions?""Speaker 1: Let's see. How do you feel about playing bridge?""Speaker 2: It's OK with me, But we don't have any beer and things.""Speaker 2: We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot.""Speaker 1: I didn't know that. I thought that you were happy together.""Speaker 2: That isn't true. Actually, We have been separated for six months.""Speaker 1: I can't believe it. But if you both determine to divorce, I hope you will have an amicable split.""Speaker 2: Thank you, Steven. I accept your advice.""Speaker 2: I am not sure. You can search for them on the Internet.""Speaker 1: Ok. Look, I've typed driver schools, And there are so many results coming out.""Speaker 2: Let me see. Teetee Training School, Summer program, 3, 000 Yuan, Learn how to drive within one month, And get driver's license within three months.""Speaker 1: 3, 000 Yuan is a little bit steep.""Speaker 2: Many kinds of books. When I was a child in elementary school, I enjoyed reading fables and science fiction. When I became to a teenager at middle school, I was interested in detective mystery stories. Now I like reading romance stories.""Speaker 1: Are you in love?""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories.""Speaker 2: Sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes.""Speaker 1: Well, I really like being with her.""Speaker 2: Have you thought about going in Dutch?""Speaker 1: Dutch, Where is that?""Speaker 2: Not where, What. Dutch means you both pay your own way.""Speaker 2: Is there something you need?""Speaker 1: Are your free this weekend?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have nothing to do.""Speaker 1: Great, Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend?""Speaker 2: I beg your pardon?""Speaker 1: I'd like to call on you this weekend. I just want to a drop in for a chat.""Speaker 2: Really? Well, Ok, You're welcome.""Speaker 1: Is 5 PM. A good time for you?""Speaker 2: It's the only perk of this job! How's your day going?""Speaker 1: Not that well. I've got that Monday morning feeling today.""Speaker 2: Why is that?""Speaker 1: My boss has been breathing down my neck all day. I can't wait for the weekend!""Speaker 2: Your boss is a real salve-driver, Isn't he?""Speaker 1: You can say that again! He won't even let us check our personal email at work!""Speaker 2: Thanks. But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set.""Speaker 1: Can I help in anyway?""Speaker 2: You can take me to the bank if you want to.""Speaker 2: What do you think we can see during the festival?""Speaker 1: I don't know what to suggest. There're so many attractions, And they all sound interesting. One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town. You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations.""Speaker 2: I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park.""Speaker 2: There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan, Besides auction websites.""Speaker 1: I use those sites. Hey! Let's go check out a flea market later.""Speaker 2: Don't say that. It looks like a dump now. I can't stand it.""Speaker 1: Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet?""Speaker 2: Unfortunately, Yes.""Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?""Speaker 2: I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station. It took me 20 minutes.""Speaker 1: Yes, But you only pay 800 dollars a month. Emm, It's hard to decide which is better, Shorter commuting time or lower rent.""Speaker 2: Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?""Speaker 1: I ride a motorcycle.""Speaker 2: That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card?""Speaker 1: I'll use a credit card, Thank you.""Speaker 2: Do you need a second permit for a car?""Speaker 1: No, Just the motorcycle permit.""Speaker 2: You can't peek! This is a surprise.""Speaker 1: How about one little hint?""Speaker 2: Here's one little hint. If you don't go out right now, This won't be under the tree.""Speaker 1: That's a very good hint.""Speaker 2: I had to go by myself, He couldn't make it.""Speaker 1: What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, He said he was coming.""Speaker 2: Kitty's? He sure gets around, Doesn't he?""Speaker 1: Looks like it. So how did he handle it to?""Speaker 2: His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again.""Speaker 1: I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.""Speaker 2: I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy.""Speaker 2: Not too well. He had to have four teeth pulled last week.""Speaker 1: He did? That's too bad!""Speaker 2: I think so, Too.""Speaker 1: Next time you see him, Please tell him I'm thinking of him.""Speaker 2: Chill out. It's just Kenny from South Park.""Speaker 1: What park? You found a doll in a park? Gross!""Speaker 2: South Park is a popular cartoon. You're so out of it, Jen.""Speaker 2: Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something? He got arrested for that, Didn't he?""Speaker 1: He got arrested all right.""Speaker 2: If I remember, He got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison.""Speaker 1: Yup, That's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.""Speaker 2: I think the government fined him a small amount, And he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire.""Speaker 2: But some people use this occasion to create trouble. Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth.""Speaker 2: Why not start with the most interesting one?""Speaker 1: Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, The harder to make a decision.""Speaker 2: Oh, He is all right. But busy as usual. Well, Why don't we have a good chat at a bar? It's been long time since we met each other last time.""Speaker 2: Thank you for the invitation.""Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Can I get you another glass of champagne?""Speaker 2: Yes, I'd love another glass. You're a wonderful host. Thank you for everything.""Speaker 2: Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?""Speaker 1: We will need it for Saturday only.""Speaker 2: I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?""Speaker 1: Mary and I will be driving the van.""Speaker 2: Could you drop it off on Sunday night?""Speaker 1: Yes, We can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?""Speaker 2: Oh, I see.""Speaker 1: Come on, Dear. I know you mustn't forget it.""Speaker 2: It's Saturday, A great weekend.""Speaker 1: Ur, You really let me down.""Speaker 2: Don't be angry with me. I have a bad memory.""Speaker 1: No, You haven't. You just don't care about me. You're an indifferent husband.""Speaker 2: What day is it on earth?""Speaker 2: Yes, But I don't think they are enough for me.""Speaker 1: Oh, Maybe you can find something from the New York Times, Or the Washington Post during that period.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. Thanks a lot.""Speaker 2: You are still wet behind the ears. You should have seen through her.""Speaker 2: I was there for about three weeks.""Speaker 1: That's a long time! Was the weather OK?""Speaker 2: Yes, Most of the time. But it snowed a lot in Chicago.""Speaker 1: So, What was the best thing about your trip?""Speaker 2: It also helps that I have strong team members, Such as yourself. You really know your stuff!""Speaker 2: Because it's off-season, We got a really good package deal to Paris, So we went there.""Speaker 1: I've always wanted to go to Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top?""Speaker 2: That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them?""Speaker 1: Sure. What's this one a picture of?""Speaker 2: Yes. She goes three times a week.""Speaker 1: Why? What does she want to be?""Speaker 2: She wants to be a manager.""Speaker 1: What classes does she take?""Speaker 2: No. She is really a very nice girl...""Speaker 1: Yeah, She is. She is pretty, Caring, Getting easy-going and she is a great cook. She is a gem.""Speaker 2: Well, You are right. But sometimes she is too caring. Well, No... She's just possessive and I kind of want a break... You know... For some room for myself.""Speaker 1: Oh?! Did you talk with her about it?""Speaker 2: Oh, Then it's my honor to be here with you. I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar. You like this place?""Speaker 1: Sure. I love this place, Especially the decoration. So tasteful!""Speaker 2: Yeah. Other than that, The real feature is the excellent drinks. Can I have your ticket?""Speaker 2: It includes a lot of useful words and phrases.""Speaker 2: Oh, Just olives please. What music is this?""Speaker 1: Do you like it? It's Irish music.""Speaker 2: It's great! Where did you get the CD?""Speaker 1: Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall. Have you been there?""Speaker 2: Yes. I buy a lot of stuff from there. It's a good shop, Isn't it?""Speaker 1: Yes. Hey, I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland. Would you like to see them?""Speaker 2: Las Vegas. I find gambling relaxing. I don't take it seriously, The way some people do. Besides, I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town. The casinos never close, You know.""Speaker 2: It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet.""Speaker 1: What did you do last week?""Speaker 2: We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff. It was very exciting.""Speaker 1: Wow! That sounds like a lot of fun. I'm sorry I missed it.""Speaker 2: Well, You should come this weekend. I think you could do the climb.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I will. See you then!""Speaker 2: Have you found anything yet?""Speaker 1: You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year?""Speaker 2: You should be able to find something comfortable in town, Though that would be kind of far from school.""Speaker 1: I got a car, So the distance wouldn't really be a problem.""Speaker 2: Can I ask you a question?""Speaker 1: Sure, What do you want to know?""Speaker 2: I have my book from class here. How do you say this word?""Speaker 1: Laptop.""Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't understand. What does that mean?""Speaker 1: A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you. Do you understand?""Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. Can you say it again?""Speaker 2: You don't believe that? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way. To some people, The Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort.""Speaker 1: What do you believe, John? Are you Christian?""Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I don't know if I'm a Christian or not. Christians don't often share the same belief. But I believe that we all possess, By the grace of God, The potential to create fantastic changes on this earth.""Speaker 1: Do you believe that one religion is better than another?""Speaker 2: Oh. That's really annoying when seeing a film.""Speaker 2: Maurice Richard has the puck now, And passes it to the center. He shoots! Wow what a save by the goalie!""Speaker 2: Well, Let's make it this way. For comparison, 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles.""Speaker 2: Who can't make it in your family?""Speaker 1: My sister. She is going to her in-law's house this year.""Speaker 2: That's too bad. So, What did you ask for Christmas this year?""Speaker 1: I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games.""Speaker 2: I want some computer games also. I gave my parents a really long Christmas list.""Speaker 1: I hope that I get what I asked for.""Speaker 2: How have you been?""Speaker 1: I'm pretty good. I've been looking for a place to live recently. My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the neighborhood. Have you found a place yet?""Speaker 1: Not yet. I am still looking through the classifieds. Wish me luck.""Speaker 2: Well, Maybe I can help. Remember my neighbor?""Speaker 1: Mrs. Thou?""Speaker 2: No, I think it came out of my pocket when I was in the taxi.""Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do?""Speaker 2: Can I borrow some money?""Speaker 1: Sure, How much do you need?""Speaker 2: About 50 dollars.""Speaker 1: That's no problem.""Speaker 2: Thanks. I'll pay you back on Friday.""Speaker 1: That'll be fine. Here you are.""Speaker 2: What are you going to do now?""Speaker 1: I'm going to buy some books and then I'm going to the gas station.""Speaker 2: Sure. Why not?""Speaker 1: Ok, Well, Let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner.""Speaker 2: He's really good looking, He's quite tall, Around 6 '1 ”, He's in his early thirties, And he's got the most beautiful dark brown eyes...""Speaker 1: He sounds hot! What does he do for a living?""Speaker 2: You know what, This is the best part. David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank, So he's got a great career path ahead of him!""Speaker 1: Hold on a sec, His name is David?""Speaker 2: Sure, They do.""Speaker 1: But why do you choose cycling at first?""Speaker 2: Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection.""Speaker 1: You are really a good citizen.""Speaker 2: Did you bow back?""Speaker 1: No, I tried to shake her hand, But her hand was so limp I was a bit offended.""Speaker 2: Well, Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan. She might have been offended by your strong handshake.""Speaker 1: But she was in America! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect?""Speaker 2: Okay. In the middle of their streets there are parks, Big soccer fields as far as you can see.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: That's not all. They use them! Every night men, Women, Children all out there till 3 and 4 a.M.""Speaker 1: Are you serious?""Speaker 2: It must be very convenient and pretty quick.""Speaker 2: Those drug tests don't mean anything! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids.""Speaker 1: Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn't mean all athletes are.""Speaker 2: Ah, I'm going to the pub to watch the football.""Speaker 1: Oh really? I'll come along with you if that's ok.""Speaker 2: Sure, You're more than welcome. I'm meeting everyone at three o 'clock.""Speaker 2: All right. There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third.""Speaker 1: What other expenses will we have?""Speaker 2: She's my little niece. It's her birthday. They're singing \"Happy Birthday\".""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. How old is she?""Speaker 2: She's ten.""Speaker 1: I suppose they're playing games.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. Ellie was playing games all day yesterday. By the way, Alice, When's your birthday?""Speaker 1: Today.""Speaker 2: Today?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: Well, Imagine that! How old are you?""Speaker 1: Eighteen. Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight. Do you want to come?""Speaker 2: I'm not sure. Medium I suppose. Maybe a little on the heavy side.""Speaker 1: Any marks on his face?""Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.""Speaker 1: Glasses?""Speaker 2: No.""Speaker 1: What about his hair?""Speaker 2: Black or dark brown.""Speaker 1: Long or short? Straight? Curly?""Speaker 2: Straight, I think, And about average length.""Speaker 2: Sure, I will. How can I miss that?""Speaker 1: Good. I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror!""Speaker 2: Well, Maybe so. But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion.""Speaker 2: Millions of things. I surf the Net, Check my e-mail, And most importantly, I chat with my friends.""Speaker 1: Online chat? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not?""Speaker 2: No, I am not. And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me.""Speaker 2: Well, I am up to my neck in work. I've got to finish this report. Sarah needs it by noon. I don't want to be scolded if I can't finish my work by the deadline.""Speaker 2: I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.""Speaker 1: What about the expression Goodbye? Is that an idiom?""Speaker 2: That is just a natural, Grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.""Speaker 2: We're having some friends over. What are you doing?""Speaker 2: Criminals are clever? They're only successful when people are careless.""Speaker 1: I don't know. The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good.""Speaker 2: If your uncle had an alarm system, Then it wouldn't have happened.""Speaker 1: He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it. And on a crowded street too.""Speaker 2: Didn't anyone stop them?""Speaker 2: What other features are listed?""Speaker 1: It says that it comes in teal andtangerine.""Speaker 2: Totally cool colors!""Speaker 2: It was a few things. The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary, But she stood me up!""Speaker 1: Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?""Speaker 2: No, But I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home!""Speaker 1: What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her?""Speaker 2: Actually, I am learning that now. But it's too hard for me. You know the four tones and the stuff. It really freaks me out.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. All things are difficult before they are easy.""Speaker 2: You hit the nail right on the head.""Speaker 1: Well, Are you invested in some language-exchange program?""Speaker 2: No, It can't be. Really? Who?""Speaker 1: I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, But staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.""Speaker 2: What did you do?""Speaker 1: I didn't do anything. Finally, He left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.""Speaker 2: Did he leave when you left?""Speaker 2: Mary's father is a rich man, Isn't he?""Speaker 1: You are right, Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement, Costs, Etc. I think he must spend much money.""Speaker 2: Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon?""Speaker 1: Yes. Look! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet.""Speaker 2: Oh, French dressing.""Speaker 1: Sorry, It's not available now. Anything else?""Speaker 2: We still prefer French dressing.""Speaker 1: Will you say it again?""Speaker 2: Yeah.""Speaker 1: How do you feel about that?""Speaker 2: Well, I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months, In Japan. I am going to miss it so much, Cause I've had a great time here.""Speaker 1: Mm, So what are you going to miss about Japan?""Speaker 2: Oh, I am going to miss the people, The food, The night life. Especially the nightlife.""Speaker 1: What especially about the night life are you going to miss?""Speaker 2: Oh, It's so quiet here. We have the park to ourselves, Only you and me!""Speaker 1: Don't you see many people over there? Just on your left.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see them. Some are doing Taijiquan, Some are performing swordplay, Some are practising the Chinese Wushu.""Speaker 2: The housework is really a big problem for me. My husband is on a business trip to the U.S. Now and I have to take care of everything myself.""Speaker 1: How about your one-year-old baby?""Speaker 2: I've asked my parents to live with us for a while, So they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class.""Speaker 2: Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced.""Speaker 1: I can understand. By the way, Is there anyway I can help?""Speaker 2: No, Not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's so great, Bless you! If you need me, I'll always be there.""Speaker 2: Pleased to meet you, Too, Shirley. So, What do you do?""Speaker 1: I work in marketing. I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company. Normally, I work out of Beijing, But I'm here on business.

It was a heavy storm, With lots of thunder.""Speaker 1: I was fast asleep, And didn't hear a thing.""Speaker 2: Well, It may rain again later today.""Speaker 1: Maybe. I see some dark clouds moving in.""Speaker 2: There may also be a strong wind coming in.""Speaker 1: It'll be dusty, Too, I guess.""Speaker 2: Maybe not. Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing.""Speaker 2: No, I have never vacationed anywhere exotic.

Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet?""Speaker 2: Yes, It wasn't too hard to get. All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee.""Speaker 2: Of course it is. In fact, I'll even take the course with you if you want.""Speaker 1: Great! It's always better to do things with a friend.""Speaker 2: Do you have the phone number? I need to call for registration.""Speaker 1: No, I left it at home. Sorry!""Speaker 2: That's OK. I can get it from you later.""Speaker 2: Romantic? I can't remember what that word means.""Speaker 1: Well, You have three kids, So you knew what it meant once upon a time!""Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah, It's terrible. I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China. It's when so many people try to get onto one city bus, And the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt.""Speaker 1: That sounds terrible the way you describe it. But you know, Not long ago I really suffered on the bus.""Speaker 2: Where shall we go now? A Chinese restaurant or a local one?""Speaker 2: Then your salary must be high.""Speaker 1: Just so so. But we can travel twice every year.""Speaker 2: Is this time one of them?""Speaker 1: Yes, We won't travel again until October.""Speaker 2: You won't believe it, But it was really cheap.""Speaker 2: That girl in my econ class. She is so hot.""Speaker 1: Did you guys go on a date already?""Speaker 2: No. I didn't even talk to her yet. But I think I'm in love.""Speaker 1: Does she have a boyfriend?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy.""Speaker 1: Dude, You're a stalker man. Just ask her on a date.""Speaker 2: I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone. I think I'll ask her then.""Speaker 1: So why do you think you're in love?""Speaker 2: Yes. I bought it in Johnson thrift store.""Speaker 1: Is it a used one?""Speaker 2: Yes, It is.""Speaker 2: Tea Ceremony! Tell me about Tea Ceremony.""Speaker 1: Tea Ceremony! It's, There's a certain way you have to make tea, Not only make tea, There's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl.""Speaker 2: I see.""Speaker 1: Yes, With one piece of cloth, And you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl.""Speaker 2: I'd like to conduct some scientific research into genes. It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough.""Speaker 1: There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you. You could do some research for a university. There's a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays. Someone wit.""Speaker 2: Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics, Because there are so many possibilities. Few people know where next discoveries will be made.""Speaker 2: It's too biased. I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting.""Speaker 1: New York Times is better?""Speaker 2: It's called Counter Strike. It's a first person shooter game. It's awesome. It's a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.""Speaker 1: You'Ve been wasting your time on this? I can't believe it! It doesn't even look fun or challenging!""Speaker 2: My laptop is on my bed. If you think it's so easy then get on line and try to beat me.""Speaker 2: Thanks for saying so, But my husband thinks otherwise.""Speaker 2: Cool! I wish I could have been there!""Speaker 1: Me, Too. I miss you. Are you any better?""Speaker 2: Oh, No. Most of the time I do these things. She is a writer.""Speaker 2: I agree. People often criticizeTv for showing too much sex and violence.""Speaker 1: Yeah. And that's so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational!""Speaker 2: Right. You can't blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Definitely! Thanks for inviting me.""Speaker 1: My pleasure.""Speaker 2: I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day, But the pre-sale tickets were sold out. How did you manage to get hold of them?""Speaker 1: A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi, Which is a major sponsor of the movie. He was able to get the tickets for free, And then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece.""Speaker 2: Honey, Listen to me. First, You should learn how to breathe in and breathe out.""Speaker 1: Mom, It's so terrible. Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned.""Speaker 2: Do be patient, Honey. Let's do it slowly and correctly.""Speaker 1: Oh, Mom, I think I'm not the right person for swimming.""Speaker 2: Come on, Sweetie, You've done very well. It is the first step that is tough.""Speaker 2: Just get out of my face!""Speaker 1: Woo, Easy.""Speaker 2: Leave me alone!""Speaker 1: What are you so ticked off about?""Speaker 2: I don't want to talk about it.""Speaker 1: Maybe I could help.""Speaker 2: I blew the finally exam.""Speaker 1: You've got be joking.""Speaker 2: No, I'm not.""Speaker 2: Nice to meet you guys.""Speaker 1: Over there are Stacy and Rebecca.

Oh, Here it is.""Speaker 1: Let me see. Oh yes. Your professor has placed this book on reserve. That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place. You need to go to a special room called the reserve room. It's down the hall and to the right.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry - I still don't understand.""Speaker 2: Look at that big tree over there.""Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh my god! It's still there. We have our first date right on there.""Speaker 2: Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then?""Speaker 1: You seemed to be dull at that time.""Speaker 2: But you agreed to go out with me at last.""Speaker 1: ( Smile ) I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married.""Speaker 2: So do you feel happy now?""Speaker 2: Don't worry, I'll drive you.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much!""Speaker 2: How are your cases coming along?""Speaker 1: Very well, Thanks, I will probably finish next week, But this is still a lot of work, I have been worked on in for six months, And i'm so closed to end.

I am out of style. So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style.""Speaker 2: I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day! Don't you know?""Speaker 1: Oh, God. I just forgot it. I should have brought roses for my girlfriend.""Speaker 2: Well, It costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person. What a costly sport! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it. And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute.""Speaker 1: Haha, Jogging? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring?""Speaker 2: Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile?""Speaker 1: I have both, But I usually use my car to get to school.""Speaker 2: Great, The price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash, Check, Or credit card?""Speaker 1: I'll pay cash.""Speaker 2: Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?""Speaker 1: No, Thank you.""Speaker 2: Don't be silly.""Speaker 1: I'm serious.""Speaker 2: All right. Next time you will treat.""Speaker 2: I love flowers you know. Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: They're probably up front. The preacher's about to speak. Let's listen.""Speaker 1: That was such a touching speech. He must have really known Taylor well.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. I'll have to sink about it.""Speaker 1: Sink?""Speaker 2: Oops. I meant, \"think\".""Speaker 1: Mary, You're going to have to work on your pronunciation.""Speaker 2: I know.""Speaker 2: This one?""Speaker 1: That's my index finger!""Speaker 2: Oh, Right. This one, Right?""Speaker 1: Umm... That's the thumb, Nick.""Speaker 2: Okay, Okay, I got it! This is the ring finger!""Speaker 2: Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road?""Speaker 1: That's the one.""Speaker 2: His house must be worth millions! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford. The surrounding area is really peaceful, And getting into the city centre from there is very convenient. How can he afford that place?""Speaker 1: He didn't buy it. His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money.""Speaker 2: I didn't mean to hurt anyone.""Speaker 2: Yes, Here you go. I don't need a visa to go to Spain, Do I?""Speaker 1: Fortunately for you, You don't. Next time, If you have any questions about visas, You should try to find out before you get to the airport.""Speaker 2: That's good advice.""Speaker 1: Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat?""Speaker 2: Are there any seats available by the emergency exits?""Speaker 1: Let me see here... Yes, There's one left.""Speaker 2: I think you just need to get more sleep.""Speaker 2: I can't afford to.""Speaker 1: All right. Now that everybody's here. Shall we be getting started? Miss Lin, Are you ready?""Speaker 2: Yes, Thanks. Before I start, I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials.""Speaker 1: Excuse me, Miss Lin. Would you mind speaking up, Please? I can't hear you very well.""Speaker 2: 12 hours, Including 5 hours overtime.""Speaker 1: That's tough indeed! Do you think your health can afford?""Speaker 2: I don't care. I need money.""Speaker 1: Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime, But do you think it's really worth?""Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yes. Money comes faster in that way than otherwise.""Speaker 2: More and more people like it now. Fewer people play table tennis than before. Many people like swimming, Because it is fun and keeps you fit.""Speaker 1: In my country, Many people enjoy golf, But it is too expensive for some people. A few people like extreme sports, But I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them.""Speaker 2: Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people. Several people from my university enjoy them, But most of us just watch. No one I know plays golf.""Speaker 2: Oh, Jared! I can't wait for our wedding! I hope you don't mind, But I'Ve already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I'Ve had plenty of time to start planning!""Speaker 1: She what?""Speaker 2: I'm taking two weeks now.

I'll be staying with friends.""Speaker 1: You're lucky. It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August.""Speaker 2: I'd like to go to Tianjin.""Speaker 1: Do you want to go to the beach there?""Speaker 2: Yes, Of course. And what's your plan?""Speaker 1: The same to you.""Speaker 2: That's great. I thought you said you didn't get the job.""Speaker 1: I thought I did bad on the interview, But I guess I was wrong. I'm so happy right now.""Speaker 2: I bet. That's great news. I'm very happy for you.""Speaker 1: Thanks. I feel like celebrating. Let's go have a beer. It's on me.""Speaker 2: Yes, Of course. I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning.""Speaker 1: Me too, But I think we shouldn't drink too much of it, As it's not very healthy.""Speaker 2: I totally disagree. The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink. Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 'including diabetes, Heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver.""Speaker 1: But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content, Serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system, As well as other organs, And leads to addiction.""Speaker 2: It's 60 yuan, Please.""Speaker 1: Sorry, We have student cards. We can get discounts with these, Can't we?""Speaker 2: Sure. That'll be 40 yuan, Please.""Speaker 2: Sorry, Dave, I didn't mean you. I am just not in the mood for this. I have work to do.""Speaker 2: Do they live with you and your parents?""Speaker 1: Yeah, But it's expensive. Nah, I'm going to YY's.""Speaker 2: On second thought, I think I'll join you.""Speaker 1: They'Ve just renovated the place. You may be surprised.""Speaker 2: Wow, They really went to town on this place!""Speaker 1: Quite a difference, Huh?""Speaker 2: It's a girl.""Speaker 1: Can I hold it for a moment?""Speaker 2: Sure. She is a peaceful child.""Speaker 1: Oh, How adorable! She's got your eyes.""Speaker 2: So they say.""Speaker 1: When are you returning home?""Speaker 2: Well. The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth.""Speaker 2: Well, Why don't you have some fruit instead?""Speaker 2: I tried before. There are no buttons on the air conditioning.""Speaker 1: There must be buttons. How do they turn it on and off?""Speaker 2: I think it is centrally controlled. They control it at the main desk.""Speaker 1: Well, They have it too cold in here. I want to be warmer. I won't be able to sleep.""Speaker 2: I'm going downstairs for more drinking water. I will ask them.""Speaker 1: What did they say about the air conditioning?""Speaker 2: That's true. I really should go home and prepare for the next test, But I'm feeling tired.""Speaker 1: Let's go and get a coffee together. That will help you to wake up again!""Speaker 2: Ok. I feel like sitting down and having a chat. How have you been recently?""Speaker 1: Oh, You know me. I'm always happy! If I think I'm getting into a bad mood, I call some friends and socialize or have a chat.""Speaker 2: You're right. He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him.""Speaker 2: I know, But I keep thinking of him every day. And I get really depressed when he's not online.""Speaker 1: I think it's just a crush. You can't be serious.""Speaker 2: Well, This might be silly. But I just can't get him off my mind. And I can't help missing him.""Speaker 1: Did you tell him?""Speaker 2: Well, I am from Canada. Actually.""Speaker 1: Oh, I am so sorry.""Speaker 2: Oh, I won't be back so early. The film will be over at nine. Can I have the key to the bicycle?""Speaker 1: No. I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night.""Speaker 2: Oh, Dad, I'm not a child. I'm 17 already. I'll come back as soon as the film is over.""Speaker 1: Ok. Here's the key. Take care.""Speaker 2: Of course. How're you?""Speaker 1: Great. Uh, Justin, Would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night? He's at the Kangaroo Club.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Karen, But I can't. I have to work late this Thursday.""Speaker 1: Oh... That's too bad.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I really like Lesley.""Speaker 1: Actually, Are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday? He's playing those two nights as well.""Speaker 2: Well, I can't make it on Friday either, But I'm free on Saturday night. What time does it start?""Speaker 2: Ok, Here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture?""Speaker 1: I know that, It's The English Patient. It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s.""Speaker 2: Sounds great.""Speaker 1: The coffee, Books, Music and sunshine are just beautiful there.""Speaker 2: How nice.""Speaker 1: I may take you there some day.""Speaker 2: Could I get back the sweater you borrowed?""Speaker 1: Sure. Oh, That reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?""Speaker 2: I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one.""Speaker 1: I basically believe in science over theology. I mean, I believe in evolution for example. However, There are many things that science hasn't explained yet.""Speaker 2: I'm sure that science will explain everything eventually. I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.""Speaker 1: For example?""Speaker 2: Well, I hope it's comfortable enough for you.""Speaker 1: I think I'm going to like it here.""Speaker 2: You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use.""Speaker 1: Wow, I have my own bathroom!""Speaker 2: Kind of. It leads to my bedroom.""Speaker 2: Fine. It will be at my house. Do you know how to get there?""Speaker 1: I kind of know where you live, But could you e-mail me your address?""Speaker 2: I can do that. Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party?""Speaker 1: I would really like to bring my friend Jake, If that would be OK.""Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I remember Jake. That would be fine.""Speaker 2: Easy stuff. But thanks. And the admiration is mutual.""Speaker 1: It is?""Speaker 2: You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business. And we don't even have a working demo yet.""Speaker 2: I'm afraid I have some business to attend to.""Speaker 1: Then would you like to have lunch with us?""Speaker 2: I'd love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now.""Speaker 1: Would you like me to give you a lift?""Speaker 2: No, Thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there.""Speaker 1: Come on. It's no trouble at all.""Speaker 2: It is, But I can put you on a waiting list, If you would like.""Speaker 1: Please. And in the mean time, Can I look at apartments available in the area from this office?""Speaker 2: Yes, Here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As.""Speaker 1: Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them?""Speaker 2: Please come in.""Speaker 1: Here is a little gift for your family. It's a calendar with all the community events on it. I hope it can be helpful.""Speaker 2: I really appreciate it.""Speaker 1: Since we are neighbors, If you need any help or anything, Please come to me.""Speaker 2: I will. Actually, I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before.""Speaker 1: Oh, Don't worry about that here. There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood. You know, They are all very strong.""Speaker 2: What note? I can't see. I just pulled an all-nighter.""Speaker 1: It's a little green post-it note, Stuck right in the middle of my computer screen.""Speaker 2: And? What does it say? Isn't there a name?""Speaker 2: Relax. I can hold my own. Now, Point your skis toward the bottom of the hill. Easy does it!""Speaker 1: I don't think I can get up enough nerve to do this.""Speaker 2: Sure I like shopping. Who is organizing the party?""Speaker 1: One of the girls in my office.""Speaker 2: What's the occasion?""Speaker 1: There is no specie occasion. She just likes to organize parties from time to time. This time it is a country theme.""Speaker 2: That's easy, How about a cowgirl? Oh I know even better, A Canadian Mountie.""Speaker 1: Well where am I going to get that sort of costume?""Speaker 2: I was. It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to home because I can't afford the airfare. I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, Like my mom's cooking and being around my family.""Speaker 1: Yeah, It can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, But then I started going out, Keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.""Speaker 2: Okay, Susan. It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year. Is this information correct?""Speaker 1: Yes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.""Speaker 2: Sure. That's not a problem. Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester?""Speaker 1: Yeah. Here's my list. I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.""Speaker 2: We'd better get back to work.""Speaker 2: I don't know. I hope it's nothing serious.""Speaker 1: Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital.""Speaker 2: Oh? What happened?""Speaker 1: His sister had a car accident last week.""Speaker 2: Is she fine now?""Speaker 1: She is still in a coma.""Speaker 2: A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units, Including general and specific requirements, For his or her undergraduate major and elective courses.""Speaker 1: How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree?""Speaker 2: In some way, She is more modern.""Speaker 1: If I do try to do anything, I'd only be sent off with a flea in my ear.""Speaker 2: Oh yeah. It loses only a few seconds in the whole month.""Speaker 2: Yes, We must. What have you been doing since I last saw you?""Speaker 1: I've been studying hard for my examinations. And you?""Speaker 2: I've been learning Japanese every evening.""Speaker 1: Why have you been learning Japanese? Why not English?""Speaker 2: I hope to visit Japan next year.""Speaker 1: Well, We'll both have to start learning all the new dances.""Speaker 2: Yes, Let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons.""Speaker 2: Speaking of that trip, Alan bought a shirt at a department store, But the sleeves are too long. Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them?""Speaker 1: I know several. But wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size?""Speaker 2: Isn't that complicated?""Speaker 2: He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair.""Speaker 1: Oh, How long?""Speaker 2: Down to his shoulders. It's beautiful, Like gold.""Speaker 1: Ok. Ok. You'd better tell me what he does.""Speaker 2: He's a very creative painter. His paintings sell well.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: He's quite a patient teacher, Too.""Speaker 1: Fine.""Speaker 2: What are you talking about?

I know!""Speaker 2: Did you hurry back to the bedroom?""Speaker 1: Yes. I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting \"April Fool, April Fool\".""Speaker 2: Oh, Your classmates took you in.""Speaker 2: They're pretty similar, But in different ways. I really can't decide. How about you?""Speaker 1: For me, I think starting school was more exciting.""Speaker 2: Does that mean work isn't that great?""Speaker 1: It's different for everyone, But because I knew school was going to be so much fun, I really got excited about it.""Speaker 2: But work is a huge portion of our lives. I'm looking forward to making it fun.""Speaker 2: Oh, Really? So, Spain is through to the next round?""Speaker 2: Yes, Especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan. The only problem is, They may have trouble when they go to open up business here.""Speaker 1: Why would you say that?""Speaker 2: They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan. There are a lot of cultural differences to account for.""Speaker 1: I'll say! Sometimes they just do things really differently. But one thing I can say, They are really hospitable.""Speaker 2: It sure is cold this morning, Isn't it? I barely even get out of bed!""Speaker 1: Yeah. It's pretty cold, Alright.""Speaker 2: Did you catch the news this morning? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street.""Speaker 1: No, I didn't hear about that.""Speaker 2: Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called \"Chinese-Style Divorce\".""Speaker 1: Oh. Really? I saw it two years ago. It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I found it is so close to our life.""Speaker 1: It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world.""Speaker 2: You said it. You know, The divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year.""Speaker 1: Well, It's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too.""Speaker 2: I don't have to worry about rent. I live right here.""Speaker 1: What? In your cubicle?""Speaker 2: We are short of staff today.""Speaker 1: There is something wrong with this dish.""Speaker 2: What's wrong?""Speaker 1: I don't think this is fresh.""Speaker 2: They were delivered this morning.""Speaker 2: I hear we'll have a new English teacher this semester.""Speaker 1: Really? I hope we will do much better under her guidance.""Speaker 2: Why do you think that this would be a good move?""Speaker 1: I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me.""Speaker 2: Yes, There are always pros and cons to making a career change.""Speaker 1: Also, The matter of pay is also a consideration.""Speaker 2: I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it. The benefits are much better.""Speaker 2: Not really. Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre, Especially in the main shopping areas. The public transport system is pretty good.""Speaker 1: What about restaurants and entertainment?""Speaker 2: There are restaurants with food from all over the world. We have a small china-town near the city centre. There are many Indian, Thai, And Italian restaurants all over the city centre. There are many sports events in my city. We have several sports venues for football, Rugby, And cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey.""Speaker 1: Is there a lot of nightlife in your city?""Speaker 2: People cook turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner.""Speaker 1: Anything else?""Speaker 2: Besides the turkeys, We'll also have other delicious food. Such as pumpkin pies, Puddings, Mashed potatoes, Bread, A lot of fresh fruits and vegetables.""Speaker 2: Hi, I'm Susan Marshall. You can call me Susan. Nice to meet you.""Speaker 1: What do you do, Susan?""Speaker 2: Well, I'm a college student. How about you?""Speaker 1: I work for the Bank of China, In the International Section.""Speaker 2: Easy? Ha!! It was easy for them to cheat you!!""Speaker 2: Again? You just went last week! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home! Honestly, Why do you need a manicure every week?""Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I like to pamper myself, And my nails look great. You should come with me!""Speaker 2: Why? I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that!""Speaker 1: They don't only paint my nails! The manicurist will remove my cuticles, File my nails, And apply at least nails coats of nail polish!""Speaker 2: I've heard about it, But I don't really know about it.""Speaker 1: The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school. It gives you discounts on all kinds of things. Movies, Pizza, Clothing, School supplies.""Speaker 2: What about beer?""Speaker 1: The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer. But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges. So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club, You get a discount on the entrance fee.""Speaker 2: That's pretty cool. How much of a discount?""Speaker 2: That's kind of boring. Don't you want to tell them anything else?""Speaker 1: Well, Maybe you could tell them about my promotion.""Speaker 2: You've been promoted? When did that happen?""Speaker 1: Just today. I guess I forgot to mention it.""Speaker 2: Congratulations! That's really exciting! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate!""Speaker 1: Shouldn't we finish writing this letter first?""Speaker 2: I dropped it, And the cover tore off.""Speaker 1: I'm going to have to charge you for the damage.""Speaker 2: How much?""Speaker 1: It's only $ 5.""Speaker 2: That's not too bad.""Speaker 1: I know it's not.""Speaker 2: Here's the money for the book.""Speaker 1: Thank you for your payment.""Speaker 2: You knowMiao Li-my roommate, He bought a computer last month. He has turned his computer into an electronic playground. He plays football, Rides horses, Drives racing cars, And does a whole bunch of other games. Every night he keeps me up.""Speaker 1: Don't you like games.""Speaker 2: I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends.""Speaker 1: Me too. Recently, I've made many friends on the net. Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them.""Speaker 2: What are the temperatures in winter? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees.""Speaker 1: In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that. The streets are often icing in the morning. With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms.""Speaker 2: Yeah, We do. In the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon. I heard your city has a lot of fog, Is that true?""Speaker 2: What do you think now?""Speaker 1: There are lots of jobs, And almost everybody works. There is a high standard of living. People earn a lot, But they spend a lot to live. So there isn't so much money after all.""Speaker 2: But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do.""Speaker 2: Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities. If it's needed, They would live with their parents.""Speaker 1: When I'm old, I'll also be like that.""Speaker 2: You need a child first, And that's your duty, Too.""Speaker 2: Well, There is one thing.""Speaker 1: What is the matter?""Speaker 2: I am a little worried about my host family. You know, In the agreement, I have to do some cooking for them.""Speaker 1: Yes?""Speaker 2: Well, I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking.""Speaker 1: Oh, Listen, You'll soon learn, And I am sure they will explain to you how they like to get prepared.""Speaker 2: Why do you think so?""Speaker 1: Well, One of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects. State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes, So audiences have high expectations for this one, And I don't think they will be disappointed.""Speaker 2: You are right. The special effects were amazing. And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes, Weapons and creatures.""Speaker 2: Confusing. But not, Because it's nothing.""Speaker 1: Where'd you meet him?""Speaker 2: Oh, Listen, I can't even remember. Ok, On my birthday, I wandered into over 30 rooms, For a joke, Sort of and he was there, And we started chatting...""Speaker 1: About what?""Speaker 2: It's July 7th. Chinese Valentine's Day!""Speaker 1: Oh, God. I just forget it.""Speaker 2: I thought you had trouble with Clive!""Speaker 1: No. But now he will be in bigger trouble! What's a boyfriend for? Forget about Valentine's Day?""Speaker 2: Poor guy! It's not fair. You forgot it too.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's Clive.""Speaker 2: Wow! Good timing.""Speaker 1: Excuse me for a while. Clive asked me out to a movie! Do you want to join us?""Speaker 2: Come on. Two is company.""Speaker 2: Is there anything else?""Speaker 1: He has a mustache, If I remember correctly, And a light complexion.""Speaker 2: How old is he?""Speaker 1: He is in his late thirties.""Speaker 2: Well. I shouldn't have any trouble recognizing him. What time does his flight arrive?""Speaker 2: I really wish I hadn't done it.""Speaker 1: What on earth are you talking about?""Speaker 2: I got caught cheating. I feel so ashamed. The teacher saw me and told me I failed.""Speaker 1: What were you thinking?""Speaker 2: You know my father. If I fail, He'll kill me. I have to do well.""Speaker 1: But what you should do is study hard.""Speaker 2: I know... I know... It's all my fault. I feel awful that I didn't study, And I cheated, And I got caught.""Speaker 2: Oh, Nothing much really. And how is everything with you?""Speaker 1: Fine, Thanks. I've been busy lately.""Speaker 2: What have you been doing?""Speaker 1: I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month.""Speaker 2: Really? Good luck for them.""Speaker 1: Thanks. And how are your parents?""Speaker 2: They're both very well, Thanks.""Speaker 2: I'm Helen Baker.""Speaker 1: Glad to meet you, Ms. Baker.""Speaker 2: Glad to meet you, Too.""Speaker 1: Where are you from, Ms. Baker?""Speaker 2: I'm from New Zealand.""Speaker 1: What do you do for a living?""Speaker 2: I'm a teacher.""Speaker 2: What's the matter? Didn't you sleep well last night?""Speaker 1: I was too excited to sleep last night. I didn't go to sleep until quite late.""Speaker 2: Then when did you go to sleep?""Speaker 1: About 2 o 'clock in the morning.""Speaker 2: When?""Speaker 1: About 2 o 'clock.""Speaker 2: Oh, Susie. Didn't I tell you over and over again that you wouldn't be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep?""Speaker 1: You did, But I can't help it.""Speaker 2: Yeah, The smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red.""Speaker 1: I never knew that.""Speaker 2: Yeah, More people need to take public transportation or carpool.""Speaker 1: Well, We'Ve already done our part.""Speaker 2: Yeah, It's your turn to drive next week. Don't be late picking me up.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. I'm getting more sleep these days. The baby's finally growing up a little more.""Speaker 2: I don't say that. But it seems to me the housewife should do that.""Speaker 1: I'm your wife, Not a housewife. I have my own work.""Speaker 2: Oh, What a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own.""Speaker 1: In fact, They're both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, Since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.""Speaker 2: Oh, Right. Now I know why they would want to see our boy. It's hard to imagine the wonder! Are they expecting a boy or a girl?""Speaker 2: Are you ready to go?""Speaker 1: I'm clear so far.""Speaker 2: The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in.""Speaker 1: It won't go in!""Speaker 2: Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work.""Speaker 1: Yes, Next step.""Speaker 2: Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that reliable.""Speaker 1: They're totally unreliable.""Speaker 2: What would you like today?""Speaker 1: I'll have the leg of lamb.""Speaker 2: I checked.""Speaker 1: Was it on the shelf?""Speaker 2: It should have been, But it wasn't.""Speaker 1: Maybe someone took it.""Speaker 2: Will you be getting another copy anytime soon?""Speaker 1: I'm sure we will.""Speaker 2: Would you be able to reserve it for me?""Speaker 1: I sure will.""Speaker 2: Well, There are a lot of things, Like reading news, Email, Shopping, Etc. But mostly I chat online. You could say I'm addicted to online chatting.""Speaker 1: I never chatted online before. What's it like.""Speaker 2: Well, Basically it's similar to face-to-face chat, But you type instead of talk. You should try it at least once.""Speaker 1: Really? Who do you chat with?""Speaker 2: Everyone wants to earn a lot of money. Don't you think so? What's more, I am interested in money management.""Speaker 1: No, You are wrong. Money can't buy happiness and health. I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money. In other words, I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. But a proverb says \"Money makes themare go.\" I think it will be better if you have more money.""Speaker 2: Take it easy. There is still one more week left before the exam begins. Have you prepared for it well?""Speaker 1: No, I haven't began my preparations.""Speaker 2: Then shall we make preparations together?""Speaker 1: Great. You can help me a lot with English.""Speaker 2: All right. But I am very poor at math. Would you like to help me with my math?""Speaker 2: How about going to italy next summer vacation?""Speaker 2: I'll beat him.""Speaker 2: I really appreciated it.""Speaker 1: I was happy to help.""Speaker 2: It was so kind of you.""Speaker 1: Don't mention it.""Speaker 2: What's the hurry?""Speaker 1: I must catch the nine-thirty train.""Speaker 2: I think I'm quite fit for a driver.""Speaker 1: But it's very tired.""Speaker 2: I don't care.""Speaker 1: What's your parents 'opinion?""Speaker 2: Are you also going to Beijing?""Speaker 1: Yes, On a business trip. How about you?""Speaker 2: I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there. Have you ever been there before?""Speaker 1: Yes, I went there once last summer.""Speaker 2: Really? What did you think?""Speaker 1: I think it is amazing. You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway.""Speaker 2: Was it that crowded?""Speaker 2: How often do you meet?""Speaker 1: We plan to get together once a week.""Speaker 2: What days, Do you know?""Speaker 1: We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library, From seven to eight.""Speaker 2: But I don't know how to play basketball.""Speaker 2: I really appreciated it.""Speaker 1: I was happy to help.""Speaker 2: It was so kind of you.""Speaker 1: Don't mention it.""Speaker 2: It will be held at the Central Music Hall.""Speaker 1: What is on the program?""Speaker 2: It's a piano solo. I'm fond of piano, You know.""Speaker 1: Hah! Ok. Let's go together!""Speaker 2: Let's meet at the park at 6:00.""Speaker 2: Laura.""Speaker 1: Do you like this place?""Speaker 2: I don't think it's very nice. And my father doesn't like it. But my mother likes it very much. So we often come here.""Speaker 1: How often?""Speaker 2: Well, We come here almost every month.""Speaker 1: Who's that?""Speaker 2: It's my mother. She's fond of swimming. And the man beside her is my father.""Speaker 1: Do you like swimming?""Speaker 2: Well. We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia.""Speaker 1: Wow, Isn't that dangerous?""Speaker 2: A little, But the rush was worth it.""Speaker 1: Tell me about it.""Speaker 2: We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us.""Speaker 1: 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.""Speaker 2: That sounds like a good idea. The sky is clear, The sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze, So it is not too hot.""Speaker 1: I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit, This sure is a nice spring day.""Speaker 2: Hey, This spot in the shade looks really comfortable.""Speaker 1: Okay. Hey, Is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?""Speaker 2: I don't think much of the film.""Speaker 1: I think it is the worst one I have ever seen.""Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure I agree with you. It was not a good one, But it was not the worst one. Actually, It wasn't too bad.""Speaker 1: I can't think the same.""Speaker 2: What's more, Some scenes were good, Much fit for the children.""Speaker 2: Why is that?""Speaker 1: I was sick.""Speaker 2: Oh, Okay. Well, Here you go.""Speaker 1: Are these all of them?""Speaker 2: Oh, Wait, Here are the rest.""Speaker 1: Thanks a bunch.""Speaker 2: Let's just go over all of it to double-check.""Speaker 1: Sure, Let's do it.""Speaker 2: Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right?""Speaker 1: I don't see any mistakes.""Speaker 2: Ok, Now that we've gotten those straightened out, Let's total the score.""Speaker 2: I don't need to drink every weekend. I could be happy just staying home, You know.""Speaker 1: Okay. Stay home Sunday. But Friday we should go out dancing.""Speaker 2: Do you feel like dancing?""Speaker 1: Yes? Why not?""Speaker 2: Alright. At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends.""Speaker 1: They aren't alcoholic!""Speaker 2: No, Maybe they're not. But they're close.""Speaker 2: Let me think. Oh, Awful! I still have not finished the chart which was assigned by Mr. Wharton on Friday. So that task will make my busy.""Speaker 1: I am better. I will go out to have a visit to my aunt. Why don't we have fun on weekend?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes, It is.""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom...""Speaker 1: They don't have toilets at the campground?""Speaker 2: Mmm.""Speaker 1: Well, I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E. Rd. ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 2: I'Ve got a fever and really a bad headache.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Why don't you take some aspirin?""Speaker 2: I'Ve already tried some but it didn't help.""Speaker 1: Well, It's necessary for you to see a doctor.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I should.""Speaker 1: Well, You'd better get some rest.""Speaker 2: Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes. Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy?""Speaker 2: What is in it?""Speaker 1: It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks, But it is spacious and bright.""Speaker 2: Do you get along with your roommates?""Speaker 1: Of course. They are very friendly.""Speaker 2: Which floor are you on?""Speaker 1: We are on the 5th floor, And there's a very nice view from the balcony.""Speaker 2: Oh, You can climb the stairs as a workout.""Speaker 1: Yes, That's a good idea.""Speaker 2: To where exactly?""Speaker 1: New England.""Speaker 2: I know. But I'm not ready for married life yet.""Speaker 1: Julia, I really love you. I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future.""Speaker 2: Your way does touch my heart.""Speaker 1: So, Will you marry me?""Speaker 2: Yeah, Are you surprised?""Speaker 2: I'm not kidding. Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time.""Speaker 1: So do we have to stay in this English class forever?""Speaker 2: No. You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation. Then you go on practicing and learning outside. A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation.""Speaker 1: So it's really the same story. Practice, Practice, Practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language.""Speaker 2: But everything has been so easy.""Speaker 1: Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned! That may be true, But if you were to do it, You would have trouble on the horizon. You always say that.""Speaker 2: Yeah, You never look at the positive side of things.""Speaker 2: Nice to meet you, Karren. I'm Tim Wang.""Speaker 2: If I were you, I would change the beginning. You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities.""Speaker 1: Good idea, Betty. What would you think about the second part?""Speaker 2: I think it's too short. You'd better say something about your work experience.""Speaker 1: You're right, I'll change it. How about the last part?""Speaker 2: Which tests do you mean?""Speaker 1: You know. Tests like how jealous are you? And are you a fashion victim?""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. I like to do those tests, Too, But I don't take them seriously.""Speaker 2: To be honest, I don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch!""Speaker 2: How about going to dance? There is a very good nightclub nearby.""Speaker 1: That's a great idea. Let's go... Oh, The dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful.""Speaker 2: I'm glad you like it. The band is called \"Four and One\". They are especially good at playing rock and roll.""Speaker 1: That's great! I love to dance to fast music.""Speaker 2: Then you must be interested in disco dancing, Aren't you?""Speaker 1: Yes, Disco dancing is my favorite. It's great fun and good exercise as well.""Speaker 2: I'm OK. I'll be fine. I'v cool. I'm cold. I'm like ice. She won't know what hit her.""Speaker 2: I don't have a library card.""Speaker 1: Why don't you apply for one right now?""Speaker 2: Sure. That would be great.""Speaker 1: Please fill out this application.""Speaker 2: Okay. Here you go.""Speaker 1: Now, Sign your name on the back of the card.""Speaker 2: Here you go.""Speaker 1: Here's your library card.""Speaker 2: Don't judge a book by its cover. Do you Kwon what it's about?""Speaker 1: No, Not at all.""Speaker 2: First of all, It's a romance novel, Set in the early 19th century.""Speaker 1: I didn't realize it was a romance novel. What's the main storyline?""Speaker 2: It's basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls.""Speaker 1: Why does he want to do that?""Speaker 2: I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.""Speaker 1: What about the expression \"goodbye\"? Is that an idiom?""Speaker 2: That is just a natural, Grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.""Speaker 2: Come on over. This is your desk, And this is your time card. Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work.""Speaker 1: I will.""Speaker 2: One more thing, Keep your desk neat. It's the rule. There is no exception, Even the art designers have to keep their desks neat.""Speaker 1: I'll keep that in mind. Does everything on the desk belong to me?""Speaker 2: Not belong. You can use them as long as you work here. When you quit, You'll have to return them to the company.""Speaker 2: I think the Romans do what everyone else does.""Speaker 1: Certainly.""Speaker 2: And Roman really loves life. He knows how to enjoy himself.""Speaker 1: Not always. But they like good meal.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: How can I go there to have a taste?""Speaker 2: Okay, Let me think. What about a party-and-movie night? We can rearrange our reference room, Invite a band to play some music, Order in some food and watch a movie later.""Speaker 1: Sounds like a good idea, But a band sounds too expensive.""Speaker 2: What's the difference?""Speaker 1: We haven't come here in business but for pleasure. We should go out exciting. What can you see in the subway? Nothing!""Speaker 2: What can you see from a tram or a double-decker?""Speaker 1: I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk. I can see cars driving on the streets. I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind. I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air.""Speaker 2: You know what we will get?""Speaker 1: We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily. And if you come back to office, You just reconnect your laptop with docking station.""Speaker 2: What docking station?""Speaker 1: This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk. The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments, Like fax, Copier, A screen, Printer and scanner, And it will be very convenient.""Speaker 2: Come on. Don't hesitate.""Speaker 2: Well, Let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?""Speaker 1: I think I am doing great, Except for that one test!""Speaker 2: Well, Your scores show that you could do a little better. What do you think you could improve on?""Speaker 1: I think that I could study a little harder for tests.""Speaker 2: Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin.""Speaker 1: Yes, I know.""Speaker 2: That's great news! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday.""Speaker 1: I feel much better, But I'm still worried about something.""Speaker 2: What's that?""Speaker 1: Well, I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning, And I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic.""Speaker 2: That's annoying, But nothing to worry about.""Speaker 2: Ok.""Speaker 1: Ok, An Englishman, A Scotsman, And an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert, And they could only take one thing with them.""Speaker 2: I see.""Speaker 1: So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment.""Speaker 2: Oh, That's funny!""Speaker 1: Hang on, I haven't finished yet.""Speaker 2: Oh, Sorry.""Speaker 1: Well, As I was saying, They showed each other what they had decided to bring. The Englishman had brought some water. \"If we get thirsty, We'll have something to drink,\" he said. The Scotsman brought a map. \"If we get lost, We'll be able to find our way.\" The Irishman had brought a car door.""Speaker 2: A car door? You mean just one car door?""Speaker 2: Well, What do you like doing?""Speaker 1: Traveling, Swimming, Going to the cinema. And you?""Speaker 2: I like painting, Sailing, Watching football and talking to you.""Speaker 1: I like talking to you too.""Speaker 2: Do you want to go to an Exhibition? There's one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow.""Speaker 2: And now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart.""Speaker 1: Oh, So he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, Then?""Speaker 2: Right now he speaks mostly Chinese, And he can say a few English words. But he will learn.""Speaker 2: Yes, According to the agenda, There will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course.""Speaker 1: Well, Good for you. I hope you can get what you want from the training.""Speaker 2: Well, I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks. Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it? It tastes great and very healthy too.""Speaker 1: Oh, I haven't noticed that before. Maybe I will try next time.""Speaker 2: Why don't you go ahead of me? I have more items than you.""Speaker 1: Thank you. In fact, I am in a hurry. My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot.""Speaker 2: You're welcome. It was good seeing you again.""Speaker 2: We import a little oil from Venezuela, But we are fairly self-sufficient. We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries.""Speaker 1: I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone.""Speaker 2: Yes, That's right. So far, Only small deposits have been found. Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil. The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country.""Speaker 2: What kind of food do they serve?""Speaker 1: It's Asian fusion. I heard it's delicious.""Speaker 2: I found it very disappointing.""Speaker 1: She liked the acting, Too, Because that's what she wanted to see.""Speaker 2: I wasn't happy with it.""Speaker 2: Well, You always say you're busy.""Speaker 1: That's right.""Speaker 2: And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself.""Speaker 1: I... I... I miss my parents, Also they miss me.""Speaker 2: Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, And you didn't say anything about it.""Speaker 1: You mean I am groaned a few words?""Speaker 2: You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself.""Speaker 2: Have you heard of Hot Fuzz?""Speaker 1: Yes. Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead?""Speaker 2: That's the one. It's an actioncomedy. What do you think?""Speaker 1: To be honest, I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead. Besides, I like movies with a happy ending best.""Speaker 2: What do you have in mind?""Speaker 2: Me, Too. What would you like to do?""Speaker 1: Well, We could go to a movie. Have you see Shrek 2?""Speaker 2: I have, Actually. How about the movie, Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood?""Speaker 1: Hmm... I'Ve seen that, Too. We could go for a walk in the park.""Speaker 2: We could, But it looks like it's going to rain soon.""Speaker 1: I guess that's out. Why don't we go shopping?""Speaker 2: No, She's average.""Speaker 1: What color are her eyes?""Speaker 2: They're dark gray.""Speaker 1: What color is her hair?""Speaker 2: It's blond.""Speaker 1: And how old is she?""Speaker 2: Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced.""Speaker 1: I can understand. By the way, Is there anyway I can help?""Speaker 2: No, Not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's so great, Bless you! If you need me, I'll always be there.""Speaker 2: She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship.""Speaker 1: Really? That's the icing on the cake. Congratulation again!""Speaker 2: By air, Of course. It takes over two weeks to go by sea.""Speaker 1: I once went to Singapore by air. It was very exciting-but never again.""Speaker 2: Why? Did you feel frightened?""Speaker 1: For a short time. One of the engines caught fire.""Speaker 2: What did the pilot do?""Speaker 1: He put it out and flew back to the airport. Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was.""Speaker 2: Why do you say that?""Speaker 1: Why? Are you kidding me? A guy like that is hard to find. Few boys are so caring, So patient, And did I mention he is hottie?""Speaker 2: You really think so?""Speaker 1: Totally. I am saying it from the bottom of my heart! And it's obvious that he's head over heels in love with you, Too.""Speaker 2: Probably. The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek. One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company.""Speaker 2: I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day. But how about my paper?""Speaker 1: Just take it easy. Come on with me.""Speaker 2: Yes, But not the Ritz Carlton, The \"Ritz\" is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor.""Speaker 1: In that case, Let me make a quick change into my street clothes.""Speaker 2: I'll wait right here for you Superman.""Speaker 1: Ta da! Let's go to the Ritz!""Speaker 2: Jacob Hammer. He is originally from Holland.""Speaker 1: That's my uncle. You're my cousin! Hi cousin!""Speaker 2: It's really a small world, Isn't it! The Hammer family isn't very big.""Speaker 1: It really is. Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up?""Speaker 2: But where's the switch?""Speaker 2: Women have often played an important role in british history. Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588. More recently, Margaret thatcher transformed british.""Speaker 2: She is only after his money.""Speaker 1: If I were her, I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love.""Speaker 2: You must be joking. Those two.""Speaker 1: Well, My dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth.Davi called me this morning.""Speaker 2: So when did this happen?""Speaker 1: Last weekend, While they were on the Sik trip.""Speaker 2: Well, I believe it now, And when are they are getting marry?""Speaker 1: Next june.""Speaker 2: The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich. It also leads to more unemployment in the long run. I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again...""Speaker 2: That's serious.""Speaker 1: I know. The economy here is having serious problems. But because the government declared a default, The currency value went way down.""Speaker 2: So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much.""Speaker 2: Son, Firecrackers aren't toys. They're dangerous!""Speaker 1: No, Fireworks are awesome!""Speaker 2: Thanks!""Speaker 1: Have you forgotten the cheers?""Speaker 2: No, I haven't. I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly.""Speaker 2: That's incredible. I cann't believe it.""Speaker 1: You have to. It's sure.""Speaker 2: My exam.""Speaker 1: Oh, Is that all?""Speaker 2: I feel very nervous about it.""Speaker 2: What would you do with all the animals? You couldn't just let them go. Besides, Some people would still hunt them. Meat has become an integral part of our diet.""Speaker 1: We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible.""Speaker 2: That's true. I think zoo are a good idea, Because they allow people to get close to animals. I think it's good for kids to see wild animals.""Speaker 2: My field is electronic engineering. Which country do you think I should go?""Speaker 1: Were I in your position, I'd go to America.""Speaker 2: Which university should I apply to?""Speaker 1: There are many universities for you to choose from. Some famous universities such as Harvard, Yale, The University of Michigan, And Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study, But they are very competitive and expensive. Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper.""Speaker 2: Yeah, We're buddy-buddy still.""Speaker 1: He seems sincere, And trustworthy.""Speaker 2: Well, He is, But he can be conniving at times.""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: Well, I know that he would never stab me in the back. But I've seen him double cross other people.""Speaker 1: Oh, My! Really? I never thought he would be like that.""Speaker 2: Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's like that all the time.""Speaker 2: I'd like to, Where?""Speaker 1: At our club.""Speaker 2: When?""Speaker 1: At 7:30 p.M.""Speaker 2: I'll go in time, Thank you.""Speaker 2: Thanks.""Speaker 1: Here you are. You must return them within a month.""Speaker 2: What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month?""Speaker 1: You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them.""Speaker 2: Ok. Thank you very much for your trouble.""Speaker 2: My boss gave me a big project. I had to have it finished by this morning. It was so difficult.""Speaker 1: You shouldn't work so hard.""Speaker 2: I know, But hard work pays off. You know.""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: The best island of Korea-Jizhou island.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: Attractive scenery, Pleasant climate, These make it charming.""Speaker 1: Yes, I think so. But there is also something terrible.""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: Sometimes the traffic is too busy.""Speaker 2: There were six of us.""Speaker 1: Did you get caught in the bad storm?""Speaker 2: Sounds great! How many kinds of folk collections do they have?""Speaker 1: Well. There're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city. That's half the collections of antique objects in China. There's one exhibition half for multiple collection, And several individual display rooms for private collectors.""Speaker 2: Private collectors! They must have excellent collections. I'II go and see each of them. What kinds of collections can I see? Come on, Don't keep me in suspense!""Speaker 2: What a nice theatre! I guess it can seat hundreds of people.""Speaker 1: Maybe you are right.""Speaker 2: Look. It's begin.""Speaker 1: Well, How did you like the show?""Speaker 2: Will you be kind to say \"Thank you\" to Mr. Zhang and other friends for me?""Speaker 1: I'd like to. I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us. Welcome to China again.""Speaker 2: Of course, I will. Well, It's time for me to say goodbye. The plane will take off soon. Hope some day you will come to America for a visit.""Speaker 2: What was that?""Speaker 1: Relax, It was just a goat!""Speaker 2: And that?""Speaker 1: It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later.""Speaker 2: What was that?""Speaker 1: Honey, Seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax! Relax, That was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.""Speaker 2: I used to play football regularly when I was at university. And I used to do athletics in the summer.""Speaker 1: And what athletics did you play? Can you remember?""Speaker 2: I was a runner_a long-distance runner.""Speaker 1: And now?""Speaker 2: No. I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married.""Speaker 1: Well, Thank you again for coming to see us. But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams.""Speaker 2: I'm glad that you think so. I thought it might be a bit too revealing.""Speaker 1: No, Not at all. It looks really classy on you. Where did you pick that up?""Speaker 2: I got it on sale down at the department store.""Speaker 1: When did you go there?""Speaker 2: I was just there a couple of days ago. You know, You should go down there too. They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale.""Speaker 1: I might just do that. What style of clothes do they have?""Speaker 2: Right. So in some way we are happier.""Speaker 2: Look, You can still learn a lot from watching television, You just need to be smart when you're watching. Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not.""Speaker 1: The internet's a lot worse.""Speaker 2: Really? Why?""Speaker 2: What did he say?""Speaker 1: He said I'd got the flu.""Speaker 2: Oh dear! What did he tell you to do?""Speaker 1: He told me to stay in bed for ten days.""Speaker 2: Ten days? Would you please repeat it again?""Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess you're right. I think the trust game was my favorite. I think in order to have a strong team, We've all got to learn how to trust each other more.""Speaker 2: I'm going there for a tour, Too. Is this your first trip to China?""Speaker 1: Yes, It is.""Speaker 2: Why don't we go together? I can show you around. I think you'll have a better time.""Speaker 1: I couldn't agree more.""Speaker 2: I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long. A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy. Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world.""Speaker 2: Yeah, And every high school student in town is banging on your door, Right?""Speaker 1: I know they're out there. I'll find them.""Speaker 2: Thank you. It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience, You know.""Speaker 2: Well, Black people are supposed to be great dancers.""Speaker 1: Wen! That's only a stereotype. Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses. I'm not a great dancer, And you said you failed calculus.""Speaker 2: Maybe. But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account.""Speaker 1: Hey, I know what that's like. I bought a BMW on my Visa card. Now the payments really hurt.""Speaker 2: Well, You're lucky that you're still able to make your payments. I missed a credit payment last month. Now my bank account's overdrawn, And the company is threatening to take back my purchases.""Speaker 1: What did you buy?""Speaker 2: Really? How did you get the chance?""Speaker 1: I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD.""Speaker 2: My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University.""Speaker 2: The Canadian rock singer? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday. How did you see her?""Speaker 1: Yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, Her poster, A CD...""Speaker 2: So you're a big fan, Eh?""Speaker 1: Not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion designer, Too.""Speaker 2: And she was in a movie once again, Right?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Though I don't think her acting skills are that great.""Speaker 2: Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.""Speaker 1: Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?""Speaker 2: Homework, Attendance, And quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each.""Speaker 1: What if we miss something?""Speaker 2: I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time.""Speaker 1: Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?""Speaker 2: They're quite popular now. Wasn't her voice good?""Speaker 1: That, My Heart Will Go On. It warms my heart. You know, JanetJackson, Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different.""Speaker 2: Janet Jackson is more pop music. Shania sings country music. Celine just seems to hit all the right notes.""Speaker 2: A couple of days ago. I just go back from the funeral.""Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do?""Speaker 2: No... Not really. The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died. I really wanted to be there one last time.""Speaker 1: I'm sure she knew you loved her. Did she pass away in the hospital?""Speaker 2: Yeah. She died in her sleep.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry she's gone.""Speaker 2: Very good, What's on?""Speaker 2: Nonsense! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.""Speaker 1: GmAT? What does that stand for and what will the test contain?""Speaker 2: Graduate Management Admission Test, It contains three parts.""Speaker 2: Oh, My lord. I haven't really started them.""Speaker 1: How could it be? They are due two weeks later.""Speaker 2: I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days.""Speaker 1: Kate, You know, I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more. But I'm so busy! How am I going to work and study.""Speaker 2: To be honest with you, Jason, I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job. I'm always two steps behind. I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha.""Speaker 2: Well, Sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.""Speaker 1: For example?""Speaker 2: Like for example, If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.""Speaker 1: I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.""Speaker 2: You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!""Speaker 2: I don't care for a detective film. It also makes me nervous.""Speaker 1: How about a comedy?""Speaker 2: No, I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful.""Speaker 1: How about a love story then?""Speaker 2: No, Romance is boring.""Speaker 1: What's you opinion?""Speaker 2: Let's go to see a war movie, Shall we?""Speaker 2: Is that so? Why not?""Speaker 1: ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh, Dear me! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend. So we have to go to cinema instead.""Speaker 2: What's on?""Speaker 1: Let me see .. um. Gone With the Wind. It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night.""Speaker 2: That sounds interesting. Which is the nearest?""Speaker 2: Of course. There you are.""Speaker 2: How about transom?""Speaker 1: It is too loud, We'll handle some official business first before the dinner.""Speaker 2: Oh, I nearly forget it.""Speaker 2: Well, We used to talk to each other before we were married. Remember?""Speaker 1: What do you mean? We're talking now, Aren't we?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes, But we used to do so much together.""Speaker 1: Yes. I remember. But we never used to argue. You used to think I was wonderful. Where are you going?""Speaker 2: What's on the test?""Speaker 1: It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten.""Speaker 2: Well. I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam.""Speaker 1: Why are you so pessimistic?""Speaker 2: I'm not being pessimistic. I'm being realistic. My chemistry is so bad.""Speaker 1: I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation. Don't lose your heart.""Speaker 2: I actually transferred here from another school.""Speaker 1: Which school?""Speaker 2: I transferred from PCC.""Speaker 1: How do you like it here compared to PCC?""Speaker 2: I love it here.""Speaker 1: Do you like it better here or at PCC?""Speaker 2: Don't get me wrong. I like it here, But PCC is better.""Speaker 1: So, Why did you leave PCC?""Speaker 2: She never cares about others.""Speaker 1: It's true. Guess what we were talking about last night.""Speaker 2: Her new boyfriend, Right?""Speaker 1: Yeah, How do you know about that?""Speaker 1: You are right. It is giving me a real headache. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place.""Speaker 2: I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex.""Speaker 1: Oh, How did you deal with it?""Speaker 2: I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's a pity. What was the matter?""Speaker 2: You should get plenty of sleep.""Speaker 1: I drink a lot of wine.""Speaker 2: If I were you, I wouldn't drink too much.""Speaker 1: I often feel so tired.""Speaker 2: You better do some exercise every morning.""Speaker 1: I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me.""Speaker 2: Tom... You are her boss, You kown. Of course, She's helpful to you.""Speaker 1: Come on. She's like that with everyone.""Speaker 2: Why should I do that? It's only a piece of garbage. Why should you care?""Speaker 1: Because this is a public place, And I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage.""Speaker 2: Listen, I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue. It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space. It's not like there's garbage everywhere. Besides, Someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another.""Speaker 1: It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people. It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people. If everyone thought like you, There'd be garbage everywhere! The cleaners can't be everywhere!""Speaker 2: I guess so. I usually buy name-brand clothing, Shoes, And electronic goods. How about you?""Speaker 1: I actually try to avoid name-brand items. I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place!""Speaker 2: I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money, I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds.""Speaker 2: Not really, To be honest. Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me.""Speaker 1: But they are showing what will be all the rage next year.""Speaker 2: All the rage with whom? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street.""Speaker 1: Did you know that fashion is cyclical?""Speaker 2: What, It keeps coming back?""Speaker 1: Precisely! For example, Flares were popular for a while, Then went out of fashion. Now we can start to see them coming back in again.""Speaker 2: I really don't want to go into the world, I feel afraid of it.""Speaker 1: Don't be silly. We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves.""Speaker 2: Yes. An automatic message says your phone is not in service.""Speaker 1: Really? I had no idea. Let me check. Yes, It's dead. There's no dial tone.""Speaker 2: So I couldn't get through. I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start. It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater. That's why I'm late.""Speaker 1: But this is terrible. I'm expecting important calls.""Speaker 2: About what?""Speaker 2: Who's playing?""Speaker 1: It's the Powell orchestra.""Speaker 2: Do you know what they are playing?""Speaker 1: They're doing a seventeenth-century program.""Speaker 2: And who is directing?""Speaker 2: After I sign it, You must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?""Speaker 1: No, I'm not sure.""Speaker 2: When you cross the quad, The office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line.""Speaker 1: Thanks. I understand what to do now.""Speaker 2: It should be easy to find. After you add the class, Check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet.""Speaker 2: That's easy. Anything else?""Speaker 1: Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available, She can come too?""Speaker 2: Won't he be surprised!""Speaker 1: I don't know how old he is though.""Speaker 2: That's true. In summer, The first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool.""Speaker 2: No one would listen to any of my suggestions. Instead, They just kept arguing with each other.""Speaker 1: Who was chairing the meeting?""Speaker 2: Bob.""Speaker 1: Well, I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes.""Speaker 2: That's exactly what happened! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say. Then he expected everyone to agree with him.""Speaker 1: What was the meeting about?""Speaker 2: All right. But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose.""Speaker 1: My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening.""Speaker 2: What time does it begin?""Speaker 1: At eight thirty.""Speaker 2: I'll come for you at about eight.""Speaker 2: Running a farm would be totally different to you current job.""Speaker 1: That's one reason I'd like to try it. I'd really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office.""Speaker 2: You'd need a lot of training before becoming a farmer. It's not something you can just walk into.""Speaker 1: My uncle owns a farm and I'Ve spent some time working with him. I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields.""Speaker 2: Excuse me, Sir. This air compressor doesn't work.""Speaker 1: Have you turned it on?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have.""Speaker 1: Ok, I will get you another one.""Speaker 2: Have they set a date for the wedding?""Speaker 2: You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight. I think that's where you're going wrong.""Speaker 1: Why? If I eat less, Then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, Right?""Speaker 2: Not really. You should try to not eat foods high in calories, Salts or saturated fats. Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.""Speaker 2: No, I've never heard of this song before. It's beautiful! Who sing it?""Speaker 1: Elvis Presley. Don't you recognize his voice?""Speaker 2: No. How about going to karaoke tonight?""Speaker 2: Oh, I have been with my uncle for a week.""Speaker 1: What's he doing?""Speaker 2: He is an accountant. I have been helping him for a week.""Speaker 1: He must be happy.""Speaker 2: Yeah. How are you these days?""Speaker 2: We drove to the lake and had a picnic. We had a great time! How about you? Did you do anything special?""Speaker 1: Not really. I just worked on my car all day.""Speaker 2: That old thing! Why don't you just buy a new one?""Speaker 2: Oh. It's pity you have to leave.""Speaker 1: Thank you for wonderful meat.""Speaker 2: They can't spell, They can't add, They can't subtract, They even don't remember any more. That's because they rely on gadgets.""Speaker 2: Because... Oh, All right. You win. Let's pay for them and go.""Speaker 2: Good question. I have to think about it.""Speaker 1: My husband is betting on France.""Speaker 2: France? Is he crazy?""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: I'm RoseTeller. I think I'Ve seen you somewhere before?""Speaker 1: Ah, Yes. I remember now. Were you Mr. John's dinner partner last month?""Speaker 2: Yes, I was. You work for 3M, Right?""Speaker 1: I did but now I'm for Microsoft. How are things with you?""Speaker 2: Good.""Speaker 1: May I know what you do?""Speaker 2: I'm a fashion designer. Next month, I have a fashion show. I'd love it if come. I can get you a couple of tickets. So you can bring a friend if you like.""Speaker 1: Sure. That would be great. Good luck.""Speaker 2: It's approximately 3. 14, But the number continues forever. What's the diameter of your circle?""Speaker 1: It's 10 centimeters, So the circumference should be 31. 4 centimeters.""Speaker 2: Ok. My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars. What's the exchange rate at the moment?""Speaker 1: According to the newspaper, The exchange rate is 1. 85 dollars to the pound.""Speaker 2: That means that 10. 000 pounds will buy me 18. 500 dollars.""Speaker 2: It's just what I wanted.""Speaker 1: No regrets?""Speaker 2: I'm really pleased with it. Thanks.""Speaker 1: I'm glad you're so happy.""Speaker 2: No tipping? Now that's what I call a civilized system.""Speaker 1: At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill, But other than that, Tipping isn't customary.""Speaker 2: No, Frank. I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now.""Speaker 1: It's certainly a popular hobby. I know a lot of people love stamps.""Speaker 2: It certainly is. It's so much fun.""Speaker 1: I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right?""Speaker 2: Absolutely. Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world.""Speaker 1: Well, Every stamp has a story to tell.""Speaker 2: It is the Colorado River. You will go down the river in a boat if you wish.""Speaker 1: No, Thank you. It looks a bit too dangerous for me.""Speaker 2: There is a beautiful state park here. I can see why so many people come out here to camp.""Speaker 1: Yes, There is this beautiful view. You may go fishing, Camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air.""Speaker 2: It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city.""Speaker 2: My exam.""Speaker 1: Oh, Is that all?""Speaker 2: I feel very nervous about it.""Speaker 2: Sorry, Sally, It's not your fault.""Speaker 1: So, What's the problem?""Speaker 2: I drew a blank on ~ about the test.""Speaker 1: No kidding! Didn't you study for it?""Speaker 2: Yeah, But nothing was clear during the test.""Speaker 1: That's too bad, Anyway, I'm sure things will turn around next master.""Speaker 2: I'm thinking of dropping out.""Speaker 1: You can't do that, Jenny!""Speaker 2: I'm dead serious about this, Sally.""Speaker 2: You're joking!""Speaker 2: I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. That's a real let-down.""Speaker 1: I don't think she will do such a thing.""Speaker 2: But she did and made me disappointed.""Speaker 1: Oh, Cheer up. A girlfriend is not everything.""Speaker 2: But she means a lot to me.""Speaker 1: Then forgive her mistake.""Speaker 2: If I were you, I would change the beginning. You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities.""Speaker 1: Good idea, Betty. What would you think about the second part?""Speaker 2: I think it's too short. You'd better say something about your work experience.""Speaker 1: You're right, I'll change it. How about the last part?""Speaker 2: And the people were so friendly!""Speaker 1: Yeah, We would have been lost without the help of the locals.""Speaker 2: Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street?""Speaker 1: Of course. That was the best pasta I've ever had.""Speaker 2: I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day.""Speaker 2: Oh, They all went out! Did you make a wish?""Speaker 1: Yes, But I doubt if I get it. I've never get it.""Speaker 2: Do you mean you want to sell up your company of your own?""Speaker 1: There's a possibility. What do you say?""Speaker 2: We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks, But apart from that, Summers are dry. Thunderstorms make the air fresh again, So most people don't mind then.""Speaker 1: What are spring and autumn like?""Speaker 2: I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, The weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, Sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny an.""Speaker 1: Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, So our summertime is your wintertime, And vice versa. We get some rain in every season, But most is in winter. In winter, It sometimes gets cold, But our wine.""Speaker 2: Sure.""Speaker 1: I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this. Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you. All you have to do it get on the train tonight a.""Speaker 2: The train? Will I be flying back then?""Speaker 1: Oh, No. We've brought your return ticket for you. I think you'll find it comfortable.""Speaker 2: It's leap my mind. I really feel terrible about it.""Speaker 1: I have been looking forward to this performance all month.""Speaker 2: Do you really think so? I don't. It will just make us fat and act silly. Remember last time?""Speaker 1: I guess you are right. But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.""Speaker 2: I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong. Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.""Speaker 2: First of all, They have an excellent benefits package for all employees, Even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage.""Speaker 1: Really? What about the pay rate? Are the wages pretty high?""Speaker 2: Yeah. Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world.""Speaker 1: That's why many people died in the earthquake.""Speaker 2: Well, China is located on the Eurasia plate, Where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other.""Speaker 1: Oh, China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history.""Speaker 2: Yeah, We've experienced the 8. 0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman.""Speaker 2: We all went swimming.""Speaker 1: Are you going swimming again this afternoon?""Speaker 2: No, We aren't.

They are emitted directly into urban water supplies.""Speaker 2: Take care and give my best to your parents.""Speaker 1: Good-bye. Hope to see you soon again next year.""Speaker 2: I think we can visit West Lake. The landscapes are attractive. It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven, There are Su Thou and Hang Thou on earth.""Speaker 1: It's surely worth going to. There are ten famous spots there.""Speaker 2: What can we do next after locating the place?""Speaker 2: Are you going to see them soon?""Speaker 2: Wait a minute. Cal's bar?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: That's a gay bar.""Speaker 1: Yes, It is. Conrad is gay. Didn't you know?""Speaker 2: I thought he was maybe gay, But I wasn't sure. Anyhow, You don't expect me to go into a gay bar, Do you?""Speaker 1: Why not? We're supposed to meet him there.""Speaker 2: Why doesn't he meet us outside?""Speaker 1: Why should he do that? It isn't illegal for us to go in.""Speaker 2: I wouldn't say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Good idea. We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill. I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.""Speaker 1: Great! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.""Speaker 2: I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time.""Speaker 1: Well, The weather is so unpredictable this time of year.""Speaker 2: You're right. We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Look! It looks as if it is going to rain.""Speaker 2: The weatherman predicts a fine day today.""Speaker 2: She's very fond of detective stories?""Speaker 1: I see. Has she read any detective stories?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes!""Speaker 1: Do you know if she's read this one?""Speaker 2: I'm not sure, But she probably won't remember if she has! She's very forgetful!""Speaker 1: Ah! She has a bad memory. How old is she?""Speaker 2: She's eighty-seven.""Speaker 2: Not anymore. They live with my brother now. And yours?""Speaker 1: My parents live by themselves now. When they get older, They'll probably go to a retirement home. Do you just have one brother?""Speaker 2: No, I have two older brothers and one younger sister. What about you?""Speaker 2: Horses are useful to people too. We use them for sports and recreation.""Speaker 1: Don't forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts.""Speaker 2: What's wrong?""Speaker 1: There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.""Speaker 2: I see! Do you want to ask her out?""Speaker 1: Sure, But how?""Speaker 2: You can ask her out for drink after work.""Speaker 1: But for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.""Speaker 2: Then you've got a lot of homework to do. You need to get her notice first.""Speaker 1: Easier said than done.""Speaker 2: Spring.""Speaker 1: How about summer?""Speaker 2: I dislike it most.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: Because the hottest season is summer in a year.""Speaker 2: No, I went for an interview.""Speaker 1: Oh, Did you get a job?""Speaker 2: Yes, I got a job as a Management Trainee.""Speaker 2: Of course not.""Speaker 2: No way! I like my apartment, And I like to be independent.""Speaker 1: Do you ever get lonely living alone?""Speaker 2: She said it was because we had very different ideas about life.""Speaker 1: Do you believe her excuse?""Speaker 2: Of course not. I knew she had fallen in love with another guy. It is difficult to see her move on so quickly.""Speaker 1: Come on, Buddy, Cheer up. Why not do some sports with me? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love.""Speaker 2: But I can't sing it well.""Speaker 1: It doesn't matter. No one will laugh at you.""Speaker 2: Ok, I'Il go with you. When shall we go?""Speaker 1: What about six?""Speaker 2: It's too early. Let's make it seven, Ok?""Speaker 2: Let's just say there could be some big changes around here.""Speaker 1: Is that right? Like what kind of changes?""Speaker 2: You'll see. Oh, Yeah, You'll see.""Speaker 2: Fine, Thanks. I'll have a party next Sunday at home. I'm calling to ask whether you can come or not.""Speaker 1: Oh, How wonderful. I'll be glad to.""Speaker 2: Okay, Now you are a famous star.""Speaker 1: Hum, Don't say that. Maybe you can do something useful for me.""Speaker 2: What's wrong with you?""Speaker 1: I'll tell you at the party.""Speaker 2: For which one?""Speaker 1: Sense and Sensibility, English version.""Speaker 2: Yes, Of course.""Speaker 1: Can I just do it here?""Speaker 2: Sorry. No. You should go to the other counter.""Speaker 1: Ok, Thanks.""Speaker 2: Sorry, This biography is over the deadline. You should pay extra for it.""Speaker 1: I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library... Anyway, How much should I pay?""Speaker 2: 3 Yuan, Please.""Speaker 2: Not so well. To be honest with you, I broke up with Tom.""Speaker 2: Should I take my shoes off?""Speaker 1: Whatever you prefer.""Speaker 2: This is a very nice place. How long have you been living here now?""Speaker 1: Just over three weeks.

I like the sound of stepping on the snow very much.""Speaker 2: Yes. Very wonderful.""Speaker 1: Do you smell the sweet scent?""Speaker 2: Yes. It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms.""Speaker 2: Step out of the vehicle, Please. Sir, What do you have in the back?""Speaker 1: Just a few Christmas gifts,'tis the season, After all!""Speaker 2: Don't take that tone with me. Do you have an invoice for these items?""Speaker 1: Umm... No... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole!""Speaker 2: He has a bad cold.""Speaker 1: Well, Tell him to take it easy and that I hope he feels better.""Speaker 2: To get started, Take that list over to the bookstore. Do you know where the bookstore is?""Speaker 1: I am not sure where the bookstore is.""Speaker 2: When you pass the gym, It'll be the first door on the left. Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money?""Speaker 1: Yes, I knew I could do that. Exactly how do I go about selling them?""Speaker 2: If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door, He will reimburse you. Can you go over there today?""Speaker 2: No, It's last year's model.""Speaker 1: True. How much did you pay?""Speaker 2: $ 14, 500. It only has 10, 000 miles on it, So it's like a new car.""Speaker 1: Does that mean you're not going to take the train to work anymore?""Speaker 2: Well, Sometimes, I think it'll be nice to drive to work instead. We'll see. Want to go for a ride?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Sure.""Speaker 2: I am sure it will be.

That would be really helpful.""Speaker 2: Are you going to have a birthday party?""Speaker 2: I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I'm a junior, But...""Speaker 1: Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.""Speaker 2: I know, But geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field.""Speaker 1: Well, If you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.""Speaker 2: I'm doing fine, Thanks. What's new with you?""Speaker 1: Nothing special.""Speaker 2: I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week?""Speaker 1: Sounds good. Sorry, Here comes my bus. You call me, Or I'll call you to make a date.""Speaker 2: I'll call you.""Speaker 1: All right. Gotta go, Bye, Keep in touch.""Speaker 2: I might be able to do that. But I don't think I can do it well.""Speaker 1: Don't worry. It is a test of physical endurance, Intelligence. Just to finish it is considered a victory for most.""Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't think so.""Speaker 1: I do wish I could lose weight.""Speaker 2: Well, Why don't you go on the diet?""Speaker 1: I've tried diets before but they've never worked.""Speaker 2: Perhaps you should excercise more. Why don't you go to an exercise class.""Speaker 2: Sounds a good weekend. You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I never thought we could be good friends either. We have our differences. She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed, But we still get along extremely well. We can talk for hours about anything.""Speaker 2: That's great. I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes.""Speaker 2: I went to the library and lost my bag.""Speaker 1: Your bag? Did you get it back?""Speaker 2: I went back for it. But it was already gone.""Speaker 2: What about tomorrow? Are you doing anything tomorrow?""Speaker 1: No, I haven't got any plans.""Speaker 2: Shall we go out tomorrow then?""Speaker 2: Actually, I could you some help. Thank you so much.""Speaker 2: I mean if you don't sell your shares now, It's quite likely that you'll end up losing your shirt.""Speaker 1: Is that so?""Speaker 2: No, Thanks. I am okay.""Speaker 1: You'd better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September...""Speaker 2: Well, Actually, I am thinking about living off campus.""Speaker 1: Do you have any idea how much that would cost?""Speaker 2: I know it would be more expensive. I think I could handle it though. It's that this dorm is so noisy that I can't get anything done.""Speaker 2: Yes, If it's not too much of a trouble.""Speaker 1: It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place.""Speaker 2: You're welcome. The rain is quite heavy, Isn't it?""Speaker 1: Yeah. I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today.""Speaker 2: I have one. We could share it. Which way are you going?""Speaker 1: Oh, That's very kind of you. I am going to the Garden Hotel.""Speaker 2: I am going there, Too. We can walk together.""Speaker 2: Thank you for the invitation. I'll be very happy to go.""Speaker 1: Good!""Speaker 2: What time should I arrive?""Speaker 1: How about 6:00?""Speaker 2: Please look at the sky. Don't you see the dark clouds? It's going to rain soon.""Speaker 1: Good. So we don't have to work. How nice!""Speaker 2: But I don't think it's so nice.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week.""Speaker 2: I lived in England when I was a child.""Speaker 1: What else can you speak?""Speaker 2: That's right. However, Players can only pass the ball backwards. They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates. That's a foul.""Speaker 1: I know how goals are scored in football, But how about in rugby?""Speaker 2: No need for that. It's not usually busy on weekdays.""Speaker 1: What time shall we go?""Speaker 2: Yes, I know, But she's dangerous.""Speaker 1: Really? Tell me more.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm not one to gossip, As you know, But rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment.""Speaker 1: Wow, Crikey. So what happened?""Speaker 2: Well, This is just between ourselves, Of course, But he was her lover and he wanted to leave her, So she got revenge. I heard him say she was a dangerous woman.""Speaker 1: Wow.""Speaker 2: I expected too high from that movie, But I was a bit disappointed about it.""Speaker 1: But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week.""Speaker 2: Box office can't explain everything. I do not think it is cheerful or well-made. The plot is old and the female character is not pretty.""Speaker 1: My sister has given me two tickets for tonight. It is called 'The life of Rose', A French movie.""Speaker 2: What's it about?""Speaker 2: On, What're you doing? You look as busy as a bee.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to decorate my house.""Speaker 2: Really, That's cool. Let me see what you'Ve done.""Speaker 1: But actually it's not done yet. I'm going to get a special pendent lamp.""Speaker 2: That's all right. Let me see, Oh, That lace looks so unique, And it's so creative to make a picture display here. How did you get that idea?""Speaker 2: No, I think the music is too fast.""Speaker 1: How about the words of the song?""Speaker 2: It sounds nice.""Speaker 1: I like it. Naturally it can arouse your feelings.""Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. It's very emotional.""Speaker 1: Of course, And I also like the rhythms.""Speaker 2: Full of energy and hope.""Speaker 1: Really. It's worth listening to and enjoying.""Speaker 2: Great! Is your, Too?""Speaker 1: Sorry, Nope. But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight.""Speaker 2: My grandpa. He has the final word about almost everything. My grandpa is “ President, � and Grandma is “ Vice-President. � My parents, Uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions.""Speaker 1: Is a family like yours common in South Korea?""Speaker 2: No. Not anymore. Mine is highly educated but traditional family. Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller. In traditional families, The old people are well respected and taken good care of. Ho.""Speaker 2: Did you play network games the whole night?""Speaker 1: No, I listened to the music, Too.""Speaker 2: What are you going to do now?""Speaker 2: Don't mention it. It was the least I could do.""Speaker 1: If there's ever anything I can do for you, Don't hesitate to let me know.""Speaker 2: Thank you.""Speaker 1: I'm most grateful.""Speaker 2: Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup!""Speaker 1: I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, How can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time?""Speaker 2: You'Ve got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?""Speaker 1: Look, We have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, And it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, It's probably not a good idea to keep it up I'm willing to forgive and forget and if you are.""Speaker 2: They need to eat healthy foods, But they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day. They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, Though.""Speaker 1: So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate?""Speaker 2: Sure, They can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, There's nothing wrong with having a small desert.""Speaker 2: No. But I am going to apply for some vocational schools. I like fashion design and want to study it.""Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I'm not married. I'm still single.""Speaker 1: Then, When do you plan to get married?""Speaker 2: Never mind, The odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed.""Speaker 1: I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior.""Speaker 2: Don't pretend you are a good God.""Speaker 1: You should feel shameful for your behavior.""Speaker 2: I've never experienced such a kind of feeling.""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 2: I'd love to help you out, But I'm a bit short on cash this month as well. I had to get a new engine put into my car, And that ate up my savings.""Speaker 1: If you can't give me the full amount, A fraction of it would still help. I'll pay you back on Monday. I promise.""Speaker 2: Let's see, I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend. I can only spare about $ 20. I would give you more if I had it, I just don't have much money to my name right now.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I suppose. I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather.""Speaker 1: No, It's not. Not at all. I'd probably freeze my lungs.""Speaker 2: Wait for me a minute. I'll go over to the gym too.""Speaker 1: You?""Speaker 2: Yes, Why not? Just let me get my gym clothes together.""Speaker 1: I didn't know you could exercise.""Speaker 2: What do you mean by that?

I'm not sure I'd be good enough to play in a band.""Speaker 1: I wish I could play a musical instrument. I love music.""Speaker 2: Nowadays, You can be a DJ. You can mix dance music. You don't need to be able to play musical instrument or sing.""Speaker 1: I'd love to try it. But the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice.""Speaker 2: She's a real turn-on our rights.""Speaker 1: And look out she's dressed.""Speaker 1: I think you've lost it.""Speaker 2: Oh, There is no comparison.

Let's trade places one weekend!""Speaker 2: Be seeing you then.""Speaker 2: How did the business trip go?""Speaker 1: Well, To be honest, Nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss.""Speaker 2: I understand. The last time I went on a business trip with the boss, I didn't even have enough to eat!""Speaker 1: I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses.

I was in your position before. At that time I couldn't depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.""Speaker 1: What about your mother? Did she help you?""Speaker 2: Yes, She did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can't depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter.

Ok, Go on.""Speaker 2: Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat.""Speaker 1: Who do you think will be elected?""Speaker 2: It's hard to say. They all had an active campaign to round up the votes.""Speaker 1: I think Mr. White would be elected, You know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech.""Speaker 2: That could explain all his stomachaches. He's trying to hide it from us.""Speaker 1: Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck. Have you seen him?""Speaker 2: Have you noticed what has changed?""Speaker 1: Oh, You look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?""Speaker 2: Yes.

We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it.""Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't think of that.

It is all over now. How was it going, Anyway?""Speaker 1: I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, But they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, The manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me.""Speaker 2: That's strange. But probably, It is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ”. What about your answers?""Speaker 2: He is tall and slim, Fair-haired.""Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?""Speaker 2: He is a nice guy and very considerate.

What are you talking about?""Speaker 2: Stop producing cigarettes.""Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.""Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.""Speaker 1: How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet?""Speaker 2: It was great. The director took a lot of care while framing. They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director. Also I like the actors, Some really great new young actors.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yeah? What's it about?""Speaker 2: Well, It's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds. But besides a beautiful story, The cinematography is great. There is some really dramatic footage. It's really quite a visual feast. And the soundtrack is moving.""Speaker 1: Sounds pretty good. Is it a tragedy?""Speaker 2: I'd like to. But I'm afraid I can't.""Speaker 1: I'm wondering if you like to go to the theatre then.""Speaker 2: That's sounds great.""Speaker 1: Ok.

Would that be OK?""Speaker 1: Ok, Let's do the calculation.""Speaker 2: What time do you want me there?""Speaker 1: Anytime after six will be fine.""Speaker 2: They still live in Shanghai where I was born.""Speaker 1: Do you write or call them very much?""Speaker 2: You speak English very well.""Speaker 1: Thank you.""Speaker 2: Do you know what time it is?""Speaker 1: Sure. It's 5:10 PM.""Speaker 2: What did you say?""Speaker 1: I said it's 5:10 PM.""Speaker 2: Thanks.""Speaker 2: There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium. It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services.""Speaker 1: That's true.

Customers, In turn, Can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered.""Speaker 2: How did you know?""Speaker 1: You always act like this when you'Ve fallen in love. Who is he? How did you meet?""Speaker 2: His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos. He works with my sister who lives there.""Speaker 1: Was it love at first sight?""Speaker 2: Not really.

Why not? I hear it's pretty good.""Speaker 1: The people don't really work out there. They just stand around and talk all the time.""Speaker 2: Oh, It's one of those places.""Speaker 1: Yeah, Is your club different?""Speaker 2: Well, They have different rooms. I lift weights by the pool where there aren't so many people.""Speaker 1: Do they have a lot of equipment?""Speaker 2: I only had time to visit Edinburgh.""Speaker 1: How did you like it?""Speaker 2: It's fantastic.""Speaker 1: Why did you go there?""Speaker 2: I went there on business.""Speaker 1: And do you have friends there?""Speaker 2: Yes, A lot of friends.""Speaker 1: You must have enjoyed yourself.""Speaker 2: Yeah?

They were well respected.""Speaker 2: It seems that the inner beauty is also important.""Speaker 2: The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster, So the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow. I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat.""Speaker 2: I find it there is no meaning in living this world.""Speaker 1: Don't be that negative.""Speaker 2: Smith.""Speaker 2: And special TV programs, Fire crackers and the games to play.""Speaker 1: Hey, Do you know any mystery belief serve the festival?""Speaker 2: Such as?""Speaker 1: You know why fire crackers are set off in festival.""Speaker 2: Why?

That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, And offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent. And the ball is often kept flying overhead, Drawing beautiful curves in the sky. Such games are quite pleasing to the eye.""Speaker 2: Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?""Speaker 1: I will be driving my car.""Speaker 2: Ok, That will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?""Speaker 1: I'll pay for it with a check.""Speaker 2: Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?""Speaker 1: No, Thanks ; I'm fine.""Speaker 2: I've already got your certificate for sick leave. How do you feel today?""Speaker 1: I feel much better now.""Speaker 2: Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday?""Speaker 1: I've already got it. Thanks.""Speaker 2: I will explain it in detail in the next class, Could you preview it?""Speaker 2: Yes. I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted.""Speaker 1: Just because he gets on well with everybody?""Speaker 2: You can see the Forbidden City.""Speaker 1: What's it like?""Speaker 2: He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, But I also worry about grades.""Speaker 2: Grades are important, But don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, Too?""Speaker 1: I really need to learn this stuff.""Speaker 2: He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?""Speaker 2: Ma'am, I'm sorry. The cancer ward said Mr. Smith passed away two days ago.""Speaker 1: That's impossible! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith.""Speaker 2: Yes, Ma'am. He died from complications of stomach cancer. I'm very sorry.""Speaker 2: Please don't tell me you bought it.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: Well, You have to get 166 credits, Including required courses and optional courses.""Speaker 1: Ok. And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree?""Speaker 2: It can be completed in four years normally.""Speaker 1: I see. Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: Who's playing?""Speaker 1: It's the Powell orchestra.""Speaker 2: Do you know what they are playing?""Speaker 1: They're doing a seventeenth-century program.""Speaker 2: And who is directing?""Speaker 2: Ever hear of WebTracker?""Speaker 1: You wouldn't! If you leave, You'll make nothing.""Speaker 2: I might make nothing even if I stay. For that kind of risk, I want to get rich.""Speaker 2: Hmm. Let's see... There was Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poet's Society, The Fisher King... Three, Right?""Speaker 2: I will, Do you want me to bring anything?""Speaker 2: I like hot food, EspeciallySichuan cuisine.""Speaker 1: Would you like another beer?""Speaker 2: I'II have another cup of beer insist. I know I don't like to drink alone, Especially there are someone sitting there next to me.""Speaker 1: Come on, It's the weekend. Let's taste and enjoy this meal. Cheers!""Speaker 2: Well, You know I have some students studying for their master's degree. One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy.""Speaker 1: What gift?""Speaker 2: It's an Egyptian carpet. The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude. Seeing what gift was, I was really uncomfortable. I mean it's too expensive a gift.""Speaker 1: You refused the gift? That's terrible.""Speaker 2: Yes, Sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night.""Speaker 1: I hope I can stay here longer.""Speaker 2: When will your vacation end?""Speaker 1: The day after tomorrow.""Speaker 2: You will go back tomorrow, Right?""Speaker 2: Where did you go?""Speaker 1: True, A sea food restaurant.""Speaker 2: True? The food is terrible.""Speaker 1: I didn't notice. I don't really even know what I ate.""Speaker 2: Great! Uh, Remember that there's a gift exchange, Too. We all have to bring a gift.""Speaker 1: I've already got mine.""Speaker 2: ( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve! Time to open presents!""Speaker 1: Here! Open mine first.""Speaker 2: Wow! It's just what I wanted!""Speaker 2: You like it, Huh?""Speaker 1: Who wouldn't? Wow, That's out of this world.""Speaker 2: It is special, Isn't it?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Too cool. How much did they sold you for?""Speaker 2: Lots. Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years.""Speaker 1: I can imagine.""Speaker 2: Hey, Let's go for a spin. You can try it out.""Speaker 1: I'd love to.""Speaker 2: What's the time? My watch has stopped.""Speaker 1: It's half past twelve.""Speaker 2: When do you have lunch?""Speaker 1: From one to two.""Speaker 2: What do you normally eat?""Speaker 1: We usually go to the cafeteria.""Speaker 2: Oh, It's time to have lunch now.""Speaker 2: You are welcome at any time.""Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality. I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay.""Speaker 2: You are most welcome.""Speaker 1: I'm afraid I have to go now. The plane will take off soon.""Speaker 2: I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315. I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325! I sniped him!""Speaker 2: How come?""Speaker 1: I was sick that day, And couldn't make it.""Speaker 2: Well, Here are the notes.""Speaker 1: Are there any more?""Speaker 2: Sorry, Here you go.""Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.""Speaker 2: My favorite winter sport is skiing. In addition, I am keen on basketball.""Speaker 1: What do you like doing in your spare time?""Speaker 2: I like doing aerobics in my spare time. It's good for my health.""Speaker 1: Do you have any hobbies?""Speaker 2: Ok, I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch. It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time. I am sure they don't want to miss it.""Speaker 2: No. I transferred here from a different school.""Speaker 1: What school?""Speaker 2: I transferred here from PCC.""Speaker 1: Do you like it here?""Speaker 2: I really like it here so far.""Speaker 1: Do you like it better here or at PCC?""Speaker 2: I like PCC better.""Speaker 1: If that's the case, Then why did you leave?""Speaker 2: It was my pleasure. How about this evening? I feel very hungry now.""Speaker 1: Fine, I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area, Food there is pretty spicy too. Shall we try that one?""Speaker 2: Really? That's unusual for October, Isn't it?""Speaker 1: Well, You could never tell about the weather here in New York.""Speaker 2: Ok, Lovely boy. Try to be patient. Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up?""Speaker 1: As far as I know, People will be weak if they swim too long.""Speaker 2: That's right. But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming.""Speaker 2: Don't forget the sun block lotion. You don't want a sunburn, Do you?""Speaker 2: Oh, My goodness. Who do I need to talk to?""Speaker 1: My employer. Can you come in to the office tomorrow?""Speaker 2: Absolutely. I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere.""Speaker 1: That would be the real proof. Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane?""Speaker 2: Yes, It's my favorite.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's a disco. Let's dance.""Speaker 2: You're a good dancer.""Speaker 1: Thank you. Now they are playing a rumba. Would you have a try?""Speaker 2: Sorry. I feel like sitting out the next dance.""Speaker 1: Ok. Let's get something to drink.""Speaker 2: His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion.""Speaker 1: Poor Kevin, We should do something for him. He is a nice guy and does his job well.""Speaker 2: Well, If spicy local dishes are what you are looking for, In Hua Restaurant is the best place to go. The restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes. You might want to try there.""Speaker 1: How far is it from here?""Speaker 2: Ok, That's a good idea. Where shall we meet?""Speaker 1: Well how about meeting at my place?""Speaker 2: What would you like me to do?""Speaker 1: I want you to cut my hair shorter.""Speaker 2: How short?""Speaker 1: I want my hair to be only a few inches long.""Speaker 2: Do you really want it that short?""Speaker 1: Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now.""Speaker 2: If you really want me to, Then I'll do it.""Speaker 1: I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want.""Speaker 2: In the spring.""Speaker 1: Oh, Lovely. Where's the wedding going to be?""Speaker 2: Well .. we're not sure yet, Probably in St. Albans.""Speaker 1: Oh, Yes, Your parents live there, Don't they?""Speaker 2: Yes, That's right.""Speaker 1: Where are you going to live after you're married?""Speaker 2: We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London.""Speaker 1: Are you going to give up your job?""Speaker 2: Happy birthday, Peter, And many happy returns of the day. Here's a present for you.""Speaker 1: Thank you, Li Mei. Come into the dining room. I'm going to cut the cake soon.""Speaker 2: What wish do you make?""Speaker 2: I sometimes use traveller's cheques, But sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash.""Speaker 1: Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills? I use direct debit.""Speaker 2: Why not start with the most interesting one?""Speaker 1: Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, The harder to make a decision.""Speaker 2: And he's bright and intelligent. I'm sure he can pass the university entrance exam.""Speaker 1: I wish he could too.""Speaker 2: How's your boy, Jack?""Speaker 1: He's a bit tired, You know. It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up.""Speaker 2: Poor boys! They work harder at school nowadays, Don't they?""Speaker 2: Well, How about the Museum of Modern Art?""Speaker 1: No, I don't like museums. They're boring.""Speaker 2: Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building?""Speaker 2: You saw a ghost? When?""Speaker 1: It was many years ago, When I was a little child. It was the middle of the night, And I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen. I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, When...""Speaker 2: So that's where you saw the ghost? In your house? What did it look like? Was it hideous?""Speaker 1: It was a big, Green thing that looked like a person. It was in the kitchen, And it slowly moved towards the stairs...""Speaker 2: Cool!""Speaker 1: I know girls love this kind of car. Look, It's got a sunroof! Imagine... A cool, Starry night...""Speaker 2: So, You're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks?""Speaker 2: It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one. What do you think? Do you want to quit your job?""Speaker 2: Say hi to your parents for me. I hope to see them soon.""Speaker 1: Thank you. Well, If you ever pass my home, Please drop in.""Speaker 2: Yes, I will. Take care, Then.""Speaker 2: Yes, They are. This afternoon, I'm going to prune the hedge.""Speaker 1: The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low. Would you like me to cut them off for you?""Speaker 2: Thank you! That would be very kind of you. I have a saw in the garden shed.""Speaker 1: When the lower branches are removed, You'll be able to sit under the tree.""Speaker 2: Good gracious. That's incredible!""Speaker 1: She married Jerrod.""Speaker 2: You're kidding.""Speaker 1: She's going to live in Paris.""Speaker 2: No, Not yet, But I do feel a little feverish.""Speaker 1: How long have you been feeling this way?""Speaker 2: Only since this morning.""Speaker 1: Oh, Probably you've been working too hard.""Speaker 2: It's no use complaining. If we had got enough money, We couldn't put up with it, And would have moved out.""Speaker 2: The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers. They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others.""Speaker 1: I noticed that too. What are the people learning?""Speaker 2: I like No. 4.""Speaker 1: You mean Sweet Heart.""Speaker 2: Yes. In fact, I think it's much better than this week's No. 1.""Speaker 1: What do you think about Cold Wind?""Speaker 2: I like it as well, But I don't think it's as good as Sweet Heart.""Speaker 1: So No. 4 is your favorite. Which one don't you like?""Speaker 2: Well. I don't like Your Lips very much.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: There are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to. I can never seem to choose. I let my parents make big decisions for me. They chose my university and my course. I ended up studying something.""Speaker 1: Your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren't careful! Why don't you try being more decisive? Start with some basic ones. When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at,Mak.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. You're very decisive, I'Ve noticed. So, Which bar are we going to this evening?""Speaker 2: Really? In my eyes it's normal, As an old man, To be thin is better than to be fat.""Speaker 2: Oh... That's OK... As long as you're buying!""Speaker 1: I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about.""Speaker 2: I'd love to help if I can.""Speaker 1: Well, As you know, I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far, But I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work... Maybe even get a Doctorate!""Speaker 2: Wow! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain.""Speaker 2: Don't you know Christmas is coming? I have a lot of things to get ready.""Speaker 1: But you're in China. Are you planning on going home for Christmas?""Speaker 2: Yeah, So I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave.""Speaker 1: Why not just give them money in red envelopes? That would be much easier.""Speaker 2: Americans don't like giving money, They prefer presents you buy for them. So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends.""Speaker 1: I've got it. I won't bother you any more. You'd better hurry to do it, Christmas is just around the corner.""Speaker 2: My father supports the family, And he is the sole breadwinner. My mother is a housewife.""Speaker 1: Do you live with your family?""Speaker 2: Well, Sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.""Speaker 1: For example?""Speaker 2: Like for example, If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.""Speaker 1: I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.""Speaker 2: You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!""Speaker 2: Certainly. What's your topic?""Speaker 1: I'm looking for information on tropical fish.""Speaker 2: All right. You can use the computer over there, Enter 'tropical fish'under subject. If you know the title of the book, Enter it under' title '.""Speaker 1: Great, Thank you.""Speaker 2: Here you go. I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt.""Speaker 1: No. You go ahead and putt it out. Then I'Il go.""Speaker 2: It doesn't matter. Go back the way you came. After about five kilometers, You'll see a hotel on the side of the road. It's a big one. You can't miss it.""Speaker 1: And then?""Speaker 2: Take the next right. Drive about one click further, And you'll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall.""Speaker 1: Thanks a lot.""Speaker 2: I've heard. She looks quite depressed.""Speaker 1: Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.""Speaker 2: I heard they were just married for 5 months.""Speaker 1: Yes, She said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things.""Speaker 2: Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden.""Speaker 1: You said it. You know, They fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.""Speaker 2: Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.""Speaker 2: That's nice. What do they have you doing over there?""Speaker 1: Well, I work in the marketing department. The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer. Before, When I was assigned a task, I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don.""Speaker 2: That's really good. It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work.""Speaker 1: Indeed. Team work is highly valued in this new company. I like our boss too. He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation. He's highly respected by all his employees.""Speaker 2: I wouldn't mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice, But it would get tedious after a while. Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you.""Speaker 1: No-one really believes gossip columnists.""Speaker 2: Were there any animals in the forest?""Speaker 2: Good idea.""Speaker 1: Who will sing in the show?""Speaker 2: A lot of stars, Including Andy, Justin, Mendy...""Speaker 1: Mendy? Are you sure? I love her songs!""Speaker 2: Me too. She is so young and talented. She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself.""Speaker 2: Olympus.""Speaker 1: Do you own your own darkroom?""Speaker 2: No, Usually I get my films developed at a photo studio, But I make my own enlargements.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: I guess I never thought of that before.""Speaker 1: And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, Or from the government.""Speaker 2: It should be, But there are too many options. My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices, But after that...""Speaker 1: I know. You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, A big school or a small school, A public or private school...""Speaker 2: Yup, You understand. And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college. They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline. And the tuition is usually pretty low.""Speaker 1: I see. Well, Don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school. He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction. He gave me some information, And next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters, But not to pour oil on the flame.""Speaker 2: It's not about pay raise or promotion. You know, I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night.""Speaker 1: ThenSOHO is your ideal work style.""Speaker 2: They are announcing your flight. You'd better board the plane.""Speaker 1: Are you rushing me?""Speaker 2: I am just reminding you about the time. You don't want to miss the plane, Do you?""Speaker 1: I know what I am doing. Don't worry. Can you do me a favor?""Speaker 2: Name it and I'll do it for you.""Speaker 1: Take care of Pamela when I am away. She is a nice girl. I don't want her to get hurt or anything.""Speaker 2: I've got it.""Speaker 2: It rained all day yesterday. The weather was awful last week.""Speaker 1: What will the weather be like tomorrow?""Speaker 2: It's about Bob Dylan.""Speaker 1: Who is he?""Speaker 2: He's a famous American musician.""Speaker 1: Who's the author?""Speaker 2: It was written by Howard Sounds.""Speaker 1: What do you think about it?""Speaker 2: It's great! I'Ve learned a lot from reading it.""Speaker 1: Can I read it when you're done?""Speaker 2: Sure, Bob! I'm on chapter 12 now, So I'm almost finished.""Speaker 1: How many chapters does the book have?""Speaker 1: How are your work now?""Speaker 2: You're in one of those in-between stages, Aren't you.""Speaker 1: Yes, It's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy.""Speaker 2: Have you thought about wearing a hat?""Speaker 1: Everywhere I go?""Speaker 2: No way! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation?""Speaker 1: Absolutely! I don't think any planes are going anywhere. The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters. But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest.""Speaker 2: That's exactly where I was planning to go!""Speaker 2: They say you shouldn't mix love and work.""Speaker 1: That's silly. What I do on my own time is no one else's business. Besides, It's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here.""Speaker 2: You'Ve got a point. Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism. Then when the relationship went bad, He fired me.""Speaker 1: People fall in love with people they work with. That's a fact.""Speaker 2: I hope to do a little gardening. I find it very relaxing.""Speaker 1: I might do that too. I hope the weather is nice. I could go and play some golf.""Speaker 2: I heard that the weather should be good. There's a possibility of a shower, But it's not very likely.""Speaker 1: Hopefully, We'll both have relaxing weekends.""Speaker 2: Of course, Something could come up and stop that wish coming true.""Speaker 2: Gosh!""Speaker 1: That's too much for us really.""Speaker 2: Where are you going now?""Speaker 1: I'm going to try to find out where the school is located.""Speaker 2: When do you start school?""Speaker 1: I'm going to register right now.""Speaker 2: Thursday? Oh, Sorry. I meant thursday too. I mean I busy then too.""Speaker 1: I see. Oh, Well some other time perhaps.""Speaker 2: I've absolutely certain.""Speaker 1: Were you in or out? Can you remember that?""Speaker 2: I'm not quite positive. I think I went out at about half pass nine.""Speaker 1: Did you see anyone come into the block flats?""Speaker 2: No, I didn't.""Speaker 1: Sure?""Speaker 2: Maybe we all should learn something from him.""Speaker 2: For sure! I mean we'Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding, How to check for a pulse, And even how to apply CPR!""Speaker 1: Have you treated any real emergencies?""Speaker 2: Well, They took us along with some paramedics. There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures. His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital. It was intense!""Speaker 2: The reason I'm calling is because Ms. Collins will not be able to call you back until next week.""Speaker 1: Oh. I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday.""Speaker 2: She's terribly sorry about that. She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week. She hopes you understand.""Speaker 1: Is there someone else I can talk to?""Speaker 2: She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today. When are you free today?""Speaker 2: Bill, You know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing. And skipping meals will not help you lose weight. In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals.""Speaker 1: I know you're right, But what can I do?""Speaker 2: How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night?""Speaker 2: How did you feel when you graduated?""Speaker 1: It was a round day for me. My family attend the graduation ceremony. I was so nervous. I couldn't find my cap and gown, But all worked out in the end.""Speaker 2: What did you do after graduation?""Speaker 1: I was planning to attend gradate school, But then I was offered a good job doing marketing, So I changed my mind.""Speaker 2: Sounds like you're happy with your decision.""Speaker 2: Come on. Tell me what happened.""Speaker 1: He married a girl who is only eighteen!""Speaker 2: Well, My family's away and I can't afford to do much. What about you?""Speaker 2: I can speak German quite well, But I can't speak French very well.""Speaker 1: Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now?""Speaker 2: Yes, But we shouldn't get any thing too big. Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture.""Speaker 1: That's right. Now this one looks alright? It's a detached or do you prefer this one? It's Sony.""Speaker 2: I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves. They only want it for their films.""Speaker 1: No way! They want publicity for themselves, So that they get invited to make more films, Go to lots of cocktail parties, And even make albums! They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for Drin.""Speaker 2: That's what I thought. It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months.""Speaker 1: Two months? How did you find out?""Speaker 2: I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang. I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark. She then asked if I was his sister, And I said no, I was his wife. She hung up immediately.""Speaker 1: So you asked him about the girl who called?""Speaker 2: Oh, You mean palm reading. I've seen that before, But I don't believe in it.""Speaker 1: Are you sure? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm. Do you want me to take a look at your hand?""Speaker 2: Really? You've read books about it? Ok, Then. But only if you want to.""Speaker 1: Ok, Let's see, Well, You've got a long life line, Which is good, And the love line is strong...""Speaker 2: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, And as you say, The score and songs performed by Elton John were great, The film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, It was too predictable.""Speaker 2: Professor Wood? I think he's a brilliant scientist.""Speaker 1: You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?""Speaker 2: My name is Jane Brown!""Speaker 2: Do you believe what they say?""Speaker 1: Who cares? It's just online. It's not real. Do you want to join me tonight?""Speaker 2: You are not serious?""Speaker 1: We had extra time of course.""Speaker 2: But why? Did I do anything wrong?""Speaker 1: No, We are just too different. This isn't working.""Speaker 2: Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.""Speaker 1: I have thought about it for a while. I think it's time to move on for both of us.""Speaker 2: But I still love you.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry.""Speaker 2: I knew this would happen some day...""Speaker 1: Then why didn't you talk to me?""Speaker 2: Yep. She's always got a bun in the oven. She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church.""Speaker 1: What about birth control pills? Don't they work on Italians?""Speaker 2: Ha-ha. Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family.""Speaker 2: My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise.""Speaker 1: True. The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities.""Speaker 2: The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole.""Speaker 1: Yeah, It's true. What is she going to do?""Speaker 2: Well, She is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community.""Speaker 1: That's not bad. It could be a short-term alternative. Your mum can look for another one when the market improves. Things will work out eventually.""Speaker 2: I just started, But the job market is very bad right now. I'm not optimistic about it.""Speaker 1: That's tough. What does your wife think about this?""Speaker 2: She's trying to be supportive, But I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well.""Speaker 1: I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job. I'll see what they can do.""Speaker 2: I really appreciate your help.""Speaker 2: Could you have gotten it done at another time?""Speaker 1: Yes, I could.""Speaker 2: You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up?""Speaker 1: I'll make it up early next week.""Speaker 2: That would work, But don't let it happen again.""Speaker 1: I'll try.""Speaker 2: The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel. There's a special one just for kids.""Speaker 1: So, We could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook. Then we could go to a club. We haven't been to one for ages.""Speaker 2: Oh, Hey, Did you look in the classified ads?""Speaker 1: You mean used car?""Speaker 2: No, Ah... Single sellers.""Speaker 1: Well, Yeah, But I'd be getting somebody else's problem.""Speaker 2: Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now.""Speaker 1: It's the same kind of deal though, You know, You never know what you're going to get.""Speaker 2: Oh, Hey, How about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I'm Brad.""Speaker 1: I'm Mary. I can't find my American literature class.""Speaker 2: What room is it?""Speaker 1: It's 112.""Speaker 2: It's on the first floor by the nurse's office.""Speaker 2: I am so sorry to hear that. Is that enough?""Speaker 1: It's so nice of you. You really make my day.""Speaker 2: Forget it! We seemingly need to gather money little by little.""Speaker 1: What you said is absolutely right. I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet.""Speaker 2: Do you have a plan to make up your missed work?""Speaker 1: No, But I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work.""Speaker 2: Are you going to go right away?""Speaker 1: I am leaving right now.""Speaker 2: All right, But please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up.""Speaker 1: Thanks, Professor. I'll make sure everything gets taken care of.""Speaker 2: How do you do? I'm Ted Nugent.""Speaker 1: Sorry, What was your last name again?""Speaker 2: It's Nugent, N-U-G-E-N-T, But just call me Ted.""Speaker 1: Ok, I'm Tom.""Speaker 2: Glad to meet you.""Speaker 1: And what do you do, Ted?""Speaker 2: Me? I'm in the car business.""Speaker 1: Salesman?""Speaker 2: Yes, That's right. And how about you?""Speaker 1: I work for American Airlines.""Speaker 2: Were there any animals in the forest?""Speaker 2: And now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart.""Speaker 1: Oh, So he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, Then?""Speaker 2: Right now he speaks mostly Chinese, And he can say a few English words. But he will learn.""Speaker 2: Who's playing?""Speaker 1: It's the Powell orchestra.""Speaker 2: Do you know what they are playing?""Speaker 1: They're doing a seventeenth-century program.""Speaker 2: And who is directing?""Speaker 2: Well it was 3 to 4, But Ripen's home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base.""Speaker 1: So Baltimore is winning?""Speaker 2: Right.""Speaker 1: This is a really great place to watch a baseball game.""Speaker 2: Yeah, There isn't a bad seat in the place.""Speaker 1: The fans are great here, Too. Not like in Philadelphia.""Speaker 2: It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game.""Speaker 2: In that case, I won't keep you. Remember to give me a call.""Speaker 2: Let's go to work. We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening.""Speaker 1: Let's string the lights first. Then we won't have to mess up the decorations.""Speaker 2: Hand me some globes and paper flowers, I'll put them on these top branches.""Speaker 1: There,... We're about done.""Speaker 2: Let's switch the lights on.""Speaker 1: Ok. Here goes.""Speaker 2: What day is that?""Speaker 1: It's Friday.""Speaker 2: Yes. She goes three times a week.""Speaker 1: Why? What does she want to be?""Speaker 2: She wants to be a manager.""Speaker 1: What classes does she take?""Speaker 2: Thank you.""Speaker 1: So, Wily, You have been with IBM for two years ready for change?""Speaker 2: I have no idea.""Speaker 1: Just in Beijing, People consume 300, 000 pieces of gum every day.""Speaker 2: That's amazing.""Speaker 1: If all the people spit out the gum like you, The whole world would become a big trash can.""Speaker 2: Come on, You are making too big deal out of this.""Speaker 1: I just want to remind you to behave yourself.""Speaker 2: I'm finished. What do you think?""Speaker 1: I like my hair so much.""Speaker 2: Do you really?""Speaker 1: It's beautiful.""Speaker 2: Well, Thank you very much.""Speaker 1: How much is it for my hair?""Speaker 2: You owe me $ 55.""Speaker 1: Thanks for everything.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry to hear it. What's wrong with her?""Speaker 1: Doctors aren't sure yet. But the real problem is Suzy. She has a bad cold, And we don't want to take her with us. But we don't know who can stay with her.""Speaker 2: You need a babysitter.""Speaker 1: Yes, I'd ask Jill, The girl I've had before, But I need someone overnight. Maybe even for two nights.""Speaker 2: I could have Suzy stay at my place.""Speaker 2: What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible?""Speaker 1: I'm sure there'll be canned! And there also might be some legal consequences.""Speaker 2: Why would the person who told have problems with the law?""Speaker 2: Would you like something to drink? I've got tea and some grape juice.""Speaker 1: Thanks. Some tea would be nice. Chinese tea is great. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it?""Speaker 2: Oh, There is a supermarket not far from here. But there is also a tea house around the corner, Where you can get tea, Taste tea and get a tea set as well.""Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I saw the tea house the other day. I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here.""Speaker 2: I don't really have one but I support Huston.""Speaker 1: Do they have a good team?""Speaker 2: I think they do, But I'm biased. They have a good manager and a great coach.""Speaker 1: I can't keep up with the game. The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing.""Speaker 2: I have the same problem. The players are really very skilful. I wish I could play that well.""Speaker 1: You play for an amateur team, Don't you?""Speaker 2: When poyou have to see her?""Speaker 2: The city is small, Not very modern, But there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city, So the air there is pretty fresh.""Speaker 1: Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort?""Speaker 2: Certainly! The most attractive place is that, It's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace. The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it.""Speaker 1: It sounds great, And is it really cool there?""Speaker 2: I won't, Mom.""Speaker 1: Take care of yourself.""Speaker 2: I will. Bye, Mom.""Speaker 2: If I had enough money, I'd buy one, But I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods.""Speaker 1: How big is a shuffle iPod?""Speaker 2: The first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first.""Speaker 1: How many gigs of music can it hold?""Speaker 2: I don't see it on the shelf.""Speaker 1: Did you check the computer?""Speaker 2: I already looked.""Speaker 1: Did it say anything?""Speaker 2: It said that the book is on the shelf, But it isn't.""Speaker 1: I'm sure I can get it from another library.""Speaker 2: Could you do that?""Speaker 1: I'll let you know when I get the book in.""Speaker 2: That sounds like fun. Where will it be?""Speaker 1: We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house.""Speaker 2: Oh good! Can I bring anything?""Speaker 1: We will be providing hot dogs, Hamburgers, And cake, But people can bring side dishes.""Speaker 2: I am assuming that the dress is casual.""Speaker 1: Dress casually and bring your bathing suit!""Speaker 2: I am not good at picking gifts. Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier?""Speaker 1: I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last.""Speaker 2: Yeah, That's nice.""Speaker 2: Several things, For example, Various coins, Stamps, Stones and so on.""Speaker 1: Stones? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones?""Speaker 2: Yes, Stones.""Speaker 2: Don't worry, I'll drive you.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much!""Speaker 2: How are your cases coming along?""Speaker 1: Very well, Thanks, I will probably finish next week, But this is still a lot of work, I have been worked on in for six months, And i'm so closed to end. I can feel it.""Speaker 2: Wow, Good for you. It sounds like a lot of work. I'm proud of you! Is this the right building?""Speaker 1: Yes, It's only eight forty. Thanks so much!""Speaker 2: I hope you like it. Oh, Have the other guys arrived?""Speaker 1: They're all waiting for you. Let's join them. I'm going to cut the cake soon.""Speaker 2: Help you in the kitchen, I don't feel like it.""Speaker 1: Would you like to clear the table then?""Speaker 2: Really? Do I have to do it?""Speaker 1: Not, If you don't want to.""Speaker 2: Well, Isn't there anything you want?""Speaker 1: Yes, I want to go out. Would you like to come?""Speaker 2: Yes, You are right. I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them. I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends.""Speaker 1: You did a good job. But I got tired of working in the garden.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well. I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day. In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected.""Speaker 2: What's in it?""Speaker 1: Have a guess.""Speaker 2: A necklace?""Speaker 1: No.""Speaker 2: I have no idea.""Speaker 1: Open it now.""Speaker 2: Oh, My god. A diamond brooch. It's so beautiful. You're so kind to me, A. Thank you!""Speaker 2: Oh, Give me a break! That place is too lavish for us.""Speaker 1: Easy. It's on me.""Speaker 2: It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves, But there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening.""Speaker 1: Like what?""Speaker 2: Well, We can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start.""Speaker 1: What else can we do to protect the environment?""Speaker 2: I'll get you for that comments, George.""Speaker 1: Just kidding, Mikel. Why don't you come work out with me?""Speaker 2: Ah, I don't know a fit works. Last time, All I saw the gym were bunch of lidos, Like me.""Speaker 1: It works if you keep at it. Come on, Let's go!""Speaker 2: All right. But so help me it's a better work.""Speaker 1: This feels great. I'm allreed up. I can keep going all night.""Speaker 2: It's me. I have studied make-up at a beauty shop.""Speaker 1: Can you teach me how to do make-up?""Speaker 2: Of course. First, Use eye shadow to heighten your eyes.""Speaker 1: What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me?""Speaker 2: I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls.""Speaker 1: How do you protect yourself from chapped lips?""Speaker 2: I suggest you use lipstick, Which also accentuates your lips.""Speaker 2: I think I'm in love.""Speaker 1: Are you? Who's the lucky girl?""Speaker 2: Her name is Jenny.""Speaker 1: How did you meet her?""Speaker 2: We are in the same math class. Our teacher sat us next to each other.""Speaker 1: What do you like best about her?""Speaker 2: She's very funny. She makes me laugh all the time.""Speaker 1: I guess it was fate working to bring you together.""Speaker 2: It must be fun. But you know, I am not good at chess. I never won since I've learnt to play chess.""Speaker 1: Don't worry, I will teach you how to win.""Speaker 2: Ok, Settled then.""Speaker 1: See you tomorrow.""Speaker 2: Do we get a day off from school then?""Speaker 2: I checked it out of the rental library. It only costs five cents a day.""Speaker 1: Is it really worth paying for?""Speaker 2: I can't tell yet. I haven't got beyond the first chapter.""Speaker 2: Yes, That was the first thing we did. We went all the way to the top. There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there.""Speaker 1: What else did you see?""Speaker 2: Art galleries, Cathedrals, Statues, Fountains, Palaces, Bistros, There's really too much to say.""Speaker 1: You must have had a great time.""Speaker 2: Yes, At the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun. However, On the third day of travelling in the city, I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening.""Speaker 1: Yes. You need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad. Sometimes new food might disagree with you.""Speaker 2: I was seventeen.""Speaker 1: So, Did you go to college right away?""Speaker 2: No, Because my English wasn't very good. I studied English for two years first.""Speaker 1: Wow, Your English is really fluent now.""Speaker 2: Thanks. Your English is pretty good, Too.""Speaker 2: Are there any good seats left?""Speaker 1: Sorry. There are only some seats in the back.""Speaker 2: Well, What time does it begin?""Speaker 1: It begins at 7 p.M ...""Speaker 2: Ok. I see.""Speaker 1: How many tickets do you want?""Speaker 2: Just two.""Speaker 1: Ok. Fifty yuan for each.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things.""Speaker 1: You are right. Let's stop idling around and do something.""Speaker 2: Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night. I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings.""Speaker 1: Well, You can simply tell them you want to sleep, Or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, But I find these sorts of things hard to say. They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV. Now I just hope the show will end soon.""Speaker 1: I understand. I used to live in a dorm with four people. I was great in some aspects. We always went out and and had fun together. But on the other hand, When I wanted some quiet time, And people kept.""Speaker 2: Oh, It's a pity that you have to leave.""Speaker 1: Thank you for a wonderful meal.""Speaker 2: Oh, My mother is a German, So I can speak German.""Speaker 1: Oh, Do you like Chinese?""Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm eager to learn Chinese, But it is too difficult for me.""Speaker 1: I want to study German. Can we exchange lessons?""Speaker 2: Very Good. I'd like to do that.""Speaker 1: When will we begin?""Speaker 2: How about tomorrow night?""Speaker 2: I really appreciated it.""Speaker 1: I was happy to help.""Speaker 2: It was so kind of you.""Speaker 1: Don't mention it.""Speaker 2: Yeah, Beautiful sunshine, Pleasant scenery and many new friends.""Speaker 2: I go as much as I can. I love hiking, Because you can really get in touch with nature.""Speaker 1: It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?""Speaker 2: Sure. But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?""Speaker 1: Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike.""Speaker 2: Wow. You must have been pretty far away from the city.""Speaker 2: The Bulls, Of course!""Speaker 1: What! That wasn't a foul! C 'mon, Ref!""Speaker 2: Don't worry, Shan always screws up free throws.""Speaker 1: You were right! He didn't make the shot!""Speaker 2: That was a great shot! A three pointer, Yeah!""Speaker 1: Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!""Speaker 2: This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, Open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!""Speaker 2: His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion.""Speaker 1: Poor Kevin, We should do something for him. He is a nice guy and does his job well.""Speaker 2: Mom, That's a stupid question.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: I am not a child at all. I know more.""Speaker 1: Oh, My son looks like a grown-up.""Speaker 2: Sure. Mom, I can take care of you.""Speaker 1: No kidding. So tell me what's your favorite color?""Speaker 2: I like blue. You see, That's the color of the sky. I wanna be a superman.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: I hope I can fly to any place like superman. So I can touch the sky.""Speaker 2: She sure can. Are you jealous, Leslie?""Speaker 1: A little, I wish I could do that.""Speaker 2: You can! With a little practice.""Speaker 1: Look at him, He's buff.""Speaker 2: I think he's hot too.""Speaker 1: How do they all get in suchtiptop shape?""Speaker 2: Exercised over and over. Exercise is a key.""Speaker 1: That's it. I decided to turn over a new leaf. I'm going to exercise every single day.""Speaker 2: It looks good on the outside, But the inside is a different story. It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again.""Speaker 1: What's wrong with it?""Speaker 2: Well, First of all, It needs a new engine, Which is extremely expensive.""Speaker 1: When's the last time you had it serviced?""Speaker 2: It must have been a few years ago now.""Speaker 1: I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.""Speaker 2: Shall we bring any thing? Some wine?""Speaker 2: Oh, Hi, Tom. How've you been?""Speaker 1: Just fine. I say. Aren't you busy tomorrow evening?""Speaker 2: Let me see. Uh-huh... No, I guess I'll be free.""Speaker 1: Well, Uh... Why notdine out together and go to the movies?""Speaker 2: Sounds like a good idea.""Speaker 1: Okay. I'll pick you up at 6:00.""Speaker 2: I know, Fresh fruit flavored is the best ever.""Speaker 1: What is your least favorite ice cream?""Speaker 2: I don't like peppermint ice cream.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I know what you mean.""Speaker 2: One time, I tried garlic ice cream.""Speaker 1: That could be interesting.""Speaker 2: I see. How long does it take you to reach the office every day?""Speaker 1: Well, About an hour or so.""Speaker 2: Wow, That's quite a long journey. Do you drive a car?""Speaker 1: No. I take public transportation. It's safer.""Speaker 2: You are right! But I get up a little late. That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle.""Speaker 2: I've seen photos of UFOs in America before, But they've all looked doctored up.""Speaker 1: Do you think that there's life on other planets?""Speaker 2: I think there must be.""Speaker 1: Why is that?""Speaker 2: I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world. The world is just far too big for that.""Speaker 1: Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us?""Speaker 2: Fine, Thank you. And you?""Speaker 2: Yesterday. I didn't even know it was coming. He just told me he found someone else.""Speaker 1: What a jerk. He doesn't deserve you.""Speaker 2: But it still hurts. I thought I loved him.""Speaker 1: He didn't treat you that well either. Maybe you don't want to hear this, But I think you can do better.""Speaker 2: Better or worse, It doesn't matter. I had a lot of feelings for him. I really liked him.""Speaker 1: It must be really painful. I remember when Josh and I broke up. I was crying for a week.""Speaker 2: Yeah.""Speaker 1: Why not send E-mail through the Internet?""Speaker 2: Is it convenient and cheap?""Speaker 1: Sure. You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet. In addition, You can make a phone call through the internet, Too.""Speaker 2: Really? I'm so glad to hear that. But I don't know how to get access to the Internet. Could you show me?""Speaker 1: No problem. I'll tell you.""Speaker 2: What? Are you kidding? I'm only 22 years old!""Speaker 1: Yes, I am kidding. But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits?""Speaker 2: Yes, I know. I have a disability. My hip was broken last year. And I can't walk well.""Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.""Speaker 2: It's alright. You didn't see me walk to the desk.""Speaker 1: Here is the application form. I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university.""Speaker 2: Spring.""Speaker 1: How about summer?""Speaker 2: I dislike it most.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: Because the hottest season is summer in a year.""Speaker 2: Is that type of plant found in this country?""Speaker 1: No, It isn't. It's a pity, Because I'd like to see it in action.""Speaker 2: So would I. What other unusual plants did they show?""Speaker 1: They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, When the insect collects the nectar, It also takes some pollen from one flower to another.""Speaker 2: Great! Who's the bridegroom?""Speaker 1: Tom, That lucky guy.""Speaker 2: The guy always hands the girls in a line. When did he propose?""Speaker 1: Last week, It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs. Whit's party last Monday as soon as he saw her.""Speaker 2: My gosh! How romantic! When's the big day?""Speaker 1: July 4, The National Holiday.""Speaker 2: Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony?""Speaker 1: Jenny plans to hold it in church.""Speaker 2: Well, It's very comfortable just to drift here.""Speaker 1: Have you thought about graduate school?""Speaker 2: No.""Speaker 1: Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?""Speaker 2: You got me.""Speaker 2: I know. I know!""Speaker 1: Do you think you can finish it on time?""Speaker 2: Don't worry. I'll get it done very soon. I'm almost finished.""Speaker 1: You'd better hurry!""Speaker 2: Well, It would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me.""Speaker 2: I know. Maybe we can finish it tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Why not! These orders are not urgent. We could do it first thing tomorrow morning.""Speaker 2: All right. Let's call it quits and go home.""Speaker 2: Well, Maybe so. But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion.""Speaker 2: Oh, You went to the wedding?""Speaker 1: No, He didn't tell me about it. Don't feel bad.""Speaker 2: That is true. I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities. First of all, You need official transcripts of your undergraduate work, Three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence, And the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ). Then you need a financial guarantee, And an application fee of 25 dollars.""Speaker 1: What's to come next?""Speaker 2: No way! I like my apartment, And I like to be independent.""Speaker 1: Do you ever get lonely living alone?""Speaker 2: Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time?""Speaker 1: Yes, There were no games in 1916, 1940 and 1944, Because of World War I and World War II.""Speaker 2: I see. Look, Do you know what that emblem means? I've seen it so many times, But I don't know what it stands for.""Speaker 2: And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year.""Speaker 1: Oh, Me too! All the family getting together...""Speaker 2: And I really like the smells and colors of spring.""Speaker 1: I like the feeling then that school is almost over!""Speaker 2: Oh, That's very sad.""Speaker 1: Yeah, She's broken up about it, Poor kid.""Speaker 2: What did you do?""Speaker 1: I talked to her for a while, But she's really depressed. So, I made an appointment with the school counselor for her.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. The counselor is a psychologist. He's better trained to handle these sorts of things.""Speaker 1: Yeah, That's what I told her. I'm glad she's reaching out for help, Instead of trying to deal with this on her own.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea.""Speaker 1: Well. What's the climate like in your country?""Speaker 2: It's mild. But it's not always pleasant.""Speaker 1: Which season do you like best?""Speaker 2: I'm not sure yet. And you?""Speaker 1: I would like to go skating. Feel like going with me?""Speaker 2: Is skating interesting?""Speaker 1: I think so. Fresh air, White snow. It's so comfortable.""Speaker 2: But I can't skate well.""Speaker 1: It doesn't matter, I can teach you.""Speaker 2: Yes, It's very interesting.""Speaker 1: Can you teach me?""Speaker 2: Sure. Take the tennis racket. Now, Throw the ball up, And hit it with the racket. Like this.""Speaker 1: Let me try. Oh, I missed!""Speaker 2: Throw the ball up high.""Speaker 1: High?""Speaker 2: Yes, Very high. Over your head. Then you will have time to hit the ball.""Speaker 1: Oh! I hit it.""Speaker 2: Well done!""Speaker 2: What a shame. Why didn't you take a sleeping pill?""Speaker 1: I don't like them. I used to take them when I had to work overtime, You know.""Speaker 2: How many did you use to take?""Speaker 2: It is the Colorado River. You can go down the river in a boat if you wish.""Speaker 1: No. Thank you. It looks a bit too dangerous for me.""Speaker 2: There is a beautiful state park here. I can see why so many people come out here to camp.""Speaker 1: Yes, There is beautiful view. You can go fishing, Camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air.""Speaker 2: It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city.""Speaker 2: I'm a little nervous!""Speaker 1: I think you'll like them. My family is pretty laid back.""Speaker 2: How Ay people will be there at dinner?""Speaker 1: Let's see. There's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters.""Speaker 2: I'm majoring in English.""Speaker 1: Is it difficult to learn?""Speaker 2: Yes. The language is hard to learn, But it's interesting.""Speaker 1: Do you know anything about Britain and America?""Speaker 2: I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture.""Speaker 1: Right. It's important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well.""Speaker 2: We're going to visit my sister in the city.""Speaker 1: I didn't know your sister lives in the city, When did she move there?""Speaker 2: About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, Across from the public library.""Speaker 1: I see. It's almost 5:00 PM now, Don't you think there will be a lot of traffic?""Speaker 2: Oh, We're not driving. We're going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes.""Speaker 1: Yes, But it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.""Speaker 2: It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories.""Speaker 1: I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around.""Speaker 2: It was fun for me, Too. It gave me a chance to get away from my routine.""Speaker 1: You'll be out to see me next year, As you promised?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. I should be there some time next spring.""Speaker 2: You certainly need that. You always pump the volume up way too high.""Speaker 1: I know. And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music.""Speaker 2: I'm all done now.""Speaker 1: Are you sure you're finished?""Speaker 2: I don't understand.""Speaker 1: You did a horrible job on my hair.""Speaker 2: What's wrong with it?""Speaker 1: I don't like anything about it.""Speaker 2: I apologize.""Speaker 1: That's fine, But I'm not paying for it.""Speaker 2: Oh yeah. It loses only a few seconds in the whole month.""Speaker 2: I think it's a very complicated issue. A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers. Don't underestimate the good ole 'boy system. Men have power, So it's easier for them to stay in power.""Speaker 2: All right, We are here at the eighth hole. It's a par four, And has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole!""Speaker 1: Tiger Woods is about to tee off, And let's see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, He seems to be very nervous.""Speaker 2: We don't know, But he's going to the doctor tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Let me know if there's anything I can do.""Speaker 2: Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?""Speaker 1: I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well.""Speaker 2: I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, But not so well in others.""Speaker 1: I think I could take better notes and read a little more.""Speaker 2: You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on.""Speaker 1: I'm working on it!""Speaker 2: Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit. The library card is free.""Speaker 1: Ok. Here is the money. And If I return the card, Can I get the refund?""Speaker 2: Of course, As long as the card is well kept.""Speaker 1: Ok. I see. Thank you.""Speaker 2: If I get the promotion, I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer.""Speaker 1: Will you get a pay-raise, Too?""Speaker 2: Whenever you are given added responsibilities, You should get a promotion.""Speaker 1: That makes sense. Who interviewed you?""Speaker 2: My boss.""Speaker 1: What kinds of questions did she ask you?""Speaker 2: The Bulls, Of course!""Speaker 1: What! That wasn't a foul! C 'mon, Ref!""Speaker 2: Don't worry, Shan always screws up free throws.""Speaker 1: You were right! He didn't make the shot!""Speaker 2: That was a great shot! A three pointer, Yeah!""Speaker 1: Did you see that? He traveled and the ref didn't call it!""Speaker 2: This ref needs glasses. Hey ref, Open your eyes! I can't believe he didn't see that!""Speaker 2: Reading my fashion magazines! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends?""Speaker 1: But they're just ads...""Speaker 2: Now that take this seat. Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage?""Speaker 1: Yes. I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves, All sorts of feelings welling up in my heart.""Speaker 2: That's true. Four years 'trails and hardships, Joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together. I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life.""Speaker 1: How time flies. Look, The president of the college has come onto the stage.""Speaker 2: Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Take it easy. It will be OK soon. You see, I take this long-hour plane frequently, But the jet lag still makes me uneasy.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Do you get a good knowledge of China?""Speaker 2: Yes, Whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most.""Speaker 2: Medicine. In my country, That certainly has great prestige.""Speaker 1: I see. Which subject did you put last then?""Speaker 2: Oh. History.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. Could you give any reasons for your choice? Can you explainwhy do you put medicine first?""Speaker 2: Well, Doctors are such an important job. I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got, Isn't it? I want to be important and help people.""Speaker 2: Have you got the ticket?""Speaker 1: Yes, I did.""Speaker 2: What time are you going?""Speaker 1: At 11:00 o'clock.""Speaker 2: I'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport.""Speaker 1: No, I'll go by myself, Thanks.""Speaker 2: What are they doing in Beijing?""Speaker 1: They are attending an international conference here.""Speaker 2: Which hotel are they staying at?""Speaker 2: Can you get it?""Speaker 2: From China.""Speaker 1: Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, If you don't mind me saying so.""Speaker 2: It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, Visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.""Speaker 1: Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, How old are you?""Speaker 2: Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?""Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Sir. What exactly is problem?""Speaker 1: Well, Easily, It doesn't work. It doesn't even start probably.""Speaker 2: I'd like to apologize for my carelessness. May I clean it up for you?""Speaker 1: No, I'll do it myself.""Speaker 2: Here is my card, Sir. Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you?""Speaker 1: I should think so, Too!""Speaker 2: I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble.""Speaker 1: Yes, And please be more careful in the future!""Speaker 2: I will, Sir. I'm really very sorry.""Speaker 2: Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people. Come on, Just tell me. Don't beat around the bush, Please!""Speaker 1: Well. Since you'd like an honest answer, I will tell you the truth.""Speaker 2: Alright. What is that you want to tell me?""Speaker 1: We'Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation!""Speaker 2: So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip?""Speaker 1: Yep! And take it with me anywhere! And the music is free!""Speaker 2: Some men do, But not me.""Speaker 1: I'm watching you.""Speaker 2: I'm an open book. Watch me all you want.""Speaker 1: If I catch you, You'll be sorry.""Speaker 2: You won't catch me, Because I love you. I'm not a cheater.""Speaker 1: I will poke your eyes out.""Speaker 2: I don't want any other woman.""Speaker 1: I will chop your toes off, One by one.""Speaker 2: I see your point, But if companies didn't spend money on advertising, No one would hear about their products. I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying. I don't like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying.""Speaker 1: I really hate receiving spam. I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway.""Speaker 2: Sure. Would it be alright if I brought a few friends?""Speaker 1: The more, The merrier!""Speaker 2: Will there be a lot of people there?""Speaker 1: I sure hope so. We've each invited about 10 people.""Speaker 2: Who else is going to be there?""Speaker 1: I'm inviting my friends from work, You, My sister, And a few friends from school.""Speaker 2: I know your sister. She's very nice.""Speaker 2: You saw a ghost? When?""Speaker 1: It was many years ago, When I was a little child. It was the middle of the night, And I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen. I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, When...""Speaker 2: So that's where you saw the ghost? In your house? What did it look like? Was it hideous?""Speaker 1: It was a big, Green thing that looked like a person. It was in the kitchen, And it slowly moved towards the stairs...""Speaker 2: Yes, He asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat.""Speaker 2: You are a woman after my own heart. I don't know many people who can handle spicy food. Are you sure you are up for hot pot?""Speaker 1: Sure. If I could, I would eat hot pot every day!""Speaker 2: Ok, You are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food, Aren't you?""Speaker 1: Well, Let's stop dragging our feet and find aSichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner!""Speaker 2: They have moved to some other places long time ago.""Speaker 1: Wow, This place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China.""Speaker 2: Yeah, A lot of changes have happened here.""Speaker 1: This street used to have few stores. But now, You can see supermarkets, Shopping malls and department stores everywhere.""Speaker 2: Yeah, They are my wife's heaven, But not mine. I always get lost in the supermarket.""Speaker 2: I just transferred from another school.""Speaker 1: What school did you transfer from?""Speaker 2: I came here from PCC.""Speaker 1: Do you like it here so far?""Speaker 2: I am really enjoying it here so far.""Speaker 1: Which is better, Here or PCC?""Speaker 2: I think PCC is a lot better than here.""Speaker 1: Why didn't you just stay at PCC?""Speaker 2: But why were you getting off work so late? The office close at six, Doesn't it?""Speaker 1: Yes, But there's a rush on at the moment, And my boss asked me to do some urgent letters.""Speaker 2: But didn't you tell him you had an appointment?""Speaker 1: Well, No. I thought I'd finish in about five minutes, And I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes. If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic, I wouldn't have been so late. I'm sorry.""Speaker 2: It beats me! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing.""Speaker 2: No, I forgot to buy some.""Speaker 1: Then we'll have to put up with it.""Speaker 2: We can cover ourselves with beer! That way if they bite us, They'll get drunk and fall asleep.""Speaker 1: That's without a doubt, The best idea you'Ve had! Let's do it!""Speaker 2: Well, I'm really worried about my grades. I didn't think this course would be so stressful.""Speaker 1: You're a good student. I'm sure you can do well. What you need to do is to relax.""Speaker 2: You're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time?""Speaker 1: Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress.""Speaker 2: Well, They're really beautiful people.""Speaker 1: I'll say, She is really stacked, Isn't she?""Speaker 2: Yeah, She is a neck-off for sure.""Speaker 1: And he looks like a typical jog.""Speaker 2: Anyway, That is not what I meant by beautiful.""Speaker 1: What did you mean?""Speaker 2: Well, I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1. 7.""Speaker 1: Ouch. You must be very disappointed.""Speaker 2: Well, It's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have.""Speaker 1: Why don't youre-take the class next year?""Speaker 2: That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. How did you do this semester?""Speaker 1: I didn't do that well either. I ended up with a 3. 2 this semester. That drops my total GPA to 3. 45.""Speaker 2: My GPA is pretty similar to yours. I have a 3. 1 now because of the stupid econ class.""Speaker 2: The summers are hotter. The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years. There have also been stronger winds.""Speaker 1: I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.""Speaker 2: I think you're right. Climate change naturally over time, But I think that human activities are speeding up the change. I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem.""Speaker 2: I'm done now. Do you like it?""Speaker 1: I absolutely love it.""Speaker 2: You really like it?""Speaker 1: Yes, I truly do.""Speaker 2: I'm glad you like it.""Speaker 1: How much do I owe you?""Speaker 2: It's going to be $ 55.""Speaker 1: Here you go, Thanks for everything.""Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it. I only visited a couple of cities, You know. But I had a great time.""Speaker 1: Well, Tell me. What are they like?""Speaker 2: Whatever... Smell! Perfume samples!""Speaker 1: Nice. Hey, I like the layout of this page...""Speaker 2: Stop producing cigarettes.""Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.""Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.""Speaker 1: How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet?""Speaker 2: Pretty well. I think the boss liked my ideas.""Speaker 1: Great, So what happens now?""Speaker 2: I see. Where are you now, Li?""Speaker 1: Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge.""Speaker 2: It's not far away from home, It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk, Can you walk here?""Speaker 1: I've thought of that, But what can I do with my car? If only I had taken a taxi!""Speaker 2: That's too bad, But don't worry. We'll put off dinner till one o'clock.""Speaker 2: The usual place. In front of the treasure house.""Speaker 1: And what should I wear?""Speaker 2: Your usual shirt and shoes.""Speaker 1: What are you going to wear?""Speaker 2: Nothing unusual, I'm afraid.""Speaker 1: Sheila, How about that fashionable blue dress?""Speaker 2: I know. However, Jazz always annoys me. I really don't enjoy music in a movie.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of movie do you like?""Speaker 2: Anything with a lot of action, I like thrillers and chillers.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see.""Speaker 2: What happened?""Speaker 1: Well, Three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person.""Speaker 2: Wow, So you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work!""Speaker 2: Where?""Speaker 1: I have spoken my mind, And can go anywhere now.""Speaker 2: I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion.""Speaker 2: Oh my lord. I haven't really started them.""Speaker 1: How could it be? They are due two weeks later.""Speaker 2: I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days.""Speaker 1: Kate, You know, I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more. But I'm so busy! How am I going to work and study? How do you do it? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time?""Speaker 2: To be honest with you, Jason, I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job. I'm always two steps behind. I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper. Say! Why don't you talk to your advisor? And let me know!""Speaker 2: It sounds like you've got a perfect plan.""Speaker 1: You could say so. I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise.""Speaker 2: It can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model.""Speaker 1: Yeah, The success stories of that company might be useful for me. And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company.""Speaker 2: Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something? He got arrested for that, Didn't he?""Speaker 1: He got arrested all right.""Speaker 2: If I remember, He got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison.""Speaker 1: Yup, That's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.""Speaker 2: I think the government fined him a small amount, And he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire.""Speaker 2: I've seen photos of UFOs in America before, But they've all looked doctored up.""Speaker 1: Do you think that there's life on other planets?""Speaker 2: I think there must be.""Speaker 1: Why is that?""Speaker 2: I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world. The world is just far too big for that.""Speaker 1: Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us?""Speaker 2: My field is electronic engineering. Which country do you think I should go?""Speaker 1: Were I in your position, I'd go to America.""Speaker 2: Which university should I apply to?""Speaker 1: There are many universities for you to choose from. Some famous universities such as Harvard, Yale, The University of Michigan, And Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study, But they are very competitive and expensive. Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper.""Speaker 2: I don't believe it. Jean is such a kind lady. How could she do this?""Speaker 1: Who knows? You can't judge a book by its cover.""Speaker 2: I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor.""Speaker 1: I have a headache. Is there anything I can buy without a prescription?""Speaker 2: Then you can buy Aspirin.""Speaker 1: I will take the Aspirin then. And have you a small first-aid kit?""Speaker 2: Yes, Here this is.""Speaker 1: I'll take it too.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea.""Speaker 1: Well, What's the climate like in your country?""Speaker 2: It's mild, But it's not always pleasant.""Speaker 1: Which season do you like best?""Speaker 2: I'm a guide. I take people on tours to countries in South America, Like Peru.""Speaker 1: That sounds interesting!""Speaker 2: Yes, It's a great job. I love it. And what do you do?""Speaker 1: I'm a student, And I have a part-time job, Too.""Speaker 2: Oh? Where do you work?""Speaker 1: In a fast-food restaurant.""Speaker 2: Which restaurant?""Speaker 2: You mean your friends. I think it's cruel.""Speaker 1: Yeah. But it's fun. Look at those two ugly old ladies... Or are they men?""Speaker 2: Hurry! Get a shot!... Hand it over!""Speaker 2: Yeah, I did. But my fiancee has an important project.""Speaker 1: That's really a shame. By the way, Who will be the bridesmaid?""Speaker 2: Julie's friend, Mary. And John will be the best man.""Speaker 2: I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm.""Speaker 1: You are a thief?""Speaker 2: No, No. I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now. Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others 'vegetables.""Speaker 1: You mean it is a still virtual game. Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again, And you take theirs as well, Right?""Speaker 2: You got what I meant. Perhaps, What I steal are not vegetables, But loneliness.""Speaker 2: So they're easy to remember.""Speaker 1: Yeah, How about your maths teacher?""Speaker 2: He's an old antique, Very serious.""Speaker 1: Bad luck, Anne.""Speaker 2: Hey! How about your history teacher?""Speaker 1: She's another antique.""Speaker 2: Sure our thing.""Speaker 1: I do wish your christmas and happy new year.""Speaker 2: Who is in this movie?""Speaker 2: Providence, Rhode Island. Do you know it?""Speaker 1: I am not sure, Where exactly is it?""Speaker 2: Well, Not so far from New York. So what about you? Did you grow up here?""Speaker 2: I'm majoring in French literature.""Speaker 1: Oh, Don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It's really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long.""Speaker 2: That's right. We got the assignment last week.""Speaker 1: When is it due?""Speaker 2: Next Monday.""Speaker 2: It is kind of strange though, To have snow in April, And so much of it.""Speaker 1: There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time, Don't you think?""Speaker 2: When you put it that way, I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever.""Speaker 1: This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken. I can't wait to use my new hoard.""Speaker 2: I major in Japanese.""Speaker 1: What do you think of the literature course.""Speaker 2: In Thailand.""Speaker 1: I must say I think that is very odd. Are you absolutely certain it was her?""Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, I am sure.""Speaker 1: Because I don't want any, Er, Do you understand? But you are quite sure, Are you?""Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I did. They're going to buy invoking?""Speaker 1: That's right. For seventy-five million. So how are you?""Speaker 2: I think so.""Speaker 1: So why not come and join us? Lee will come as well.""Speaker 2: We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared.""Speaker 1: Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members?""Speaker 2: Yes, I can do that this afternoon.""Speaker 1: Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations. Doesn't that seem logical?""Speaker 2: I have to work during the day, So I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings.""Speaker 1: What kind of course are you looking for?""Speaker 2: I need to improve my English.""Speaker 1: Do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class?""Speaker 2: I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me, So a group class would be fine.""Speaker 1: Have you ever considered taking one of our online courses?""Speaker 2: At least you know what American women generally like in a man.""Speaker 1: Believe it or not, I guess American women like a man in good shape, Which Chinese women may not care about so much. That's my honest opinion. I know you have been trying very hard.""Speaker 2: American men are naturally taller than Chinese men. So even if I exercise, There aren't many chances.""Speaker 2: Oh, Thank you. I am exhausted. Will you bring me a cup of tea?""Speaker 1: Okay, But I haven't prepare supper.""Speaker 2: So let's eat out.""Speaker 1: What do you want to eat?""Speaker 2: Noodles. How about you?""Speaker 2: Ridiculous! They haven't met! Maybe they're the same sex!""Speaker 1: Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos. He's called 'Beast'?""Speaker 2: How could you know?""Speaker 1: I watched the screen display!""Speaker 2: Do you know 'He' is Ms. Rebecca!""Speaker 1: It's typical Net Love, And a typical lesbians 'homosex! Ha!""Speaker 2: What would you suggest to see?""Speaker 2: I believe industry is making us wealthier.""Speaker 1: I don't believe that.""Speaker 2: And in my opinion, Medicine is making us healthier.""Speaker 1: I agree with you in the sense. But we're all more miserable than ever, Aren't we?""Speaker 2: I don't agree with you. I maintain that we're healthier, Wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago.""Speaker 2: She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating.""Speaker 1: Yes, Now many girls want to be independent, So it is a little popular, Especially among white collars.""Speaker 2: But I am still traditional, So I felt weird when she paid for herself.""Speaker 1: Forget about it!""Speaker 2: Are you satisfied with your girlfriend?""Speaker 2: I'll be very glad if you would help.""Speaker 1: I'd like to wish you every success in your new venture.""Speaker 2: Thank you. I wish I would.""Speaker 2: I have no idea. Tell me.""Speaker 1: In the kitchen, With his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show.""Speaker 2: What does he do there?""Speaker 2: Special effects? Baloney! That movie was made on a shoestring budget. They've been using trick photography like that for years.""Speaker 1: Okay. But you have to admit that it was an exciting story, Especially with that surprise ending.""Speaker 2: You should read the book. The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end.""Speaker 2: Actually, It is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around. And is has heavy fog for most of the time.""Speaker 1: Have people set foot on its peak?""Speaker 2: Well, You are flattering me. I wouldn't say I am a professional, But I did receive some training at school. My music teacher used to be a professional singer.""Speaker 1: Well, A good teacher makes good students.""Speaker 2: We can try to lower our cost of production then. We need a price that we can compete with, Something comparable with the competition.""Speaker 2: Oh, She likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class. She doesn't mind your making mistakes, Though.""Speaker 2: Yes. Is it OK with you?""Speaker 1: Is it important?""Speaker 2: Yes. Do you mind?""Speaker 1: You really have to?""Speaker 2: Yes. Will you let me?""Speaker 2: I see. I'd like to reserve a table for two.""Speaker 1: Yes, Sir. What time would you like your table, Sir?""Speaker 2: I'm not sure, Perhaps around 8 pm.""Speaker 1: Fine! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm, Sir. May I have your name, Please?""Speaker 2: Davis.""Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Davis.""Speaker 2: Oh, Any chance of a table by the window? My wife loves the bird's eye view. As it's her birthday, I want it to be a celebration.""Speaker 1: I see. We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything, Please be assured that we'll try our best, Mr. Davis. I hope you'll understand.""Speaker 2: Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself. Enjoy your life.""Speaker 1: I just can't help it. Oh, Look at Clive, He is really a big hit. They are definitely gonna win.""Speaker 2: It's only seven minutes into the game, Too early to cheer up.""Speaker 1: Come on, 18 points already, They are never gonna catch up.""Speaker 2: Who knows! It's a long game. Look! That was a really nice shot!""Speaker 2: We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks, But apart from that, Summers are dry. Thunderstorms make the air fresh again, So most people don't mind then.""Speaker 1: What are spring and autumn like?""Speaker 2: I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, The weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, Sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny and dry, But it's gradually gets colder as winter arrives. What are the seasons like in you city?""Speaker 1: Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, So our summertime is your wintertime, And vice versa. We get some rain in every season, But most is in winter. In winter, It sometimes gets cold, But our winters are usually quite mild. Summers are warm, But not hot. Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each. The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city.""Speaker 2: No, But parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in, So they certainly influence their kids 'personalities a lot.""Speaker 1: So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents.""Speaker 2: Maybe when they become teenagers, They want to be completely different to their parents.""Speaker 1: You might be right. I guess most parents want their kids to be like them, But kids today grow up in a different environment. You know, They know much more about the world from the internet, Newspapers, And tv.""Speaker 2: I never understand the meaning of those painting. They are too abstract for me. I didn't pay much attention in art class at school.""Speaker 1: Art isn't for everyone. I'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery. It's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture.""Speaker 2: I like sculpture, Especially that form ancient rome or Greece. What time are you thinking of going? I'd love to go with you.""Speaker 2: Cooking makes me feel relaxed. So, What are we cooking?""Speaker 1: Ok, Well, We're going to make a pan of lasagne, A salad, And some garlic bread. Here's the recipe. Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard?""Speaker 2: Sure. We should probably pre-heat the oven right away, Too.""Speaker 2: You're welcome. Maybe next time we'll come to see you.""Speaker 1: My wife and I will look forward to it.""Speaker 2: I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit. Oh, What's your flight number?""Speaker 1: Lt's Flight No. 302, Northwest Orient Airlines.""Speaker 2: They just announced the boarding call.""Speaker 2: Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced.""Speaker 1: I can understand. By the way, Is there anyway I can help?""Speaker 2: No, Not now. I have found a part-time job. So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's so great, Bless you! If you need me, I'll always be there.""Speaker 2: I have it right here.""Speaker 1: It seems you have late fees.""Speaker 2: Are you sure?""Speaker 1: Yes, I'm sure.""Speaker 2: How much?""Speaker 1: Your late fees come to $ 24. 50.""Speaker 2: I don't have that right now.""Speaker 1: You have to pay it off before you can check out more books.""Speaker 2: What do you want to do?""Speaker 1: I'm hungry. I'd like to eat something.""Speaker 2: Where do you want to go?""Speaker 1: I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant.""Speaker 2: What kind of Italian food do you like?""Speaker 1: I like spaghetti. Do you like spaghetti?""Speaker 2: They've completely slipped my mind.""Speaker 1: The couple with the dogs-think back.""Speaker 2: No, I don't recall a thing about them.""Speaker 1: Well, I've invited them for brunch.""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm going to take some university courses there.""Speaker 1: Sounds hard.""Speaker 2: Yes, But I think it's probably for the best.""Speaker 1: Won't you get lonely?""Speaker 2: Well, How about the Museum of Modern Art?""Speaker 1: No, I don't like museums. They're boring.""Speaker 2: Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building?""Speaker 2: Well, Please sing one that's not sad.""Speaker 2: Would you like tea or coffee?""Speaker 1: Coffee, Please.""Speaker 2: Here you are.""Speaker 1: Would you like to talk over a drink?""Speaker 2: That sounds good. How are you doing, Linda?""Speaker 1: Just fine. Are you busy now?""Speaker 2: No. I'm just killing time.""Speaker 1: Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow?""Speaker 2: A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it. If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face.""Speaker 2: But didn't you say that his Dad takes him under his wings?""Speaker 2: I'm not sure.""Speaker 1: You honestly have no idea?""Speaker 2: PCC is perfectly fine for me.""Speaker 1: You might as well stay here.""Speaker 2: That's not a bad idea.""Speaker 1: PCC is a wonderful institution.""Speaker 2: You have a point.""Speaker 1: So, What are you going to do?""Speaker 2: Professor Wood? I think he's a brilliant scientist.""Speaker 1: You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?""Speaker 2: But you're crazy about him?""Speaker 1: Yes, I am.""Speaker 2: Why don't you run off with him? What are you waiting for?""Speaker 1: I don't actually know him.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: I only know him through the... You are not gonna believe this.""Speaker 2: Oh, Let me guess. Through the internet?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: Dancing. The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us.""Speaker 1: Oh, How wonderful! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys.""Speaker 2: It's excellent.""Speaker 1: Thank you for your compliment. Won't you try this fish with white sauce? I'm rather round of it.""Speaker 2: It's delicious.""Speaker 1: What sort of western food do you like best?""Speaker 2: I like beefsteak very much. Have you tried Chinese dishes?""Speaker 2: Could I get back the sweater you borrowed?""Speaker 1: Sure. Oh, That reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?""Speaker 2: Of course. Suit yourself.""Speaker 1: Thanks. My name's Bill Peters, By the way.""Speaker 2: Hi, I'm Susan Jackson.""Speaker 1: Nice to meet you. And what do you do, Susan?""Speaker 2: I'm a student at UCLA.""Speaker 1: Oh, Are you? And what are you studying?""Speaker 2: Medicine.""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: Yes, I want to be a doctor one of these days. What about you?""Speaker 1: I'm an engineer, I work for Boeing. Say, Would you like a drink?""Speaker 2: I'm planning on living with my parents. Won't you?""Speaker 1: I couldn't even if I wanted to. My parents told me that if I went home, Then I'd have to find my own place.""Speaker 2: You mean they're kicking you out?""Speaker 1: Not really, They just don't want me living at home. My older sister did that, And she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, It got harder and harder for her to move out.""Speaker 2: Well, It's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with, But they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so.""Speaker 2: Sure. How about Monday?""Speaker 1: Hmm. I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday. I've got to fly to Chicago on business.""Speaker 2: Well unfortunately, I'm tied up on Tuesday. I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town, And I don't think there's any way I can get out of it. Are you free on Wednesday?""Speaker 1: Wednesday? Let me see. Hmm. Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday. Oh, Yes! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned, And it's essential that I keep it.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm learning how to use math in the business environment.""Speaker 1: What for?""Speaker 2: The job market is so competitive nowadays. I want to develop some useful skills.""Speaker 1: I really admire you for that. How is it going?""Speaker 2: She isMiao Li. She's come here to see her brother.""Speaker 1: Oh, It's so. She looks very lovely. Could you give me some else information on her?""Speaker 2: Ok. She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill.""Speaker 1: How do you think about her?""Speaker 2: She looks very beautiful. She is a nice girl.""Speaker 1: I'm wondering if she has boyfriend.""Speaker 2: No, She hasn't.""Speaker 2: When can I apply for it?""Speaker 1: You can apply right now.""Speaker 2: I'd like to do that.""Speaker 1: Fill this out, Please.""Speaker 2: What's next?""Speaker 1: I will need to take your passport picture.""Speaker 2: When will my passport be ready?""Speaker 1: It will take about three weeks.""Speaker 2: Is there anything else?""Speaker 1: Mr. : For those of you who don't have a calculator, Get one.""Speaker 2: We are allowed to use a calculator in class?""Speaker 2: Listen to the sound of nature! It's like music.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I agree. It makes you feel really good.""Speaker 2: What are those?""Speaker 1: Do you mean the red things? They are roses.""Speaker 2: I'm going to take more pictures today.""Speaker 2: Well, It is and it's not. The city of L. A. Is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected. There are people here from all over the country and all over world, Like New York. I've heard people say that in L. A., Everyone is from somewhere else. Tha's partly true. So, I've met all kinds of people here. What I'm realizing is that the picture of L. A. That's in movies only represents a small segment of the city.""Speaker 2: All you need is your student identification card to check out books.""Speaker 1: Yes. Here's my identification.""Speaker 2: That's all you need.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much. By the way, How many books am I allowed to check out?""Speaker 2: You can check out two books at a time. But you can't check out newspapers, Magazines and periodicals, They have to be read within library.""Speaker 1: How long can I keep the books?""Speaker 2: He certainly is. He is the Peckham in our collage.""Speaker 2: This next one is from Betty.""Speaker 1: A highchair and car seat! Wow Betty, Thank you so much! I really appreciate it!""Speaker 2: One more from Carla.""Speaker 2: Bill, You know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing. And skipping meals will not help you lose weight. In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals.""Speaker 1: I know you're right, But what can I do?""Speaker 2: How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night?""Speaker 2: No, I just watched Supergirl, And it began too late in the night. I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock.""Speaker 1: I don't like this program, Because there are too many constant arguments between the judges.""Speaker 2: The contestants are different. These girls perform in free styles.""Speaker 1: Do you have much time watching TV?""Speaker 2: I think less than 3 hours. This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs. Too many ads between the programs. I prefer listening to the radio.""Speaker 2: I see. But could you give me another piece of paper?""Speaker 1: Ok. Here you are. Anybody who wants help, Please come to me.""Speaker 2: I bought you a new one last year. Isn't it handsome?""Speaker 1: It is great. But Tom's bike is so much better than mine.""Speaker 2: Frankly, He is more well-behaved than you.""Speaker 1: Nothing of that sort!""Speaker 2: Why hasn't the bus come yet? Every morning we have to wait for so long.""Speaker 1: Mom, It's OK. I will buy a big car one day. It is faster than the bus.""Speaker 2: Really? I am looking forward to that. What about the traffic?""Speaker 2: Unfortunately, We do. Let's plan for something together for Wednesday. We can go right after work.""Speaker 1: That sounds good. Where do you want to play?""Speaker 2: We won't have much time, So let's play somewhere close to work.""Speaker 1: How about Bellevue? It's pretty close.""Speaker 2: How much does it cost over there?""Speaker 1: Twilight rates are 21 dollars.""Speaker 2: That's pretty good. Let's do it.""Speaker 2: That's too bad.""Speaker 1: Thank you for your hospitality.""Speaker 2: Thanks for coming.""Speaker 1: How about next time we meet at my place? And I'll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise.""Speaker 2: Great idea. I'm looking forward to it. See you then.""Speaker 2: Yes, Look over there. That's the Empire State Building. My book says it's 102 stories tall.""Speaker 1: It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned?""Speaker 2: You're right, But when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering.""Speaker 1: What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue?""Speaker 2: Quite a number. Actually every skyscraper has a history. A few blocks ahead we'll see St. Patrick's Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center. It's a landmark.""Speaker 2: I am! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses.""Speaker 1: Good! Me too! By the way. You didn't tell me what you are studying here.""Speaker 2: Didn't I? I'm doing business studies.""Speaker 1: Really? That's great. You hope to join a company after graduating?""Speaker 2: Maybe. My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born. We are living in Toronto. Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate. It's too soon to say really.""Speaker 1: What about your friend Zoe.""Speaker 2: I don't know. I know there are advantages to joining, But I'm not much into group stuff.""Speaker 1: The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group.""Speaker 2: I think I'm going to decline. I just prefer to do my own thing.""Speaker 1: Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school?""Speaker 2: I'm majoring in English.""Speaker 1: Is it difficult to learn?""Speaker 2: Yes. The language is hard to learn, But it's interesting.""Speaker 1: Do you know anything about Britain and America?""Speaker 2: I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture.""Speaker 1: Right. It's important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well.""Speaker 2: Not a lot, Actually. Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia. I may have to go to KL in a few weeks.""Speaker 1: That's great. When are you starting?""Speaker 2: Thank you for the invitation.""Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?""Speaker 2: We contact through email.""Speaker 1: Email is not always the best form. I think QQ is way better.""Speaker 2: Your words sound a bit reasonable. But don't forget the time difference.""Speaker 2: Yes. It was a friend's birthday party. We drank all kinds of things-beer, Wine and spirits. After midnight, We were even drinking cocktails!""Speaker 1: It's a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks. You should stick with one for the whole evening.""Speaker 2: I know, But it was a celebration, You Kwon? I don't think I'Ve see you drunk.""Speaker 1: I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints.""Speaker 2: Are you applying to study or work abroad?""Speaker 1: I want to study abroad.""Speaker 2: What do you want to study?""Speaker 1: I hope to study English literature.""Speaker 2: Have you got your visa yet?""Speaker 1: Not yet. I have an interview with the visa official today.""Speaker 2: I see. Is it your first interview?""Speaker 1: No, I've already been to here for three interviews.""Speaker 2: What happened?""Speaker 2: True-well, Do you have any forwards for me to send him?""Speaker 2: I suppose so. We're both friendly and easy-going.""Speaker 1: Is she as clever as you?""Speaker 2: No, She's not as clever as me.""Speaker 2: 27th day of the fourth month.""Speaker 1: By the way, Could you tell me when the film will begin?""Speaker 2: It will begin at five thirty.""Speaker 1: I am frigid I can't be there on time.""Speaker 2: You can see it tomorrow.""Speaker 1: I don't want to miss it today.""Speaker 2: See you.""Speaker 2: Okay...""Speaker 1: I'Ve been thinking, And well, I think we need to start seeing other people.""Speaker 2: What? Why? I mean, We'Ve had our ups and downs, And we have the occasional disagreement, But we're happy together, Aren't we?""Speaker 1: That's just it, I'm not happy anymore, Tim. It's not you, It's me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, And you are a great guy! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for!""Speaker 2: So, What are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?""Speaker 2: No. Really, What happened?""Speaker 1: Well, It was all a big mistake, Actually. He got home on Friday night really late, And apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients, So he was really drunk.""Speaker 2: Was he out with the guys from the bank?""Speaker 1: Yes, I think so.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah, They always get really drunk.""Speaker 1: Well, Anyway, He'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys, So he couldn't get in. He lives alone, You know.""Speaker 2: Not really. But it has puzzled me for a long time.""Speaker 1: What's the puzzle?""Speaker 2: My husband and I prefer to have no kids, But my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way.""Speaker 2: Yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night.""Speaker 1: Oh, Really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.""Speaker 2: Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays, Especially the ones where he only played a bit part.""Speaker 1: I see. I'm sure you'll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.""Speaker 2: Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday.""Speaker 1: Are you a member of his fan club?""Speaker 2: Yes, So do I. They have wines from all over the world. There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket. We ordered some Australian red wine, Which tasted delicious and wasn't expensive.""Speaker 1: Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage, But the don't do that at “ ginger's ”. What was included in the seafood buffet?""Speaker 2: Well, It's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language. That kind of gets on my nerves.""Speaker 2: Okay. Um... Can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top.""Speaker 1: Don't you worry, I'll take care of everything! Oh my god! I just love your curly hair! It's so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!""Speaker 2: Um... No.""Speaker 2: Really? I thought you hated shopping?""Speaker 1: I do, That's why you should appreciate this gift!""Speaker 2: Sure. That's really nice of you. Let's go in and try some things on.""Speaker 1: How about this red dress? I think it would really suit you.""Speaker 2: Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company.""Speaker 1: Really? I'm surprised.""Speaker 2: The summers are hotter. The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years. There have also been stronger winds.""Speaker 1: I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.""Speaker 2: I think you're right. Climate change naturally over time, But I think that human activities are speeding up the change. I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem.""Speaker 2: It's fashionable.""Speaker 1: Come on, You don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity.""Speaker 2: Mary, It's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun.""Speaker 1: How? By drinking?""Speaker 2: I've heard. She looks quite depressed.""Speaker 1: Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.""Speaker 2: I heard they were just married for 5 months.""Speaker 1: Yes, She said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things.""Speaker 2: Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden.""Speaker 1: You said it. You know, They fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.""Speaker 2: Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.""Speaker 2: No, I'm an art lover, So I think more of Bellini and Botticelli!""Speaker 1: Ah, Yes. The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body.""Speaker 2: Don't we all... Hey! Your cousin sells gift items?""Speaker 2: Don't be silly.""Speaker 1: I'm serious.""Speaker 2: Alright. Next time, We can try some other flavors.""Speaker 1: Certainly. The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good. It must be very delicious.""Speaker 2: I work very hard and that's it, You know, Practice makes perfect.""Speaker 1: Isn't there anything else?""Speaker 2: I have no idea.""Speaker 1: You must have a high IQ score.""Speaker 2: Well, Jerry, Let me tell you a secret.""Speaker 1: Go ahead.""Speaker 2: My IQ score is slightly above average.""Speaker 1: Seriously? But you are such a genius.""Speaker 2: Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure.""Speaker 2: Come on, Hugh! Tea is for wimps! Please, I need your help.""Speaker 1: If you want to be macho, Order a double shot of espresso.""Speaker 2: Just asking? But why is your face burning like mad? Ah-huh, Someone has a crush on Jenny, Doesn't he?""Speaker 1: Who has a crush?!""Speaker 2: Come on, Ted, Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.""Speaker 1: Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out.""Speaker 2: What're you so afraid of? Just tell her what you're feeling about her.""Speaker 1: I'd totally die if she turned me down.""Speaker 2: Cheers. You guys didn't drive, Did you?""Speaker 1: No, We walked. Why, Do you need us to carry some stuff home later?""Speaker 2: Any time will suit me.""Speaker 1: Are you doing anything tomorrow?""Speaker 2: I'm free tomorrow.""Speaker 1: I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock, Will it do?""Speaker 2: That sounds like a great idea!""Speaker 1: Would you be interested in joining me?""Speaker 2: Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving?""Speaker 1: I thought that we could leave around 8.""Speaker 2: That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara?""Speaker 1: That was part of my plan.""Speaker 2: I am flattered.""Speaker 1: It is real word.""Speaker 2: We haven't decided yet. There are a lot of things to sort out, You know.""Speaker 1: Are you having a big wedding?""Speaker 2: Yes, I've always dream of having a big wedding.""Speaker 1: But what do you say about that?""Speaker 2: I don't really enjoy big occasions, But I think I'll come round to the idea in the end, It only happens once in a lifetime.""Speaker 2: She's 18.""Speaker 1: She is tall?""Speaker 2: Yes, She is.""Speaker 1: And she is thin, Isn't she?""Speaker 2: Professor Wood? I think he's a brilliant scientist.""Speaker 1: You're got a point there. But do you think he's a little absent-minded?""Speaker 2: Unfortunately, Yes. It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of theSout.""Speaker 1: That certainly sounds like adreary Saturday.""Speaker 2: How did you like the movie?""Speaker 1: I thought it was pretty good.""Speaker 2: Really? I can't say I agree.""Speaker 1: You're kidding. The story and acting were outstanding.""Speaker 2: I guess I expected too much from the movie, So I was a bit disappointed.""Speaker 2: I'll take over for a while to give you a break.""Speaker 1: Sorry. This is a one-man job. I've got the grill just how I like it, And I've made up my own special sauce.""Speaker 2: Maybe it is. But it's out of fashion.""Speaker 1: What am I going to do?""Speaker 2: Well, Sure it is. Actually, I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago. I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day. Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day.""Speaker 1: You have made a big progress. Quitting smoking is not an easy job. But it will be rewarding in the long run.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your suggestion.""Speaker 2: Yes, She will. At the moment, The exchange rate is very favorable, So she should try to go as soon as possible, While it's cheaper.""Speaker 1: You're right. By the way, Did you hear that tom inherited some money recently?""Speaker 2: Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago.""Speaker 2: We did, But since she started her new job, All she does is hang out with her new friends from work.""Speaker 1: Can't you hang out with them, Too?""Speaker 2: I could, But all they ever talk about is work, So I always end up feeling left out.""Speaker 1: Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, So it's just the two of you.""Speaker 2: Why? You mean a lot to me.""Speaker 1: Why didn't you answer my question?""Speaker 2: What question?""Speaker 1: Do you love me? Come on, I'm eager to hear.""Speaker 2: You know that I care for you. I .. I'm proud of you.""Speaker 1: Don't cherish your words, Dear.""Speaker 2: Does it cost to use it?""Speaker 1: We do charge to use the machine.""Speaker 2: How much does it cost?""Speaker 1: We charge ten cents a copy.""Speaker 2: How many copies am I allowed to make?""Speaker 1: There is no limit to how many copies you can make.""Speaker 2: Would you mind showing me how to use it?""Speaker 1: Please read the instructions on the copier.""Speaker 2: Thank you, But I really want to relax myself. I'm very sorry.""Speaker 2: I think that we last saw each other two years ago.""Speaker 1: What have you been doing for the past two years?""Speaker 2: I have been going to graduate school at USC.""Speaker 1: What are you majoring in?""Speaker 2: I am studying international communications.""Speaker 1: You should easily be able to find a job with that major.""Speaker 2: That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, Except me. There are a few South Koreans, Several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, And one Russian.""Speaker 2: What kind of clients do you prefer?""Speaker 1: Smaller local companies. We specialize in trade & shipping industry.""Speaker 2: Not bad. It really is great to see you again. W here have you been?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: I'm a new student in the school. My name's John.""Speaker 2: Nice to meet you, John.""Speaker 2: Yeah. Even though the customs were brilliant, I didn't think it was as good as the first two. What did you think?""Speaker 1: I thought the special effects were amazing, But I got a bit confused. The plot was too complicated for me.""Speaker 2: Did you read the books before you watched the movies?""Speaker 1: No. Did you?""Speaker 2: Yes, I've read them many times. I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters.""Speaker 2: Well, Two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue.""Speaker 1: Sure, I think I know the place.""Speaker 2: Well, Anyway, I made a beeline over to their office, Had an interview with the manager, And was told to start work the next day.""Speaker 1: That's really great, Jill. So, What do you do there exactly?""Speaker 2: Hop in, I'll give you a ride.""Speaker 1: Ok. Boy, This looks expensive.""Speaker 2: Yeah, It costed a bundle, Alright?""Speaker 1: Wow, This thing can haul.""Speaker 2: Yeah, This sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned.""Speaker 1: I believe it. Hoo, This car corners like it's on rails.""Speaker 2: We are on the high way. Find the pound shade ...""Speaker 1: Wow, This car can really burn rubber.""Speaker 2: Ben, We're fifteen. What kind of job are you looking for?""Speaker 2: Hilda Harris husband, Henry had an accident on his way home from work.""Speaker 1: How awful! Was he hurt?""Speaker 2: Yes. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.""Speaker 1: How did it happen?""Speaker 2: His car was hit by an express train. It happened at the crossing just behind his house.""Speaker 1: How horrible!""Speaker 2: He's having an operation in the hospital now. Poor Hilda! You can imagine how unhappy she is.""Speaker 1: I hope he'll be all right.""Speaker 2: Yes. Here's a quarter. I flip it, You call it in the air.""Speaker 1: Heads.""Speaker 2: Sorry, It's tails. You lose.""Speaker 1: Oh, Well. So you get the bottom bunk. What about our stereos? It looks like we both brought our stereos. Probably we only have room for one.""Speaker 2: Your stereo is better than mine. Do you mind if we use yours?""Speaker 1: No, I don't mind. I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room.""Speaker 2: Actually, This is a kind of addiction called 'infomania' or 'information overload'.""Speaker 1: Addiction? Checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? No way!""Speaker 2: Yes, It is. Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day?""Speaker 2: Um. It's delicious.""Speaker 1: And do you like English food?""Speaker 2: I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, But you're always so negative.""Speaker 1: I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.""Speaker 2: Where should I sit?""Speaker 1: Mr. : Why don't you sit behind Brad?""Speaker 2: Who's Brad?""Speaker 1: Mr. : He's that guy in the blue shirt.""Speaker 2: When does the first period begin, By the way?""Speaker 2: Excuse me. I wonder see Dean Mr. Lee first. I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is?""Speaker 1: Certainly. Mr. Lee's office building at the south end of the campus, Just beside the library.""Speaker 2: Excuse me?""Speaker 1: Let me show you the way. Please follow me.""Speaker 2: Thank you very much. It's very kind of you.""Speaker 1: My pleasure.""Speaker 2: Certainly! I suppose you dance often.""Speaker 1: No, I don't often dance. Isn't this a wonderful party?""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm glad I have come.""Speaker 1: How do you like fox-trot?""Speaker 2: I like it very much.""Speaker 1: You dance beautifully.""Speaker 2: Thank you. It's lucky that I have got a good partner.""Speaker 2: A foot massage sounds like a great idea. They are very relaxing. I'd also like to have a mudpack on my face. It's supposed to help with your complexion.""Speaker 1: Good idea. We should also pedicures and manicures.""Speaker 2: This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour!""Speaker 1: I think it's a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally. Don't you agree?""Speaker 2: Oh, I agree. We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress.""Speaker 2: My sister did it. When did you get yours cut?""Speaker 1: Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.""Speaker 2: Well, It looks very nice.""Speaker 2: What kind of music is it?""Speaker 1: Pop. It's Maria Carey.""Speaker 2: When is it?""Speaker 1: At 8PM tomorrow night.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd like to go. Do you think we should have dinner first?""Speaker 1: Yes, That's a good idea.""Speaker 2: Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment.""Speaker 1: Oh, I think I know the place you mean. We ate there last month, Right?""Speaker 2: Ah... Hence the buns and condiments we bought. And this is Holly's potato salad.""Speaker 1: You can put stuff on the picnic table. Back to work. The grill is calling me...""Speaker 2: Okay... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six! And what about some appetizers?""Speaker 1: Sure! Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.""Speaker 2: Okay. That'll be 80 bucks.""Speaker 2: So what are you going to do? Take up an art class or something?""Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I'Ve decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, It's just that I'Ve been smoking since I was sixteen, And I think it's time to stop.""Speaker 2: I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing?""Speaker 2: Thank you for inviting me. Sounds lovely! I would like to come. Where is your new apartment?""Speaker 1: It is in the DX community, Room 306, No. 2 building. It is very easy to find. Just ask the guard at the entrance.""Speaker 2: Who else will come?""Speaker 2: For how many people?""Speaker 1: Ten.""Speaker 2: Western food or Chinese food?""Speaker 1: Chinese food.""Speaker 2: Do you want an expensive meal?""Speaker 1: No, Not too lavish.""Speaker 2: How much would you like to spend for each person?""Speaker 1: What is the usual thing here?""Speaker 2: Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate.""Speaker 1: Let's say sixty Yuan then.""Speaker 2: Ok.

He knows how to enjoy himself.""Speaker 1: Not always. But they like good meal.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: How can I go there to have a taste?""Speaker 2: Just asking? But why is your face burning like mad? Aha, Someone has a crush on Anny, Doesn't he?""Speaker 1: Who has a crush?""Speaker 2: Come on, Josh, Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, You've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you.""Speaker 1: I'd totally die if she turned me down.""Speaker 2: I checked it out of the rental library. It only costs five cents a day.""Speaker 1: Is it really worth paying for?""Speaker 2: I can't tell yet. I haven't got beyond the first chapter.""Speaker 2: Because... I don't know. But, Connie, You wouldn't do that, Would you?""Speaker 1: Darned right I would!""Speaker 2: Maybe make-up would be enough?""Speaker 1: Come on, Liz. Be open-minded! Look at my eyes, They are puffy. And my eye bags, They are dark and loose and full of lines and circles. I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings.""Speaker 2: But what would other people think?""Speaker 2: But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys.""Speaker 2: Why did you put it off until the last minute?""Speaker 1: I didn't mean to. Things just kept taking up all of my time.""Speaker 2: Maybe you got your plate too full this semester? You can change that next semester.""Speaker 1: I think I'd better. I have twenty four credits this time around. That might be a bit much.""Speaker 2: You are a real fan of extreme sports.""Speaker 2: I know. But your way doesn't touch my heart.""Speaker 1: Oh, God, Please tell me how.""Speaker 2: I can't tell you.""Speaker 1: Ok, I want you to be happy when we are together, And when you are sad, I would always stay with you.""Speaker 2: When I am angry and want to beat someone, You stand there and let me do what I want. Would you?""Speaker 1: Yes, I would. Thanks for being in my life.""Speaker 2: How dare you say that? What they do is just for our good.""Speaker 2: What's on these days?""Speaker 1: I think they're playing Lord of the Rings.""Speaker 2: That sounds pretty good. Let's watch that.""Speaker 1: Where should we meet?""Speaker 2: How about at the subway entrance.""Speaker 2: Can I bring my camera with me?""Speaker 1: Sure. Bring enough films, Please.""Speaker 2: Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.""Speaker 1: Yeah but, He is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, He always shuts down and brushes me off.""Speaker 2: Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, Anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.""Speaker 2: I'd appreciate that.""Speaker 1: Please use the phone.""Speaker 2: He has a fever.""Speaker 1: Is he getting better now?""Speaker 2: I have to work on Saturday all day! I really hate my job!""Speaker 1: Are you available on Sunday?""Speaker 2: Yes, That's my only day off until Thursday.""Speaker 1: Ok, Well, My friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday.

Which beach are you going to?""Speaker 2: I'am absolutely sure I'm right.""Speaker 1: I don't know. It looks a little wrong down.""Speaker 2: This is right. There is no doubt in my mind.""Speaker 1: You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here?""Speaker 2: This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that.""Speaker 1: When could we get together?""Speaker 2: I could easily give you some time tomorrow night.""Speaker 1: Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door?""Speaker 2: Yes, And could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?""Speaker 1: I'll come prepared.""Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't actually teach in the schools. I taught after school. I taught in English institutes.""Speaker 1: But you taught children, Yes?""Speaker 2: Yes. That's right. But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America. At least as far as studying is concerned. Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school.""Speaker 1: They actually study after school?""Speaker 2: Do you prefer brandy or ports.""Speaker 1: Port, Please.""Speaker 2: Excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor.""Speaker 1: The port is exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right?""Speaker 2: Yes. You always have a good nose for wines.""Speaker 1: Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.""Speaker 2: I'm always up for a drink. To tell you the truth, It's been quite stressful here too.""Speaker 1: I say we get drunk tonight. I don't want to think about all this stuff.""Speaker 2: But we have to work tomorrow.""Speaker 1: We won't stay out too late. I just need to forget about work.""Speaker 2: I see. I guess diapers and baby food are expensive. Bringing up children is not easy.""Speaker 1: My wife will be going back to work soon.""Speaker 2: You should have more money then.""Speaker 2: Why not? I'd love to do that.""Speaker 1: Here we go. There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art. ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art. ).""Speaker 2: Wow. Look at this. So delicate and beautiful. Did ancient Chinese people really wear them?""Speaker 1: Not really. They are just opera costumes. Do you like the embroidery?""Speaker 2: No, Not much. I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off.""Speaker 1: Really? You're an amazing bargain hunter! Next time there's a sale, Promise you'll let me tag along with you.""Speaker 2: Well, We drove through the valley on our way there in the morning. It was a magnificent sight!""Speaker 1: Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures?""Speaker 2: Sure, We wouldn't miss that for anything. After that, We took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, So we got there in less than an hour.""Speaker 1: You were lucky then.""Speaker 2: Yeah, We spent the whole morning under the tall trees. We had our picnic there, Too.""Speaker 1: What did you do after that?""Speaker 2: Well, When you have that, You can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find it?""Speaker 1: No, I don't know where the bookstore is.""Speaker 2: Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?""Speaker 1: Really? How can I do that?""Speaker 2: Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?""Speaker 1: No, I can't make it today.""Speaker 2: It's a prediction of your month, Based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in.

Have a nice day!""Speaker 2: Sorry, I had no intention.""Speaker 1: It's too late to say sorry now. Oh, What am I going to do?""Speaker 2: First, I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work.""Speaker 1: What did your boss say?""Speaker 2: He told me that if I showed up late one more time, He'd fire me. He's so mean!""Speaker 1: That's horrible. Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work?""Speaker 2: That was my second time. The first time, I was in a car accident.""Speaker 1: Is your boss Chinese?""Speaker 2: Nothing. I just feel very lonely in this city. I miss my family.""Speaker 1: Oh, I know. Sometimes I have the same feeling with you. But you'd better not be so emotional.""Speaker 2: Can you stay and accompany me for a while?""Speaker 1: Sure, No problem. You can call me any time you are alone from now on.""Speaker 2: Thank you so much. You are so sweet.""Speaker 2: There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.""Speaker 1: Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, But compared to many countries in other continents, It's not very l.""Speaker 2: Britain is half the size of france, But great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world.""Speaker 2: Just buy a cask of wine. Have you bought ice yet?""Speaker 1: No, Once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice. The cooler, The better.""Speaker 2: I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea. It's appetizing and tasty.""Speaker 2: Just fine. How is everything with you?""Speaker 1: Not bad. I finally bought a house. It's an old one, But built really solid. It is close to here. Do you want to come over for lunch?""Speaker 2: I'd like that, But I'm flying home this afternoon, And I told my parents I'd meet them at the airport for lunch.""Speaker 1: Ok, Next time you're here.""Speaker 2: James Cameron, Of course.""Speaker 1: Well, Did you know he was also the director of The Terminator?""Speaker 2: Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools?""Speaker 1: Well, Generally in the U.S. Each university has its own outstanding fields. But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th.""Speaker 2: Oh, No. It's already February 5th.""Speaker 1: So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year.""Speaker 2: How should I say it?""Speaker 1: I don't want to be like this. I think we should get step further.""Speaker 2: It has only been 6 months, Our relationship hasn't had a chance tomaturate. We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over.""Speaker 1: Like what?""Speaker 2: Yes, They do. I wish we Americans had a better train system.""Speaker 1: I know. Our train system is lousy. And besides, Americans love their cars too much.""Speaker 2: I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful. They never allowed the government to develop trains.""Speaker 2: Not really. But I like it in spring and fall. I don't like it in winter.""Speaker 1: Why?""Speaker 2: The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day.""Speaker 1: What about the weather in Boston?""Speaker 2: I lived there for three years.

It's very nice of you to say so.""Speaker 1: Not at all. This dress certainly shows your good taste.""Speaker 2: Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing.""Speaker 1: What kind of college is it?""Speaker 2: To be fair, Both the costumes and scenery are marvelous.""Speaker 1: Maybe you're right. But I really don't like it.""Speaker 2: Well, We'd better go to a musical comedy next time.

They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want.""Speaker 2: I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars.""Speaker 1: Did either one of them win an Oscar this year?""Speaker 2: What is it? Why did you buy a brick?""Speaker 1: There was a guy on the sidewalk. He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.

I don't. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it's a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, But usually I do it in the morning. In all, Getting dressed takes about half an hour, At which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I'll put my hair up, Butoften times I bloody it straight. And then, Because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That's another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.""Speaker 2: I'm RoseTeller. I think I'Ve seen you somewhere before?""Speaker 1: Ah, Yes. I remember now.

I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks, Especially \"Terminator.\".""Speaker 2: Haha, That's definitely a cheesy movie too. Did you watch it over and over again?""Speaker 2: That's cool. Care for a little quiz on that?""Speaker 1: No problem. I'm an 'Olympic expert'.""Speaker 2: Wow, You've talked the talk. Now it's time to walk the walk. Here we go.

Bye.""Speaker 2: Well, You can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan.""Speaker 1: It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week.""Speaker 2: He's just a distraction, Like a mosquito buzzing in my ear.

It's a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.""Speaker 1: You'Ve been wasting your time on this? I can't believe it! It doesn't even look fun or challenging!""Speaker 2: My laptop is on my bed. If you think it's so easy then get on line and try to beat me.""Speaker 2: It's a letter from UCLA about my acceptance.""Speaker 1: Read it!""Speaker 2: UCLA accepted me!""Speaker 1: Really?""Speaker 2: I'm not joking. I got accepted!""Speaker 1: I'm so happy for you!""Speaker 2: UCLA was my second choice, But I'm happy knowing I'Ve been accepted.""Speaker 1: I am really proud of you.""Speaker 2: Mmm... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead.""Speaker 1: Yes that might be a better idea.""Speaker 2: Maybe we'll meet some of the artists too.""Speaker 2: So, You're online eight hours a day.""Speaker 1: Yes, I like the job though. Sometimes, I help other people in the office if they're having trouble online.""Speaker 2: How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information?""Speaker 2: Can you tell me how it is done?""Speaker 1: If a customer is interested in some certain goods, He can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen, And then the customer can place an order online to the sales company.

All the things here make me happy, The mountain, The water, The grass, The birds, The sunshine...""Speaker 1: I think we should go out more frequently. The natural scenery can do us good.""Speaker 2: Yes, Everyone on the sales floor has to wear one. They're supposed to make us look more professional.""Speaker 1: They're not actually that bad. They could be worse. What do you think about it?""Speaker 2: I don't mind it, Actually. I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day.""Speaker 1: So are you enjoying your new job?""Speaker 2: It's much better than my old one. My new boss is great.""Speaker 1: How do you like working in sales?""Speaker 2: What was that?""Speaker 1: Relax, It was just a goat!""Speaker 2: And that?""Speaker 1: It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later.""Speaker 2: What was that?""Speaker 1: Honey, Seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax!""Speaker 2: Relax, That was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.""Speaker 2: All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times.""Speaker 1: How do you total our scores?""Speaker 2: The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework, Attendance, And quizzes are the rest.""Speaker 1: What if we are out sick?""Speaker 2: Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.""Speaker 1: How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?""Speaker 2: Is that type of plant found in this country?""Speaker 1: No, It isn't.

You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I'm dumb and uninteresting.""Speaker 1: Susan, Just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her. There is nothing for you to be jealous about. I like your company much better than Janet's.""Speaker 2: I envy her and also I hate her at the same time.""Speaker 2: I agree. People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence.""Speaker 1: Yeah. And that's so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational!""Speaker 2: Right. You can't blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes. They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes.""Speaker 2: I will.""Speaker 1: I'll be yours through endless time.""Speaker 2: I see. And I'll always be devoted to you.""Speaker 1: Thank you.

The poll data sound quite right. He is a good president.""Speaker 2: To be honest, I like most of them, Except for my Chinese teacher. She is quite young, But her class is too boring!""Speaker 1: That's too bad. Do you have any foreign teachers?""Speaker 2: Yes, My oral English teacher is an American. He is from a small town in California.""Speaker 1: What is he like?""Speaker 2: He is great. He always tells us not to study for exams, And to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing.""Speaker 1: Are you able to follow him?""Speaker 2: That is true. I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities. First of all, You need official transcripts of your undergraduate work, Three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence, And the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ). Then you need a financial guarantee, And an application fee of 25 dollars.""Speaker 1: What's to come next?""Speaker 2: That's correct.

The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case.""Speaker 1: How do you research your books?""Speaker 2: I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories.

Do you know how to use it?""Speaker 1: I am pretty sure how to use it, But can you remind me?""Speaker 2: Of course, Just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.""Speaker 1: I see.""Speaker 2: Yes, It helps me to relax.""Speaker 1: Do you have any hobbies?""Speaker 2: I like to paint..""Speaker 1: What kind of things do you paint?""Speaker 2: Mainly seascapes.""Speaker 1: What kinds of sports do you like?""Speaker 2: Not so well. To be honest with you, I broke up with Tom.""Speaker 2: I don't have one.""Speaker 1: Would you like to apply for one right now?""Speaker 2: That's fine.""Speaker 1: I'm going to need you to fill out the application.""Speaker 2: All right. All done.""Speaker 1: All right, Now please sign the back of the card.""Speaker 2: Okay. I'Ve signed it.""Speaker 1: That's all there is to it.""Speaker 2: Well, The cultural differences impressed me most.""Speaker 1: You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans?""Speaker 2: That's right, Quite different. One day one of my American friend looked pale, So I asked him whether he was sick or not. But he was reluctant to answer my question.""Speaker 1: That's weird.""Speaker 2: And what's more, When he told me he had caught a cold for several days, I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible.""Speaker 1: You really cared about your friend.""Speaker 2: Is that where you park?""Speaker 1: Yes, The car park is under constant video surveillance, So my car is quite safe. Please get in.""Speaker 2: Thank you. Where is your key?""Speaker 1: There's no need, I have keyless entry, And the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car. Now, We can look at the navigation system to find the best route home.""Speaker 2: That's amazing, It even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment.""Speaker 2: I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.""Speaker 1: It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?""Speaker 2: Sure. But, It will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?""Speaker 1: Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.""Speaker 2: Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.""Speaker 2: Yes. Is that so important?""Speaker 1: Frankly yes. We like to employ married people. By the way, Do you have any children?""Speaker 2: I have a friend. He is my best friend and he wants to learn English. He would pay about 100 yuan per hour. Are you interested?""Speaker 1: I don't know.""Speaker 2: So I take it you are not interested.""Speaker 1: No, Lucy. Don't get me wrong. I mean school will be open on Sept. 2nd, And I will have a very tight schedule by then.""Speaker 2: Don't worry. My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule.""Speaker 1: That will be fine. When can I see him?""Speaker 2: You are right. In China, 'round' is an auspicious word. The moon cakes are in round shape.""Speaker 2: All you need is your student identification card to check out books.""Speaker 1: Yes. Here's my identification.""Speaker 2: That's all you need.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much. By the way, How many books am I allowed to check out?""Speaker 2: You can check out two books at a time.

The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.""Speaker 1: Okay...""Speaker 2: I don't want to beat around the bush so I'm just gonna come out with it. We are going to have to let you go.""Speaker 1: What? Why? I mean... Just like that? I'm fired?""Speaker 2: I'm sorry but, To be honest, You are a terrible employee!""Speaker 2: You must be joking. Those two?""Speaker 1: Well, My dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth. David called me this morning.""Speaker 2: So when did all this happen?""Speaker 1: Last weekend, While they were on the Sik trip.""Speaker 2: Well, I believe it now, And when are they are getting married?""Speaker 1: Next June.""Speaker 2: ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor, They are so crazy.""Speaker 1: That's rock and roll with fast tempo.""Speaker 2: I like the slow dance. I am good at rumba and waltz.""Speaker 1: Take it easy. The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party.""Speaker 2: Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage.""Speaker 1: Do you promise?""Speaker 2: Of course.""Speaker 1: And Tom, You will help Johnny with his homework, Won't you?""Speaker 2: I'll see. I will if I can but I won't promise.""Speaker 1: But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you?""Speaker 2: Yes. But only if you ask me nicely.""Speaker 1: Tom, Darling. You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you? Please!""Speaker 2: It's true. But I can't show my abilities.""Speaker 1: Come on! Don't be silly!""Speaker 2: Your present job is something better. Why do you change?""Speaker 2: I had to move it, So that I can get my bike through.""Speaker 1: How dare you be so inconsiderate? That's wrong.""Speaker 2: I am awfully sorry. I didn't think you would mind so much.""Speaker 1: Never do that again.""Speaker 2: Yeah, She is so charming. I like her, Too.""Speaker 1: It's said that her new movie is going to come out.""Speaker 2: What's the movie about?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure.""Speaker 2: Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about?""Speaker 1: I already told you, Because Julia Roberts is in it. I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities.""Speaker 2: Two books at a time. Except magazines or journals, They have to be read within library.""Speaker 1: How long can I keep the books?""Speaker 2: For one month. If you can't return the books in time, You'll be fined. But if you renew them, You can keep them longer.""Speaker 1: I see. Now I want to check out two books on spoken English. Can you show me where I can find them?""Speaker 2: Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity. They come with a lot of inviting functions.""Speaker 1: Such as?""Speaker 2: They offer clearer and sharper images. Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses, A photo mode and fast-action mode.""Speaker 1: They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand.""Speaker 2: Neither am I. It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club.""Speaker 1: Oh, Come on. That's no reason to do something you're not interested in.""Speaker 2: Well... What are you interested in?""Speaker 1: How about the Classical Music Club?""Speaker 2: Joanna, Give me a break.""Speaker 2: Yeah, She is some kind of Superwoman, Isn't she?""Speaker 2: What's wrong with climate? Anyway, I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before. Can't people do something to stop it?""Speaker 2: I would also like to check out this magazine.""Speaker 1: I can't let you do that.""Speaker 2: Why is that?""Speaker 1: Our policy doesn't allow anyone to check out the magazines.""Speaker 2: What things am I allowed to check out?""Speaker 1: You are only allowed to check out books or videos.""Speaker 2: I really need to check out this magazine.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry, But that's our policy.""Speaker 2: Where is he going?""Speaker 1: He is going to Canada and to live with his son.""Speaker 2: What a pity!""Speaker 1: Why did you say that? It's a good thing for him to live with his son.""Speaker 2: I know that. But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour. You know I always appreciate Tom's company.""Speaker 2: I thought about going to my sister's. How about you?""Speaker 2: Great, I like the idea of trying some new food.""Speaker 1: Good for you. Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world.""Speaker 2: Yeah. It's been a couple of months since I saw you.""Speaker 1: What have you been up to?""Speaker 2: I just started working out.""Speaker 1: Really? Where do you work out at?""Speaker 2: I joined the Samsung Health Club last month.""Speaker 1: What do you mostly do during your workout?""Speaker 2: I concentrate mostly on my legs, Chest, Arms and stomach.""Speaker 1: I should start exercising more.""Speaker 2: It's hard work while exercising, But it is a great feeling when I get done.""Speaker 2: I don't mind that. But she disagrees with me about everything.""Speaker 1: You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself. You shouldn't affect her decision.""Speaker 2: But I just want to give her some tips.""Speaker 2: It's very thoughtful of you. Wow, It is so beautiful. Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas?""Speaker 2: Please come in.""Speaker 1: But you're busy, Aren't you?""Speaker 2: I was preparing my supper but I've finished now.""Speaker 1: I can leave the parcel with you, Can't I?""Speaker 2: Mr. Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you.""Speaker 1: I had to carry my backpack with me all day.""Speaker 2: Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow.""Speaker 1: Does it have a lock?""Speaker 2: You got drunk, And you were hilarious. Lighten up.""Speaker 1: That guy was definitely a Don.""Speaker 2: So now you can say you had a mafia experience. Ha-ha.""Speaker 1: Yeah. If I leave Little Italy alive...""Speaker 2: My grandfather did that too. He used the time to study instead.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. Go on!""Speaker 2: My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business. He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school.""Speaker 1: So he became a self-taught man?""Speaker 2: What is it about this job that appeals to you?""Speaker 1: I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved.""Speaker 2: Yes, You could be right. There is a lot to consider.""Speaker 1: I am also wondering about the pay.""Speaker 2: Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?""Speaker 1: I am thinking that might be the case.""Speaker 2: No problem. Call me when you get back.""Speaker 1: I should have some free time next week. Say, Next Wednesday evening?""Speaker 2: That's good for me, But do you think you'll be back by then? I'd really like to see you.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday.""Speaker 2: Nearly everything.""Speaker 1: You are full of boasts. I can examine you by question and answer. What is Hollywood? Where is it? What is the function of it?""Speaker 2: Too easy questions. Listen carefully. Hollywood is the movie capital of the world. It is located in southern California. Many films have been made there, And the kinds have changed often.""Speaker 1: Not bad. What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930's.""Speaker 2: Ye, I hope so. Well. Take it easy.""Speaker 2: Do you like sports, Janice?""Speaker 1: Oh, Yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. You know, We spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?""Speaker 1: Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, And the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband. I always feel good afterward.""Speaker 2: It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own.""Speaker 1: They see their independence as a kind of character strength.""Speaker 2: Okay.""Speaker 1: Pick up a wood and hold it like this, Interlocking your fingers.""Speaker 2: Ok.""Speaker 1: Position yourself, Swinging the club, Watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can.""Speaker 2: Hey!""Speaker 1: Not too bad. The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible.""Speaker 2: Well, To be frank, Yes, I do.""Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry. But this isn't a no-smoker, Is it? I mean would you mind if I smoke here?""Speaker 2: Actually it is. Perhaps you haven't noticed the sign.""Speaker 1: Sign? What's sign?""Speaker 2: There, On the window.""Speaker 1: Oh, Sorry. I didn't notice it. Sorry.""Speaker 2: Either they go to a public place such as a hotel, A restaurant, Or a club, Or to the home of the brid.""Speaker 1: They go to the home of the bride?""Speaker 2: Why do you ask?""Speaker 1: The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite.""Speaker 2: Of course. I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines.""Speaker 1: So what do you do with all the out-dated issues?""Speaker 2: Pretty good. Listen... Have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue?""Speaker 1: Do you mean The Bangkok?""Speaker 2: That's the one. A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night. How about coming with us?""Speaker 1: Sure, I'd love to.""Speaker 2: Great. I'll call and make reservations.""Speaker 1: Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me. Oh! I'm late! I have a class.""Speaker 2: All right. I'll call you tonight and tell you the time.""Speaker 2: That sounds great. Is it casual?""Speaker 1: Actually, We thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays.""Speaker 2: That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.""Speaker 1: Yes, We've invited four other couples, So it should be a good mix of people.""Speaker 2: That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?""Speaker 2: I'll beat him.""Speaker 2: Yes, I tried it and I quite liked it.""Speaker 1: Weren't you frightened?""Speaker 2: Sure. But I still liked it.""Speaker 1: Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself?""Speaker 2: No. Although motorcycle is nice, I'd like to buy a bicycle.""Speaker 1: But why? Since you like it so much.""Speaker 2: It includes a lot of useful words and phrases.""Speaker 2: Fine. Once you have it, You can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that is?""Speaker 1: Yes, I know where the bookstore is.""Speaker 2: Ok, So once you pass the gym, It's the first door on your left. Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there?""Speaker 1: No, I didn't know I could do that.""Speaker 2: You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be going there today?""Speaker 1: Yes, I am going today.""Speaker 2: No, Please don't do that. I'd just like to return it.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Miss, But I'm afraid we can't do that. You'll order something else instead. I'd love to suggest the steak, It's the special today, And quite tasty.""Speaker 2: Ok, Then please bring me the steak mediun-rare, Thank you.""Speaker 2: Take it easy! Let's go to the mall, Window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like.""Speaker 1: That's just it! I don't know what to get her! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small! I suck at getting presents for people.""Speaker 2: That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess peoples' likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like!""Speaker 2: Oh, Good! We can all get together again.""Speaker 1: I'm glad they're coming in August. Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game.""Speaker 2: And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park.""Speaker 1: Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England?""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. We all sat on the grass, And Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs.""Speaker 2: Well, Girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things. Actually, Do we still have a meeting this afternoon?""Speaker 2: Yes, We did. Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag, And finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms.""Speaker 1: Where did you go? You've got a beautiful tan.""Speaker 2: My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks, So we compromised and finally went to the seaside. I think vacation in summer is not good.""Speaker 2: No way! That's great! Then we'll still be together!""Speaker 1: Actually, I'm already working for WebTracker. Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth, So I figured, What the heck.""Speaker 2: No kidding! I can't believe this. You devil!""Speaker 2: I think money will make me happy.""Speaker 1: You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness.""Speaker 2: It will for me. Then I can do all the things I want to do.""Speaker 1: You'll get bored eventually.""Speaker 2: Then I can find something new to do. If I don't have to worry about money, Then I don't have to work.""Speaker 1: That's true, I guess. If I didn't have to work, I think I would be happy.""Speaker 2: You are right. Our company's Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking.""Speaker 1: I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.""Speaker 2: I am afraid I can't this afternoon. I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons.""Speaker 1: Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together.""Speaker 2: So?""Speaker 1: So I think I may fall in love with her.""Speaker 2: That sounds great. But how do you know that's a crush or a real love?""Speaker 1: Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love?""Speaker 2: That's a big question. Well, If you're in love, Maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all.""Speaker 1: That's what I do.""Speaker 2: There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.""Speaker 1: Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, But compared to many countries in other continents, It's not very large at all.""Speaker 2: Britain is half the size of france, But great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world.""Speaker 2: Oh yeah, That's one of my favorite flicks. I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever.""Speaker 2: Either way. I don't care.""Speaker 1: How about a snack after work?""Speaker 2: I couldn't careless.""Speaker 1: Would you rather stay home?""Speaker 2: Whatever you say.""Speaker 1: Are you really interested in doing something?""Speaker 2: Rather. I'm afraid I didn't do very well.""Speaker 1: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.""Speaker 2: That's because you did well.""Speaker 1: No, I wouldn't worry about you.""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 2: I like the mountain idea, But I am not so sure about the month of January.""Speaker 1: You know, Now that I think about it, You might be right.""Speaker 2: April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements.""Speaker 1: That is a good suggestion.""Speaker 2: We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.""Speaker 1: Yeah, That would let us know what would work best.""Speaker 2: He's buying me a handbag, And then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant.""Speaker 2: You aren't going to a strip club, Are you? I don't want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it's your friends party.""Speaker 1: Aw come on! It's just some innocent fun! You know how these things are! We are gonna play drinking games, Get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.""Speaker 2: Sure. I didn't know you like mysteries.""Speaker 2: A garage sale... That's where people check out cars, Right?""Speaker 1: What? Cars? Are you serious?""Speaker 2: Do you import any food items?""Speaker 2: You mean visit a factory?""Speaker 1: Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry.""Speaker 2: Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee?""Speaker 1: I'm not sure, But as far as I know, Most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour.""Speaker 2: Actually, I could you some help. Thank you so much.""Speaker 2: That's too bad.""Speaker 1: Then my son drove into a tree.""Speaker 2: I am sorry to hear that.""Speaker 1: The dog bit the delivery boy.""Speaker 2: What a pity!""Speaker 1: And a storm blew our roof away.""Speaker 2: No. I haven't had the pleasure.""Speaker 1: Mary, This is Mr. Wu, My new Chinese friend.""Speaker 2: How do you do, Mr. Wu? Welcome.""Speaker 1: How do you do?""Speaker 2: It's marvelous! The lawn looks like a green carpet, And the garden with so many lovely flowers.""Speaker 1: We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning.""Speaker 2: No wonder it smells fragrant.""Speaker 1: Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later.""Speaker 2: Yes, It is. Look at the little light! It blinks off and on.""Speaker 1: Jen, It's not alive... But it does look user-friendly.""Speaker 2: I would look so cool carrying this around!""Speaker 2: I major in Japanese.""Speaker 1: What do you think of the literature course?""Speaker 2: That's terrible. He speaks too fast. How can I catch his meaning?""Speaker 1: Again, As you see on your course outline, Grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test, Periodic quizzes, And classroom participation.""Speaker 2: Yes, She will. At the moment, The exchange rate is very favorable, So she should try to go as soon as possible, While it's cheaper.""Speaker 1: You're right. By the way, Did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently?""Speaker 2: Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago.""Speaker 2: It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers.""Speaker 1: Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute?""Speaker 2: 12.""Speaker 1: Three or four o'clock?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: I never stay out that late. That's too late.""Speaker 2: But why is it too late? It's Saturday night. You have nothing to do tomorrow. Why not stay out and drink with us?""Speaker 1: Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei, Sharon?""Speaker 2: Yes, I was. And I like living here. People know how to party here. In Taipei, Some people know how to party. But here, Everyone does.""Speaker 1: What is that they're doing on the couch?""Speaker 2: Yeah, Bob moved in last week. He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend.""Speaker 1: Oh? What's wrong with his girlfriend?""Speaker 2: She came over last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out. I tried to smile and be polite, But the whole time all I could think was \"what's wrong with your voice?\".""Speaker 1: Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to.""Speaker 2: Banker?""Speaker 1: Yes...""Speaker 2: Can I have my $ 200 please?""Speaker 2: Not bad.""Speaker 1: Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening. Would you like to come with me?""Speaker 2: Sure. Thank you very much.""Speaker 1: Then I'll pick you up at six thirty. Ok?""Speaker 2: Ok, See you.""Speaker 2: Which side are you on?""Speaker 1: It's hard to say, Because each team has my idols.""Speaker 2: Wow! Ac wins. It is a close shave, You know.""Speaker 1: I will never forget this match. The angle is so terrible and so correct.""Speaker 2: I think so too. I don't like him either. Well, Who do you like best?""Speaker 1: It might be the English teacher. What about you?""Speaker 2: Me, Too. She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her.""Speaker 1: She is a pretty good teacher! With her help I think I can make great progress in English.""Speaker 2: Yes. The scenery is so breathtaking.""Speaker 1: What is especially impressive?""Speaker 2: There are thousands of hot springs and fountains. The park is known for them.""Speaker 1: Is there a waterfall?""Speaker 2: Yes. The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon.""Speaker 1: What an attractive place! How can I get there?""Speaker 2: Cool!""Speaker 1: Ok, Each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, You set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, It can move one space diagonally.""Speaker 2: What about all these other pieces?""Speaker 1: See this one that looks like a tower? It's called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, It's a very important piece so it's best to not let your opponent capture it.""Speaker 2: Well, Yes. There are something wrong actually. Perhaps you can give me some advice.""Speaker 1: Of course if I can.""Speaker 2: Well, Last night when I returned from thetheatre I found I lost my wallet.""Speaker 1: Oh dear. That's terrible. What was in your wallet?""Speaker 2: Well, Some money of course, A vise, All my identity cards and some photos.""Speaker 1: Well, If I were you, I would go to the police station straight away and calling.""Speaker 2: We can go to a horror movie, And I'll hold your hand so you don't get scared.""Speaker 1: You mean... Like on a second date?""Speaker 2: Of course! Or are you still too scared!""Speaker 2: Yeah, I hope so. Well, Take it easy.""Speaker 2: I hope so.""Speaker 1: You must feel really worried right now. But you know your dad is a fighter.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I think my mom is the most worried. I'm basically worried about how she is doing.""Speaker 1: Where is she right now?""Speaker 2: She's in the hospital with my dad. I have to go back tonight.""Speaker 2: Because... Oh, All right. You win. Let's pay for them and go.""Speaker 2: Yes, She does. But she's working in Washington,D. C., Right now. Her job is top secret.""Speaker 1: Wow!! And what does your brother do?""Speaker 2: He's a painter. He's working in Argentina this month. He has an exhibition there.""Speaker 2: I was fired last week.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry to hear that.""Speaker 2: It doesn't matter.""Speaker 1: What's your plan now?""Speaker 2: After the tour I'll have a rest. And then go to find a new job.""Speaker 1: Best wishes for you.""Speaker 2: Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn't call you.""Speaker 1: Oh dear, That sounds terrible.""Speaker 2: It was! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt.""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: For killing time and making new friends.""Speaker 2: Don't you think it's too noisy here? The rock music! I can hardly bear it.""Speaker 1: Calm down! My little guy! You'll get used to that after you come here several times.""Speaker 2: Well, I'll try. Then what would you like to drink? It's on me.""Speaker 2: But you're crazy about him.""Speaker 1: Yes, I am.""Speaker 2: Why don't you run off with him? What are you waiting for?""Speaker 1: I don't actually know him.""Speaker 2: Really?""Speaker 1: I only know him through the... You are not gonna believe this.""Speaker 2: Oh, Let me guess. Through the internet?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: That's what I was thinking. I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you'd have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels.""Speaker 1: I think I'd go lonely if I do like that.""Speaker 2: And where would you get a cup of cappuccino?""Speaker 2: Usually, I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year.""Speaker 1: Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday?""Speaker 2: But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing.""Speaker 2: 10 in the morning?""Speaker 1: No, At night.""Speaker 2: Sorry, That's too late. I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM.""Speaker 1: Ok, How about 1:30 PM?""Speaker 2: No, That's too early. I'll still be at work then.""Speaker 1: How about 5:00 PM?""Speaker 2: That's fine.""Speaker 1: Ok, See you then.""Speaker 2: No I haven't. I haven't visited the Bund either. I'Ve always had too much work to do.""Speaker 1: So you haven't done much then, In Shanghai?""Speaker 2: Sure. I'd love to.""Speaker 1: Let's see. Have you been to a jazz club yet?""Speaker 2: Yes. I've already been to several clubs here.""Speaker 1: Ok. What about an evening riverboat tour?""Speaker 2: Uh, Actually, I've gone twice this week.""Speaker 1: So, What do you want to do?""Speaker 2: Well, I haven't been to the theater in a long time.""Speaker 1: Oh, Ok. I hear there's a terrific show at theSanger Theater.""Speaker 2: Well, I like all kinds of music, But he is one of my favorites. How about you?""Speaker 1: I like alternative music.""Speaker 2: Do you have a favorite band?""Speaker 1: To be honest, No. I'm always in search of new music to listen to.""Speaker 2: Do you often go to concerts?""Speaker 1: I usually go to see a live band about twice a month. What about you?""Speaker 2: I love going to live gigs. Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend?""Speaker 2: What style do you want?""Speaker 1: Can you make my hair short?""Speaker 2: Exactly how short do you want it?""Speaker 1: Make it a few inches long.""Speaker 2: Are you sure you want me to cut it that short?""Speaker 1: I've been thinking about this for a while now.""Speaker 2: Okay. I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want.""Speaker 1: I honestly want my hair that short.""Speaker 2: If you need any further information, Please don't hesitate to ask me.""Speaker 2: Thank you.""Speaker 1: And how's your brother?""Speaker 2: He is fine.""Speaker 1: He's going to be sent to Britain to study, Really?""Speaker 2: Yes. He's already got the passport and visa.""Speaker 1: Fantastic! Please send him my congratulations.""Speaker 2: Providence, Rhode Island. Do you know it?""Speaker 1: I am not sure, Where exactly is it?""Speaker 2: Well, Not so far from New York. So what about you? Did you grow up here?""Speaker 2: Yes, I am, But I think it's time for some plastic surgery I'm tired of these wrinkles andsagging skin. See?""Speaker 1: I don't see any wrinkles orsagging skin! You are stop beings ridiculous. Besides, I think that people who get Boto, Have facelifts, Or tummytucks look weird. It doesn't look natural.""Speaker 2: Whatever, I think I'm gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.""Speaker 1: I think you need to get brain surgery. I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery. You look amazing.""Speaker 2: I don't know. You have to be smart, But you have to be lucky too. Some games are all luck. With some, You need to be smart.""Speaker 1: I want games that are all luck.""Speaker 2: I knew you would say that! Then you should play the slot machines.""Speaker 1: Slot machines? No, I don't want that! That's too boring. I want a game with cards or dice.""Speaker 2: So what do you want to play then?""Speaker 2: Only sometimes when I think about it, I feel very sad.""Speaker 2: Do you like sports, Janice?""Speaker 1: Oh, Yes. I like to exercise. But I don't watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don't have much time to do those things.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. You know, We spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising?""Speaker 1: Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, And the other days I play badminton with my husband. I always feel good afterward.""Speaker 2: Do I have to pay to use the machine?""Speaker 1: Yes, You will have to pay to use it.""Speaker 2: How much?""Speaker 1: It costs ten cents a copy.""Speaker 2: Am I limited to a certain number of copies?""Speaker 1: You can copy as much as you'd like.""Speaker 2: Could you show me how to use the copier?""Speaker 1: The instructions for the copier are posted on it.""Speaker 2: I love you, Too.""Speaker 1: How about a dinner tonight? My treat.""Speaker 2: Actually, I prefer to eat at home, And then we'll have more time to have a chat.""Speaker 2: Yes, The sun shines day after day. It's neither too hot nor too cold.""Speaker 1: I wonder how long this weather can last.""Speaker 2: Are you Chinese?""Speaker 1: Yes, I am. I am from Taiwan. I came here to study political science.""Speaker 2: How do you like it?""Speaker 1: I like it so far. But my English still needs work.""Speaker 2: I want to study Mandarin and international relations.""Speaker 1: Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters?""Speaker 2: They teach regular characters.""Speaker 2: Well, You are a very hard-worker.""Speaker 1: I try very hard. The problem is, My salary just isn't enough to live on. Now that I have a wife and a child to support, We hardly have enough money for food and rent.""Speaker 2: There are trying times for everyone. What do you propose?""Speaker 1: I could really use a 5 % rise.""Speaker 2: Me too. Do you think they are going to get the championship this time?""Speaker 2: We may travel by sea. It's cheaper.""Speaker 2: Congratulations. How lucky you are!""Speaker 1: Thank you. I'm leaving tomorrow morning.""Speaker 2: I'm sure you'll enjoy the trip. China is such a beautiful country.""Speaker 1: I'm sure I will.""Speaker 2: Have a nice journey, Lily.""Speaker 2: Well, I hope the client feels the same way!""Speaker 2: Oh, Without doubt. When is the next class?""Speaker 1: Tomorrow morning. Try it.""Speaker 2: No problem.""Speaker 1: Are you going to this class this morning?""Speaker 2: Of course, Easy. No sweat.""Speaker 1: You're no able to move after this class.""Speaker 2: Are you kidding me? It's going to be up a piece of cake.""Speaker 1: You want to bet?""Speaker 2: Yeah, What't the bet?""Speaker 2: What a lovely dog! How did you know I love things like this?""Speaker 1: I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.""Speaker 2: Maybe you won't believe this, But it was made by my grandmother.""Speaker 1: Really? It looks so nice.""Speaker 2: Thank you, Please have a cup of tea.""Speaker 1: All right.""Speaker 2: How about some fish?""Speaker 2: You didn't have to do that!""Speaker 2: My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek.""Speaker 1: Are you sure?""Speaker 2: Of course I am. I only love you, Amy.""Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry. I believe you.""Speaker 2: Why do you always accuse me like that?""Speaker 1: Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much! I guess I just go crazy sometimes. That's all.""Speaker 2: That's right.""Speaker 1: Would you like to have dinner with me?""Speaker 2: Oh, That would be lovely. Shall we say seven o 'clock?""Speaker 2: No, I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean, If I look back on your previous presentations, This is a huge improvement.""Speaker 1: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on PowerPoint.""Speaker 2: And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions.""Speaker 2: Jay Chou's title song in his new album.""Speaker 1: What's your comment on his new album?""Speaker 2: Gorgeous! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles. I am crazy for it, So I hear it over and again. And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile.""Speaker 1: Let me enjoy it.""Speaker 2: I suppose this song can be the No. 1 on the top chart.""Speaker 2: That's because regular buses don't stop here.""Speaker 1: How much is it going to cost?""Speaker 2: Nothing. It's free.""Speaker 1: Is that yellow bus it?""Speaker 2: A little, But not very well.""Speaker 1: How long have you been here?""Speaker 2: 2 months.""Speaker 1: What do you do for work?""Speaker 2: I'm a student. How about you?""Speaker 2: Thank you. Do you want your money back?""Speaker 1: No, Can I exchange it for a bigger one?""Speaker 2: I am afraid this is the biggest size we have.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad.""Speaker 2: I had to go by myself, He couldn't make it.""Speaker 1: What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, He said he was coming.""Speaker 2: Kitty's? He sure gets around, Doesn't he?""Speaker 1: Looks like it. So how did he handle it to?""Speaker 2: His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again.""Speaker 1: I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.""Speaker 2: I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy.""Speaker 2: Yes, We do. It is an exciting moment.""Speaker 1: What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving?""Speaker 2: Sorry. I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape. I like totally drew a blank on everything!""Speaker 1: Well, Now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it... What's-her-face... The one who always kisses up to the teacher.""Speaker 2: Jennifer Davies? Give me a break! I can't stand her. She's such adweeb! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time?""Speaker 1: She's the teacher's pet, That's why. Besides, He's so laid back he lets her get away with it. She just really rubs me the wrong way. And you know what? I think she's got the hots for him, Too.""Speaker 2: I can take a break at lunch time, But it is only 30 minutes.""Speaker 1: I see you sometimes work on weekends, Too.""Speaker 1: Really? What happened?""Speaker 2: It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, And we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, Said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee.""Speaker 1: That's pretty harsh.""Speaker 2: Well, I exercise a lot. I go running at least three times a week. But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained.""Speaker 1: Yeah, Well, Actually, One of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot.""Speaker 2: Do ya?""Speaker 2: I am going to miss you, Too.""Speaker 1: Let's keep in touch.""Speaker 2: Yeah, They can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot.""Speaker 1: Honey, How about taking them to the beach this weekend?""Speaker 2: That's great!""Speaker 1: Since last time we've climbed the mountain, We haven't gone out for a long time.""Speaker 2: And this kind of weather is rare for the season either.""Speaker 1: Yes, I remember last year this time, The weather is so hot.""Speaker 2: So we must seize this chance to go the beach.""Speaker 2: Yes, But I am out of food and milk.""Speaker 1: What store do you shop at?""Speaker 2: The small one, Just down the street. I like their generic brand.""Speaker 1: I have been using the store across town for years.""Speaker 2: I hear they have very nice stuff.""Speaker 1: They do, But they're a little expensive on certain items.""Speaker 2: Well, You should try my store. The prices are good.""Speaker 2: I will find one myself, Of course. I'm a modern girl.""Speaker 1: Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, The latest type.""Speaker 2: You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea.""Speaker 1: No, There is an updated version, Three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, You can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes.""Speaker 2: Quite good except thinking of you so much.""Speaker 1: So do I. You are a beautiful flower in my mind.""Speaker 2: Actually, More and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers.""Speaker 1: They are especially harmful to teenagers.""Speaker 2: Nice to see you too. It's been a long time.""Speaker 1: How is everything?""Speaker 2: Just fine, And you?""Speaker 1: Quite well, Thank you.""Speaker 2: Did you drive yourself to the airport?""Speaker 1: No, I was driven by my husband.""Speaker 2: Did someone meet you at the airport here?""Speaker 1: Yes, Thanks.""Speaker 2: Is this where we'll be holding the meeting?""Speaker 2: The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five.""Speaker 1: True. Ok. Let's see it this Saturday.""Speaker 2: How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00, And then go see the movie afterwards.""Speaker 2: I'd like to, But I'm not sure if I can. Work has been really busy lately. Why don't we go on Friday instead?""Speaker 1: Friday's not good. I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work.""Speaker 2: Ok, Then let's try to go this weekend. I should know if I can go by Friday. Is it OK if I call you then?""Speaker 1: Yeah, That's fine.""Speaker 2: I'm sorry, But it's a bad movie. The plot is stupid, And the script is poorly written.""Speaker 1: Face it, You don't like action movies because you're a snob.""Speaker 2: But why? Did I do anything wrong?""Speaker 1: No, We are just too different. This relationship isn't going anywhere.""Speaker 2: Hey, Come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things.""Speaker 1: I have thought about it for a long time. I think it's time to move on for both of us.""Speaker 2: But I still love you.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry.""Speaker 2: I knew this would happen some day...""Speaker 1: Then why didn't you talk to me?""Speaker 2: I'm going to my parents 'house for my father's birthday.""Speaker 1: How old is he today?""Speaker 2: It's his 50th birthday.""Speaker 1: Well, Wish him a happy birthday for me.""Speaker 2: Sure thing. What are your plans for the evening?""Speaker 1: I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight.""Speaker 2: Well, If you can wait until tomorrow night, I'll go with you then.""Speaker 1: Sorry, I've got people coming over tomorrow night.""Speaker 2: I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form, Please.""Speaker 1: Ok, The form is all filled out.""Speaker 2: Perfect! Do you know the hours and rules for the library?""Speaker 1: No, I have no idea what they are.""Speaker 2: Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.""Speaker 1: Yes, Right.""Speaker 2: Me too. Do you think we are boring people?""Speaker 1: I don't think we are boring. It's just that we don't have any hobbies.""Speaker 2: That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby?""Speaker 1: That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, So I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.""Speaker 2: I like to play the piano for fun.""Speaker 2: You told Martha that I was on a date? What was that all about?""Speaker 1: No... That's not what I meant. I didn't mean that. She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara. I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends.""Speaker 2: She started feeling suspicious after you said that.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry man. I didn't know. I didn't mean to screw anything up.""Speaker 2: Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend. Now, I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you.""Speaker 2: I suppose I could.""Speaker 1: Come on, Let's try it.""Speaker 2: Sure. You've given a great help to me in the past days.""Speaker 1: It's my pleasure. We hope you'll visit Beijing again.""Speaker 2: Certainly. I'll be glad to.""Speaker 1: It's almost time to get aboard.""Speaker 2: Yes, We should go. Thank you very much. Goodbye!""Speaker 2: Fine. You can either park in the student lot or on the street. Do you know what a handicapped space is?""Speaker 1: Yes, I have seen those spots.""Speaker 2: Well, When you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, Do not park there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening?""Speaker 1: I park in the evenings.""Speaker 2: Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs?""Speaker 2: Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons?""Speaker 1: Of course there is. Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can.""Speaker 2: I love flowers, You know. Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: What are you doing here?""Speaker 1: We're watching a football match. What's the matter?""Speaker 2: Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep.""Speaker 1: I'm sorry about this.""Speaker 2: Please turn down the TV. And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration.""Speaker 2: Fine.""Speaker 1: Ok, First of all, Can you turn the key in the ignition?""Speaker 2: Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.""Speaker 1: Those are possible problems, But tell me, When you turn the key, Do you hear the starter motor crank?""Speaker 2: Yeah, It sounds like it usually does when I start the car, But nothing else happens. The engine won't start. Should I maybe press the accelerator?""Speaker 1: No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.""Speaker 2: We won the men's high jump and the women's 1500 meters.""Speaker 1: That's great. Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition. They must be terribly disappointed if they don't win.""Speaker 2: The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds.""Speaker 2: Good question. I have to think about it.""Speaker 1: My husband is betting on France.""Speaker 2: France? Is he crazy?""Speaker 1: What do you mean?""Speaker 2: Ok, I will. You have said that many times.""Speaker 1: Are you hungry? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat?""Speaker 2: Just a few years ago. What about you?""Speaker 1: I just graduated from high school.""Speaker 2: Are you planning on going to university?""Speaker 1: I'd like to get a BA, But I don't know where I should go.""Speaker 2: Have you applied anywhere yet?""Speaker 1: Yes, I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them.""Speaker 2: Congratulations! Which one is the cheapest?""Speaker 2: Sorry, I don't know. I'm a passengers'm waiting for my train ...""Speaker 1: Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while?""Speaker 2: Certainly not. Here it is.""Speaker 2: What's the matter?""Speaker 1: This machine is out of order.""Speaker 2: You shouldn't have used the machine. Did you lose your money?""Speaker 1: I sure did.""Speaker 2: Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term, Rather than the long term. It's the same with the destruction of the rainforests. Countries and companies just want the wood. They're not thinking a.""Speaker 1: In other parts of the world, Especially in Africa, There is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert. In means that people cannot grow e.""Speaker 2: Would you like something to drink? I've got tea and some grape juice.""Speaker 1: Thanks. Some tea would be nice. Chinese tea is great. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it?""Speaker 2: Oh, There is a supermarket not far from here. But there is also a tea house around the corner, Where you can get tea and a tea set as well.""Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I saw the tea house the other day. I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here.""Speaker 2: Don't you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn't be so bad...""Speaker 1: You're missing the point. It's about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, As if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It's his attitude that needs to be changed, Not just his words.""Speaker 2: Her lips? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy.""Speaker 1: And her voice like a lark's song?""Speaker 2: Deeper, Softer, None of your twittering larks. I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song.""Speaker 1: Oh, She sings too?""Speaker 2: Fantastic! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds!""Speaker 1: What other activities will you have tomorrow?""Speaker 2: Many things are troubling me. I don't know whether I should come and go.""Speaker 2: One of my neighbors has a dog.""Speaker 1: Does it make a lot of noise?""Speaker 2: I don't know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, It would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don't know if you're aware son, But there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, And we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There's just too much instability. I wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.""Speaker 1: But look at it this way, Every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, For example, They have 1. 4 billion people, Half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.""Speaker 2: Stop producing cigarettes.""Speaker 1: But that'll affect the national economy.""Speaker 2: That's right. But I don't think there are better ways.""Speaker 1: How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet?""Speaker 2: The Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned!""Speaker 1: If I taught you how to do it, I'm sure you could solve it.""Speaker 2: How did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube?""Speaker 1: I didn't really have to figure it out. I just followed the instructions!""Speaker 2: I had no idea there were a set of instructions. I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses!""Speaker 2: Why?""Speaker 1: Because you're from a foreign country. The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills.""Speaker 2: It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes, Right?""Speaker 1: You are a smart girl!""Speaker 2: To encourage the staff increases.""Speaker 1: Ok. Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM. At 12 AM, Back here for lunch.""Speaker 2: What about the afternoon?""Speaker 2: It's not only that she gossips, But she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers. She's not trustworthy, And in my opinion, I think she's nuts.""Speaker 1: So how do you develop good relationships in the office?""Speaker 2: It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net. It's been around since around 1991.""Speaker 1: I've heard about that, But I've never tried it.""Speaker 2: You ought to. One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time. A Chat session links you with cappuccinosippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network.""Speaker 1: I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers.""Speaker 2: It must be old.""Speaker 1: At least more than 100 years old.""Speaker 2: Let's enter it!""Speaker 1: I can't open the door.""Speaker 2: It must be locked.""Speaker 1: Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.""Speaker 2: She can't answer you.""Speaker 1: She must be deaf.""Speaker 2: It must be a haunted house. Are you frightened?""Speaker 2: Well, My family's away and I can't afford to do much. What about you?""Speaker 2: It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots. What about your plans?""Speaker 2: I'm feeling better today.""Speaker 1: How many days do you plan to finish reading it?""Speaker 2: About more three days, I think.""Speaker 1: Ok. After three days, I will come to you for it.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm still not sure what you're asking me.""Speaker 1: Is it true or isn't it?""Speaker 2: Do you want to know something about the American character?""Speaker 1: I just think you're trying to change the subject. But go ahead.""Speaker 2: No, This will help answer your question. In American society boys and girls are raised together. They're not segregated in their activities! Boys and girls go out together from an early age.""Speaker 2: That sounds like a good idea. The sky is clear, The sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze, So it is not too hot.""Speaker 1: I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado. But I must admit, This sure is a nice spring day.""Speaker 2: Hey, This spot in the shade looks really comfortable.""Speaker 1: Okay. Hey, Is that a dark cloud over there? Do you think it will rain after all?""Speaker 2: No problem. What should I bring?""Speaker 2: It was Professor Johnson.""Speaker 1: I have him this semester. What do you think about him?""Speaker 2: He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot, But fortunately, He's an easy grader.""Speaker 1: What did you end up getting?""Speaker 2: I got an A -. Sounds good, But none of my test scores were that high, So I don't know how I got a decent grade.""Speaker 1: That's probably because he grades on a curve.""Speaker 2: Are you enjoying the class so far?""Speaker 2: Definitely, It's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year!""Speaker 1: Yeah. Have you made any good resolutions for this new year?""Speaker 2: Some resolutions? That's a wonderful idea, But I have no idea yet. How about you?""Speaker 1: I want to be healthier this year, So I think I should take more exercise.""Speaker 2: That will be a good one! Anything else?""Speaker 1: Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry, Which is a mess!""Speaker 2: You've been always active and versatile. It seems that you are interested in everything.""Speaker 1: Oh, Really? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert, Painting, Handwriting, Reading novels and reading fashion magazines. What about yours?""Speaker 2: I have fewer hobbies than yours. That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting.""Speaker 1: Oh, You can't think like that. We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas. You like taking photos and going to photography shows, Why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable?""Speaker 2: Really? Are you OK?""Speaker 1: I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option. Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing?""Speaker 2: If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered.""Speaker 1: Hummum... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that. Anyway... Now that I'm going to have to make some claims, I think I'd better try and understand how the system works. Would you mind breaking it down for me?""Speaker 2: I need your help.""Speaker 1: How may I help you?""Speaker 2: I need to find this newspaper article.""Speaker 1: Have you checked the periodicals section yet?""Speaker 2: I forgot about that section.""Speaker 1: If you'd like, I can show you were to find it.""Speaker 2: Could you do that?""Speaker 1: Follow me.""Speaker 2: The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked, But the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone.""Speaker 1: Wow! What a hit!""Speaker 2: Yeah, He tackled him so hard his helmet came off.""Speaker 1: Is he ok?""Speaker 2: It looks like it, He's getting up.""Speaker 2: Yes, I am seven. I am a big girl now.""Speaker 1: We will have a party here, Right?""Speaker 2: What? Do you mean that you are pregnant? Is it true?""Speaker 1: Yes. We'll have our baby soon.""Speaker 2: Oh, Dear, I'm so happy.""Speaker 2: Hello Paul. I'm Jane. So what do you do?""Speaker 1: I'm in finance. You?""Speaker 2: Really? Me, Too. I work for an accountancy company,T &D. Maybe you've heard of them.""Speaker 1: T &D? Oh, Yes, Sure. How long have you worked there?""Speaker 2: About two years. And you? Are you based here?""Speaker 2: Be careful, Tom. Those are pretty heavy.""Speaker 2: No, I never do that.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: I don't want to mark my table, Of course.""Speaker 1: Well, Will you please put them down?""Speaker 2: I'm sorry. I thought you wouldn't come back so early.""Speaker 1: I forgot something on the table.""Speaker 2: I need to get one.""Speaker 1: You can apply for one right now, If you'd like.""Speaker 2: Okay. Let me do that right now.""Speaker 1: Could you fill out this application?""Speaker 2: I'm finished. Here you go.""Speaker 1: Could you please sign the back of the card?""Speaker 2: All right.""Speaker 1: That's it.""Speaker 2: The 1879 Large Dragon? Are you serious? How much?""Speaker 2: Sounds great!""Speaker 1: Say, Why don't you come with us? We have plenty of room.""Speaker 2: I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.""Speaker 1: I have told him how to do it several times, But he's never listened to me.""Speaker 2: Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss.""Speaker 1: Oh, I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff.""Speaker 2: Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do, Make sure you don't lose your temper.""Speaker 2: Right, She is so excited and simply can't wait.""Speaker 2: And you want to know what to wear?""Speaker 1: Well, Last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party, But I was overdressed. I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt, Blouse, Scarf, And medium heels... You know.""Speaker 2: That sounds just right to me. What was wrong with it?""Speaker 2: Now we're getting to the truth.""Speaker 1: There are shills. A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale.""Speaker 2: What do natives get?""Speaker 1: They get higher level English, Which is more formal than everyday spoken English. They also deal with matters of style and creativity.""Speaker 2: Do you mean that a native doesn't make any mistakes in grammar?""Speaker 2: Yes, You need the traveler's check but you needn't get any foreign currency. You can have my US Dollars, I don't need them.""Speaker 1: Really? That's very good of you, Helen. But I must get a new suitcase, My old one needs repairing.""Speaker 2: You needn't buy one. You can have mine.""Speaker 1: That's very kind of you, Helen. I hope you don't mind my leaving you like this. I need a holiday. It won't be long.""Speaker 2: Yes, It's got wireless Internet access.""Speaker 1: That's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth?""Speaker 2: Yes, But I don't really use it that often. Have you ever used it?""Speaker 1: No, But I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go.""Speaker 2: Yes, I guess I should try to use it.""Speaker 1: Does it have a camera?""Speaker 2: You're right. But you know it's so hard to give up the old habit like smoking.""Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.""Speaker 2: You know I often have to work far into the night. I need smoking to keep me awake.""Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed early and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.""Speaker 2: I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots. More often than not, I go with some of my friends. By the way, What are your favorites?""Speaker 1: I love swimming and cycling. On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour. In the afternoon, I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours.""Speaker 2: That's great! I think they do you a lot of good. Where do you swim?""Speaker 2: Someone told Joe off.""Speaker 1: He is then in a very difficult situation.""Speaker 2: The aquamedic pool is included. You can choose three.""Speaker 1: We'll do the seaweed wrap, The jet bath, And the foot massage.""Speaker 2: Are you taking anything?""Speaker 1: I'Ve got her a birthday present and I'll take a bottle fo wine too.""Speaker 2: That's a good idea. She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks. I think it's going to be a noisy party. I hope her neighbours don't mind too much.""Speaker 1: Helen gets on very well with her neighbours. I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the party too.""Speaker 2: Yes. They are completely different. Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother.""Speaker 1: What kind of person do you consider yourself to be?""Speaker 2: I think I'm polite, Careful, Relaxed and shy.""Speaker 1: Oh, I don't think you're shy! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party.""Speaker 2: Well, Yes, But those people always start talking to me. I never talk to them first. Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think. Anyway, You're certainly not shy!""Speaker 2: Good. I was thinking that I'd like to invite you to watch a movie. I can meet you at the cinema gate.""Speaker 1: What's the time?""Speaker 2: Six thirty, Tonight.""Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry I can't. Because I have to do some housework. You can ask Jenny to go with you.""Speaker 2: All right. Maybe next time I can go with you. Bye!""Speaker 2: No. If you do that, The workers won't like their jobs. They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover. Those things will increase you costs.""Speaker 1: How can a business maximise revenues?""Speaker 2: You need to invest in some good advertising. You have to know where your potential customers are and target them. It's no good trying to sell computer games to older people. The market is too small.""Speaker 2: That will be a throw in for Brazil. Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin, And the ref has called him offside.""Speaker 1: No question about it. He was offside by a mile! We have a goal kick for Ecuador. Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia, He shoots! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.""Speaker 2: Actually, I can do bothsoprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate. What about you.""Speaker 1: Looks like we both float back and forth. I'm baritone.""Speaker 2: Our bass section is really good. You're going to love singing with them.""Speaker 1: I heard them warming up earlier. You're right.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I'm lucky to be his wife.""Speaker 1: He's after your own heart, It is important.""Speaker 2: So he will make a perfect husband. Make sure you will be here next Monday.""Speaker 2: We're catching most of our fish with lures.""Speaker 1: Lures? We're using live bait over here.""Speaker 2: What kind of live bait are you using? Worms or minnows?""Speaker 1: We're using worms.""Speaker 2: Are you having any luck with the worms?""Speaker 1: No, We haven't even gotten a nibble today.""Speaker 2: That's too bad. Why don't you try using lures instead?""Speaker 1: I would, But I don't have any in my tackle box.""Speaker 2: To be honest, I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe.""Speaker 1: What about America? Have you ever been to the United States?""Speaker 2: You mean my favorite movie of all time? I guess I'd have to say “ pretty woman ”.""Speaker 2: So what happened?""Speaker 1: We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees.""Speaker 2: So what does that have to do with this position?""Speaker 1: Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted.""Speaker 2: I hope this won't be our last meeting.""Speaker 1: Of course not. You can come to London to visit me in future. And I also will come here if I have a chance.""Speaker 2: I will miss you.""Speaker 1: I will miss you, Too. You're really a good friend.""Speaker 2: It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow.""Speaker 2: Actually, It suggest English. The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, And japan – so beginning again.""Speaker 1: Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?""Speaker 2: So shall we have lunch together? I'd like to take you this time.""Speaker 1: I'd like to, But I can't.""Speaker 2: How come?""Speaker 1: I'Ve a lot of paper work to do right now. I'm behind schedule.""Speaker 2: All right. Can we make it another time?""Speaker 1: Sure, Thanks.""Speaker 2: I'll call you later. Bye.""Speaker 2: Why not? Do you think I should like modern dance?""Speaker 1: I think so, Because most young people like modern dances, Such as rock and roll.""Speaker 2: Oh, Sorry. I don't like them. Why not ask Lily. She likes modern dance.""Speaker 2: Well, Can you be more specific? There are a lot of websites about that.""Speaker 1: Yes, I want to know about the Normandy Landing.""Speaker 2: Ok. Well, Go to www. Google. Com, And type in Normandy Landing.""Speaker 1: Oh, Wow! There are lot of sites.""Speaker 2: Here, Try this one. It's a good site about Normandy Landing.""Speaker 1: Thanks.""Speaker 2: For detailed information, However, You should read a history book.""Speaker 2: It's on the other side of the Palace.""Speaker 1: That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: Yes, You're right. Politicians of all kinds, Religious people, And one or two madmen.""Speaker 1: Well, Are we going there today? I want to take shots there.""Speaker 2: Sure. I can see you're enjoying your trip today.""Speaker 2: Well, We went bungee jumping when we were in Australia.""Speaker 1: Wow! Isn't that dangerous?""Speaker 2: A little, But the rush was worth it.""Speaker 1: Tell me about it.""Speaker 2: We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us.""Speaker 1: 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.""Speaker 2: I'm afraid you're being too particular about your food.""Speaker 1: I eat dog food when my parents are out.""Speaker 2: We're in the same boat! I'Ve eaten fast food the whole week. I hate it now.""Speaker 1: Poor us! All this junk food lacks nutrition!""Speaker 2: Let'sdine out tonight for a change!""Speaker 2: Surely, There are other ways to save money.""Speaker 2: Get the goods on her? She never allows me to go to her office. And she is a good woman. She has been faithful all these years.""Speaker 2: Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch.""Speaker 2: Where do you want to sit?""Speaker 1: Front, Please.""Speaker 2: Are these seats all right? They're in the second rows.""Speaker 1: Do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows?""Speaker 2: Sorry. We'Ve nothing further back.""Speaker 1: All right. We'll take the second row. By the way, How much is it?""Speaker 2: Thirty yuan.""Speaker 2: Should I take my shoes off?""Speaker 1: Whatever you prefer.""Speaker 2: This is a very nice place. How long have you been living here now?""Speaker 1: Just over three weeks. Would you like a drink?""Speaker 2: Sure, What do you have?""Speaker 1: I've got white wine, Red wine, Gin and tonics, Ginger ale, Lemonade, Orange juice, And sprite.""Speaker 2: I'll have a glass of red wine please.""Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. The rainy season will be over soon.""Speaker 1: How long does the rainy season last?""Speaker 2: About two months.""Speaker 1: I can hardly stand these wet and cold days. It seems that it doesn't bother you very much.""Speaker 2: I'm used to this kind of days.""Speaker 1: But I prefer warm weather.""Speaker 2: Spring will come soon. And we will have some pleasant weather then.""Speaker 2: In fact, Our dormitory is much worse than they can be described.""Speaker 1: It's hard for me to imagine. How can you stand that?""Speaker 2: You'll get used to it gradually.""Speaker 1: Oh my God, Don't you know that such living environment is not healthy?""Speaker 2: Yes, We do. That's why we have a cleaning every three months.""Speaker 2: Bring them back to the circulation desk and renew them.""Speaker 1: Any terrible fines?""Speaker 2: Well, I have acrophobia. I have a chronic fear of flying.""Speaker 1: Oh really? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying. It's not that bad though, I mean, It is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour. I actually have arachnophobia.""Speaker 2: You're scared of spiders? I actually have two more phobias. Acrophobia and glossophobia.""Speaker 1: I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, But public speaking is not that bad.""Speaker 2: A party? Yes. I'd love to. Thank you for inviting me. Will Monica come?""Speaker 1: Of course.""Speaker 2: That's great! What time will it start at?""Speaker 1: At 6 o'clock.""Speaker 2: Ok. I'll come. See you then.""Speaker 2: Yes, That would be perfect.""Speaker 1: See you tonight then.""Speaker 2: Oh, I know. I will try my best.""Speaker 2: It's the end of the world for me.""Speaker 1: What makes you say that?""Speaker 2: Today, I'm told I failed three courses.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Work harder next term.""Speaker 2: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me.""Speaker 1: Don't loose heart. Everything will be fine.""Speaker 2: Oh, No.""Speaker 1: Yes, And the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it? - and his radio didn't work. So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi.""Speaker 2: So what did you do?""Speaker 2: Well, This one is not compulsory. It is just suggestion.""Speaker 2: That's OK. But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools.""Speaker 1: English school? What is that?""Speaker 2: This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English.""Speaker 1: Is that different from our school's English course?""Speaker 2: She's a lawyer.""Speaker 1: Is she American?""Speaker 2: No, But she speaks English fluently.""Speaker 1: She's really tall. Do you know her?""Speaker 2: Yes, I know her. We're friends.""Speaker 1: Who's that man standing next to her?""Speaker 2: Which man?""Speaker 1: That short guy on her right. What's his name?""Speaker 2: Oh, That's Matt.""Speaker 1: He's really good looking.""Speaker 2: Yeah.""Speaker 1: Do you know him?""Speaker 2: Oh, I hope he didn't notice me.""Speaker 1: Don't take any chances. It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again. He's already mad at you for last 2 times. Any more and he might fire you.""Speaker 2: You said it. It won't happen again. Do you really think he'd fire me?""Speaker 1: I think he might. You'd better go to his office.""Speaker 2: You are probably right. I'll go right now and apologize. I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic.""Speaker 2: I mean if you don't sell your shares now, It's quite likely that you'll end up losing your shirt.""Speaker 1: Is that so?""Speaker 2: Hmm... Well, The other one is good for the money. It's much cheaper. We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them.""Speaker 1: Hmm... I'd like the cheaper one, Please. Can I pay hy cheque?""Speaker 2: I went to Tamshui. You?""Speaker 2: Yes, I do. It's very interesting. What's your job?""Speaker 1: I'm a bus driver.""Speaker 2: Oh, Do you enjoy it?""Speaker 2: Well, What do you like doing?""Speaker 1: Travelling, Swimming, Going to the cinema. And you?""Speaker 2: I like painting, Sailing, Watching football and talking to you.""Speaker 1: I like talking to you, Too.""Speaker 2: Do you want to go to an exhibition? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow.""Speaker 2: Twilight? As in the vampire movies? No way, I am watching that, But I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn't make sense.""Speaker 1: Of course it does. It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You can see a couple who are in love but can't be together because they are so different. And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, Young people that make the movie even more enticing.""Speaker 2: Well. Yes, But those people always start talking to me. I never talk to them first. Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think. Anyway, You're certainly not shy!""Speaker 1: You're right. I love going out and making new friends.""Speaker 2: So, You'll be at my birthday party on Friday?""Speaker 2: At school. And I'm still learning it now.""Speaker 1: How long have you been learning it?""Speaker 2: About three years.""Speaker 1: Can you speak any other languages?""Speaker 2: I think I'm getting a heart stroke.""Speaker 1: The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat.""Speaker 2: Why? It's brand new, And it's perfect on you.""Speaker 1: But I bought it to get rid of the heat. Now it does nothing but burning my head.""Speaker 2: Beauty costs, Honey.""Speaker 1: Laugh all you want, Whatever. We need to get out of the heat.""Speaker 2: For accounting system and things like that, You mean?""Speaker 1: Yes, But they are used for other things, Too. Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris.""Speaker 2: Yes?""Speaker 1: The man asked where we want to go, Then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply. A few moment later, He gave us two tickets.""Speaker 2: Of course, His machine must have been connected to a computer.""Speaker 2: Do you want to type that letter?""Speaker 1: I'd rather you typed it.""Speaker 2: Do you want to tell her?""Speaker 2: Oh, Everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer.""Speaker 2: So you'll have a tour of the famous city.""Speaker 2: That's OK.""Speaker 1: I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain.""Speaker 2: It's no big deal.""Speaker 1: I really feel great shame. Let me buy a new one for you.""Speaker 2: I don't know. But they say that Mrs. Smith wears the pants in the house.""Speaker 1: You mean she bosses her husband around?""Speaker 2: That has nothing to do with it...""Speaker 1: I guess I'll just have to tell Mr. Robinson that you're too busy every evening – doing God knows what... God don't go on like this. If you absolutely refuse to take her out...""Speaker 2: I do.""Speaker 2: No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!""Speaker 1: Look, There are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, Or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before.""Speaker 2: I know, I know. I am really trying, But I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?""Speaker 2: I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises, And I also spend much time in memorizing English words.""Speaker 1: I suggest you read English texts aloud every day, And try to speak more. That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language.""Speaker 2: I mean in the library, Or in some information center. Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions.""Speaker 1: Yes, I know. I tried that. They don't have anything now. So what can I do?""Speaker 2: Well, Since you're a foreign student, It's hard. That's because it's actually illegal for you to work in America.""Speaker 1: I know that. You don't have to tell me that. That's my problem. I know I have the right to work for the university. That's legal. But they don't have a job for me. And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere.""Speaker 2: I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office?""Speaker 1: Yes, I can.""Speaker 2: Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor.""Speaker 1: I got it.""Speaker 2: If you do get lost, Just ask someone in the building to point the way.""Speaker 1: Thank you, I'll be there.""Speaker 2: Yes, They do.""Speaker 1: Do you think this is a good idea?""Speaker 2: Yes, I do.""Speaker 1: Do some children go on to university?""Speaker 2: Yes, They do.""Speaker 1: What examinations do they take first?""Speaker 2: O levels and A levels.""Speaker 1: How long do you usually stay at university?""Speaker 2: We hit a couple of local bars, And met up with some friends. Everything was cool until Mike came along, And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday!""Speaker 1: Oh no! Mike's birthday is a drinkfest for sure!""Speaker 2: Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar!""Speaker 1: Is that why you missed work today?""Speaker 2: It's seriously affecting my life! I can't sleep, I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered. Other people seem to handle stress okay... Why am I so weak?""Speaker 1: You're not weak... You're stressed out! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years. Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators... And as you might imagine, That was pretty stressful.""Speaker 2: Well, Iddin't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! We have so much in common. We like the same teams, Music, And most amazingly, We both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.""Speaker 1: It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?""Speaker 2: Be seeing you then!""Speaker 2: That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant.""Speaker 1: That's what I thought. I just thought I'd ask you and see what you thought of it. Anyway, What did you do yesterday evening?""Speaker 2: Well, It was a warm evening, So I stretched my legs. I walked along the canal for a couple of miles. Actually, Several other people had the same idea. I saw Bill.""Speaker 2: I'd be very glad to show you around, But I'm very busy right now. Could you come back about 3 thirty?""Speaker 1: Sure. 3 thirty this afternoon.""Speaker 2: Good. See you later.""Speaker 2: Those clothes do suit him better.""Speaker 1: Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted?""Speaker 2: How much did you want to spend?""Speaker 1: Money is no object.""Speaker 2: Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily.""Speaker 1: I will take ten.""Speaker 2: Do you want to add some baby's breath for that? They are equally popular now.""Speaker 1: Of course. Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon?""Speaker 2: Yes, But there is a five dollars delivery charge.""Speaker 2: Okay. Nope, It's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain.""Speaker 1: It was a good game, But not good enough to watch again. Keep surfing.""Speaker 2: Alright. Hmm, This movie is arerun... I don't know how many times I've seen this show... Commercial again... And a replay of the talk show... Oh no, This show is terrible, You don't wanna watch it.""Speaker 1: Oh, What is it?""Speaker 2: Yes. I'm sorry.""Speaker 1: Why didn't you just answer my question directly? Why would Chinese answer questions this way? I simply asked if you did it or not. It's a very simple question. And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer.""Speaker 2: Yes, I'm sorry. I know it bothers you very much. But I don't know why Chinese sometimes would do this.""Speaker 2: You have got a car, Haven't you?""Speaker 2: It's the same in Balloon. But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver. The fare was twenty dollars, And you gave him a five-dollar tip. That's twenty-five percent of the total! Too much!""Speaker 1: I disagree. He was polite and informative, And he drove smoothly. One should reward good service.""Speaker 2: I'll sign for dinner and charge it to our room. Let's see. The bill is one hundred dollars. That seems reasonable. How much tip should I leave?""Speaker 2: Right! I'll do it straight away.""Speaker 2: I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family, And I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on.""Speaker 2: It's a good way to save money.""Speaker 1: Saving money? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons?""Speaker 2: Oh, Taylor! I'm so... So happy. But then... Who's that?""Speaker 2: If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure!""Speaker 1: My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!""Speaker 2: Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married?""Speaker 2: Did you notice the characters on the lanterns?""Speaker 1: Sure. But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters. What do they say?""Speaker 2: They are puzzles. It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival.""Speaker 2: Really? Why?""Speaker 1: I've been thinking about this for several months, Well before the Spring Festival holidays.""Speaker 2: And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision?""Speaker 1: Yeah, After receiving my yearly bouns, I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market. I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise. It's unfair.""Speaker 2: Absolutely. With your expertise and experience, You're clearly working below your pay grade.""Speaker 2: Tom... You are her boss, You down. Of course, She's helpful to you.""Speaker 1: Come on. She's like that with everyone.""Speaker 2: Oh, Mostly fiction, Lots of romance, Science fiction, Biography, Stuff like that.""Speaker 1: Oh, What a cool job! How long have you worked there?""Speaker 2: No, Your uncle Jack is my brother, Bill is my brother-in-law, Your mom's brother.""Speaker 1: So his two daughters are my cousins?""Speaker 2: That's right, Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters.""Speaker 1: What are step-sisters?""Speaker 2: Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter. When she was young, Bill's first wife, Sarah's mom died. Three years later Bill married again.""Speaker 1: So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother. Right?""Speaker 2: It can't be true.""Speaker 1: Take my word for it.""Speaker 2: So what am I going to do?""Speaker 1: Just come to our house and stay over. You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose, 'Good morning!'.""Speaker 2: That sounds like a blue rose! My sitting by his bed?""Speaker 2: Impossible. My pager is really old. It doesn't display messages.""Speaker 1: Here, See for yourself. That's really strange! It's almost the same as when I...""Speaker 2: Well, Good-bye and have a good trip!""Speaker 2: How about yourself?""Speaker 1: I'm going to sweep the floor first.""Speaker 2: Daniel, I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard.""Speaker 1: Stand on the chair, Pig Tom. Use your brain.""Speaker 2: Ok, I've finished cleaning the blackboard.""Speaker 1: How about the podium?""Speaker 2: Oh, I forgot about it. I'll get it.""Speaker 1: Be quick, Please. Our teacher and classmates will come soon.""Speaker 2: Well, We were only there for three days, So we didn't do too much. We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times. And at night we walked around the city with some friends.""Speaker 1: Did you take any pictures?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them?""Speaker 1: Sure, I love looking at photos.""Speaker 2: This one is of my wife and me on the beach, And this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife.""Speaker 2: I wish you had been my history teacher! I might have got better marks!""Speaker 1: Some people say that history repeats itself.""Speaker 2: What does that mean? The same events never happen twice, Do they?""Speaker 1: The idea is that the people and dates change, But the reason why things happen stay the same.""Speaker 2: Yes, The sun shines day after day. It's neither too hot nor too cold.""Speaker 1: I wonder how long this weather can last.""Speaker 2: Oh, Let me see... It's three forty-five. Er... Wait, My watch is five minutes fast. So it should be three forty.""Speaker 1: Thank you. By the way, What day is today?""Speaker 2: Today is Friday. Are you new in Beijing?""Speaker 1: Yes, I've just come from the States, Yesterday in fact. I'm still a bit confused about the time.""Speaker 2: Welcome to Beijing. This is my business card. I'm an engineer. If you need any help in Beijing, Just give me a call.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's very nice of you. I don't want to sound pushy, But I still l have one more question.""Speaker 2: Well, The scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most.""Speaker 1: I loved it, Too. To tell you the truth, I even dropped tears.""Speaker 2: Actually, Tears also came to my eyes.""Speaker 1: It has got this year's Oscar Award.""Speaker 2: I've been completely out of touch with my old friends.""Speaker 1: It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much.""Speaker 2: Yes. I thought it was excellent. Didn't you?""Speaker 1: Not really. I thought it was disappointing.""Speaker 2: It's a nice cinema, Isn't it?""Speaker 2: Because in history, The Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation.""Speaker 1: Got it. Can we see any things left by them?""Speaker 2: Definitely. There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain.""Speaker 1: I want to see them. How can I go there?""Speaker 2: Cindy, I'm scared.""Speaker 1: But I have to go to my homeroom.""Speaker 2: Do we have the same classes today?""Speaker 1: No.""Speaker 2: Do you think the school can put us in the same homeroom?""Speaker 2: They give me a lot of congratulations.""Speaker 1: How long will you study there.""Speaker 2: Oh, Maybe three years. I will study and get the master degree first. Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back.""Speaker 1: Which university will you go to?""Speaker 2: Chicago University. My major is Economics.""Speaker 1: Good luck!""Speaker 2: No. Well, In America, 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink. So, Many guys celebrate it in bars.""Speaker 1: That's interesting. But it would be really expensive, I suppose. Just think about all the drinks.""Speaker 2: No. If it's your birthday, Then you don't need to pay a cent. Just blow out the candles and open the gifts. That makes the birthday a special day. Your friends will take care of everything.""Speaker 1: Wow. That's wonderful.""Speaker 2: I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people. I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, But...""Speaker 1: What is it?""Speaker 2: Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others.""Speaker 1: That makes you feel uncomfortable?""Speaker 2: Yeah. We never do that in a public office.""Speaker 1: Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy.""Speaker 2: I have felt that. One day when i was in a queue, Reading a newspaper story, The man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding.""Speaker 2: I'd be very glad to show you around, But I'm very busy right now. Could you come back about 3, 30?""Speaker 1: Sure. 3:30 this afternoon.""Speaker 2: Good. See you later.""Speaker 2: It's not as bad as I thought it would be. The freshmen that live nearby are really loud, Especially on the weekends. But, The rent is much cheaper than private housing, So it's worth it.""Speaker 1: Did you have to pay a deposit?""Speaker 2: No, But we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months, So for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month.""Speaker 1: Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent?""Speaker 2: I understand your point, But we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, We would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.""Speaker 1: You can't compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them, The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.""Speaker 2: Oh, That's a nice idea. Well, It's fine if you take our picture.""Speaker 2: So decode this for me, Madame Psycho.""Speaker 1: That's Madame Psychic to you.""Speaker 2: I'm waiting...""Speaker 2: He is tall and slim, Fair-haired.""Speaker 1: Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?""Speaker 2: How much was the ticket?""Speaker 2: Which one is hers?""Speaker 1: The blue SUV in front of the Honda.""Speaker 2: What should I take first?""Speaker 1: That chair over there, But please be careful with it. It was a gift from my mother-in-law.""Speaker 2: Don't worry, I won't drop it. Wow, It's really heavy. I don't think I can move it by myself.""Speaker 1: Let me help you with that. I don't want you to hurt your back.""Speaker 2: Where are you taking all this stuff?""Speaker 2: Well, I certainly couldn't have done it without your help. You are the best tutor I've ever had.""Speaker 1: Thank you, But it was your hard work that did it.""Speaker 2: He has a fever.""Speaker 1: Is he getting better now?""Speaker 2: What's wrong?""Speaker 1: There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.""Speaker 2: I see! Do you want to ask her out?""Speaker 1: Sure, But how?""Speaker 2: You can ask her out for drink after work.""Speaker 1: But for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.""Speaker 2: Then you've got a lot of homework to do. You need to get her notice first.""Speaker 1: Easier said than done.""Speaker 2: Are we going to walk or drive?""Speaker 1: The weather is really nice today. Let's walk.""Speaker 2: The weather is good now, But I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon.""Speaker 1: Alright, Then let's take an umbrella. Is your brother coming with us?""Speaker 2: No, He's still sleeping.""Speaker 1: Wow, It's already 10:00 AM. He must have been up late last night.""Speaker 2: That is true. Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way. For example, It is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off.""Speaker 2: I'm planning to return to China after graduation.""Speaker 1: Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.""Speaker 2: Well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment.""Speaker 1: Yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country.""Speaker 2: Of course. It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year.""Speaker 1: People here always wear the best clothes they have. Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve.""Speaker 2: Any other common customs of your New Year?""Speaker 1: Before the New Year, We always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year. On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a 'Happy New Year'. It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution.""Speaker 2: Ah, My girlfriend wanted to see that movie. I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time. How about The Cube?""Speaker 1: Isn't that a scary movie?""Speaker 2: How scary can it be? Come on, It'll be fun.""Speaker 1: Ok. I'll give it a try.""Speaker 2: That's the spirit. I'll see you tomorrow after class.""Speaker 2: I believe there are still two Psychology classes open.""Speaker 1: On what days are the classes?""Speaker 2: There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4.""Speaker 1: Can you tell me about the other class?""Speaker 2: It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday.""Speaker 1: You're positive that these are the only classes left?""Speaker 2: These two are the only ones.""Speaker 2: Well, I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock, Art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock, And math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock.""Speaker 1: What do you think about the teachers?""Speaker 2: To be honest, I liked all of them, Except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, He seem like an old person. He's so boring!""Speaker 1: That's too bad. How was your English teacher?""Speaker 2: She was great. In today's class, She gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to arm for exams, And to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing.""Speaker 2: Yes, I do like him.""Speaker 1: Then why are you hesitating?""Speaker 2: You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships. Last summer, I fell in love with John. But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks, And then wilted.""Speaker 1: One love drives out another. You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship.""Speaker 2: Do they know what the robber looks like?""Speaker 1: Yes, He's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, Black hair, And about 30 years old.""Speaker 2: What race is he?""Speaker 1: They didn't say.""Speaker 2: The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.""Speaker 1: Of course not. That would be racist.""Speaker 2: But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?""Speaker 1: Don't ask me.""Speaker 2: It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen. I also got something this morning.""Speaker 1: How many vegetables do you steal today?""Speaker 2: I stole many from Fred's farm, And from yours. I planned to have a dog on farm.""Speaker 1: So funny. By stealing, I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work.""Speaker 2: I could not agree with you more. For us, There are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however, I got lots of fun from stealing.""Speaker 2: Of course, Jim. Have I met Tom before?""Speaker 1: Mm — hmm. You met him last summer. He is small and very smart.""Speaker 2: Oh, Yes. I remember Tom. His family comes from Maine, Right?""Speaker 2: Good gracious! Are you sure?""Speaker 1: I am. Whatsmore, His wife is 84.""Speaker 2: Is she really?""Speaker 1: Yes, She is. And guess what, He is her sixth husband.""Speaker 2: Well, That's not possible. The computer's official student account has already been sent to the state. And that's what our budget is based on. Who told you that anyway?""Speaker 1: Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago. She said I just had to pay a late fee.""Speaker 2: She must have been a part-time worker. They didn't have much training. Why didn't you register then?""Speaker 2: Didn't I?""Speaker 1: You know you didn't.""Speaker 2: Well, I'm telling you now.""Speaker 1: Yes, But you might have told me before.""Speaker 2: I didn't think you'd be interested.""Speaker 1: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?""Speaker 2: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.""Speaker 2: What a pity. I believe it's a very good film.""Speaker 1: Do you go to the cinema a lot?""Speaker 2: Once a week. Most nights I sit at home and watch telly.""Speaker 1: Do you know what's on tonight by any chance?""Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry I don't. I never read the papers till I get home.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see. By the way, Where are you going for your holidays this year?""Speaker 2: I don't know yet. My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks. She Livesay the sea, You know.""Speaker 2: No I am free, I will be there, What time the thing starting?""Speaker 1: Around seven.""Speaker 2: Ok, Great, Should I bring anything?""Speaker 1: No, But thanks for offering, Actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat, Do you have any?""Speaker 2: Sure, I will be happy to bring a few, What is the address?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. I like them. Then what's your favorite book?""Speaker 1: I'm fond of history books.""Speaker 2: He meant it in a good way. You added a little spice to the performance.""Speaker 1: I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor. Ha-ha...""Speaker 2: Let me take your temperature with a thermometer.""Speaker 1: Ok.""Speaker 2: I think you have a small fever.""Speaker 1: I thought so. I felt dizzy this morning.""Speaker 2: And you shouldn't miss the Louvre Museum. You can stay there for at least a whole day.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea. I almost forget it. What else?""Speaker 2: The night life there. It's so romantic!""Speaker 1: Oh, Wonderful! How is the weather?""Speaker 2: I went there in August, And it was hot. But I was told autumn is the best season.""Speaker 2: Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?""Speaker 1: No, I'm not hungry.""Speaker 2: Pretty much. The land rises and falls only a few meters. The southeast, The hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters. There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country.""Speaker 1: Yes, There are. They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries.""Speaker 2: The coast of your country is very varied. The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches.""Speaker 2: No, She's average.""Speaker 1: What color are her eyes?""Speaker 2: They're dark gray.""Speaker 1: What color is her hair?""Speaker 2: It's blond.""Speaker 1: And how old is she?""Speaker 2: Oh, Do you know why? Actually, It's easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, Is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive!""Speaker 1: Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you.""Speaker 2: Yeah, They are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It's difficult and boring.""Speaker 2: It's me, Sir. But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it.""Speaker 2: I want to try different things before I find the one I really like.""Speaker 1: Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer?""Speaker 2: I could handle everything pretty well in the old position, So I decided to move around and learn something new.""Speaker 1: How's your current job going?""Speaker 2: So?""Speaker 1: So I think I may fall in love with her.""Speaker 2: You are attracted to her. That sounds great, But how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love?""Speaker 1: Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love?""Speaker 2: That's a big question. Well, If you are in love, Maybe you'll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all.""Speaker 1: That's what I did.""Speaker 2: Don't waste time.""Speaker 1: I'm curious about that.""Speaker 2: I'm glad that you like it. This is only the first time that I made it.""Speaker 1: You're great. Could you say it in Chinese?""Speaker 2: Well, The dorm's too noisy to study in, And I guess this place is too quiet.""Speaker 1: Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper?""Speaker 2: No. Prof. Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology. For once I wish she hadn't given us so much of a choice.""Speaker 1: Well, Why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico. You seem to be interested in that part of the world.""Speaker 2: You want to be a politician? Yuck.""Speaker 1: That's not like you to generalize.""Speaker 2: Sorry, You're right. I think you'll be a good politician.""Speaker 1: I think I can do a lot of good for our country.""Speaker 2: For me, Growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention. I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share.""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: I took the wrong bus.""Speaker 2: I went with my husband. Our first stop was Bangkok. We stayed there for 5 days. Then we flew to Hong Kong, Stopover for 3 days. Our last stop was China. We visited the Great Wall.""Speaker 1: You must have a wonderful time.""Speaker 2: Yes. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Have you traveled much, Luke?""Speaker 2: That's a notebook?""Speaker 1: Believe it!""Speaker 2: That happens in many places. In my city, There is a very good drug rehabilitation programme. The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes, But I don't know if that's the reason for.""Speaker 1: Some people believe that a tough approach is better. Other prefer a more lenient approach.""Speaker 2: I would also like to check out this video.""Speaker 1: Is that all?""Speaker 2: Yes, Just the video.""Speaker 1: May I see your library card?""Speaker 2: Here you go.""Speaker 1: You have to take care of this video.""Speaker 2: Oh, I will.""Speaker 1: You will be fined if you damage it.""Speaker 2: Absolutely. Who were you playing with?""Speaker 1: Oh, Just on my own. I just joined, So I don't really have any partners.""Speaker 2: Really? Oh, Well, In that case we should play together some time. What's your handicap?""Speaker 1: 16. Yours?""Speaker 2: No kidding! I'm 16, Too. We should definitely play together some time. My name's Bob.""Speaker 1: Jane. Nice to meet you.""Speaker 2: Me too. So, Do you like the course?""Speaker 2: It's great! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular. Have you been here for a long time?""Speaker 1: About six years...""Speaker 2: What do you do for a living?""Speaker 1: I manage one of the ski lodges. It's a great job, I can spend a lot of my time outdoors, And I also get to ski for free all season.""Speaker 2: Wow, Talk about job perks! That's great. I would like to do something exciting like that. But I am only an accountant. Not too much excitement there. Huh?""Speaker 2: No, There aren't. This map just show the geographical features. Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world.""Speaker 1: The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, Most countries are tiny.""Speaker 2: I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall.""Speaker 1: Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you.""Speaker 2: To tell the truth, I don't like it.""Speaker 1: Really? You must like tango, Right?""Speaker 2: Oh, It's really beautiful, But I just can't dance it well.""Speaker 1: Don't be so modest. I'm sure you can dance it very well. Let's dance it now.""Speaker 2: Ok. I'll have a try.""Speaker 1: Oh, You dance it so well.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliment.""Speaker 2: How did you feel when you graduated?""Speaker 1: It was a round day for me. My family attend the graduation ceremony. I was so nervous. I couldn't find my cap and gown, But all worked out in the end.""Speaker 2: What did you do after graduation?""Speaker 1: I was planning to attend gradate school, But then I was offered a good job doing marketing, So I changed my mind.""Speaker 2: Sounds like you're happy with your decision.""Speaker 2: Excellent choice. Can I dish you up some chicken?""Speaker 1: Yes, The chicken looks wonderful!""Speaker 2: How about some salad to go with your chicken?""Speaker 1: Sure, I love salad!""Speaker 2: Would you like to have rice with your chicken?""Speaker 1: Yes, I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken!""Speaker 2: It's white gold.""Speaker 1: Where did you buy it?""Speaker 2: My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. And he let me pick it out.""Speaker 1: That's so sweet. What was the occasion?""Speaker 2: That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something.""Speaker 1: You're so lucky. If he bought you something for no special day, I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday.""Speaker 2: My birthday is coming up. We'll find out pretty soon.""Speaker 2: It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off.""Speaker 1: What?""Speaker 2: The World Cup! The first match is today! It's Mexico vs. South Africa! It's going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa.""Speaker 1: I have no idea what you're talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.""Speaker 2: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, Man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, Each g.""Speaker 2: I often play badminton with my parents.""Speaker 1: You? Play badminton? That's unbelievable! You are shorter than a racket.""Speaker 2: Hey, I'm good at playing it.""Speaker 1: Says who?""Speaker 2: My parents.""Speaker 1: Oh, I see.""Speaker 2: How about you, Daniel?""Speaker 1: I'm a real man, And I like football.""Speaker 2: Well, Who is your favorite football player?""Speaker 2: You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?""Speaker 1: No, I don't know where that is.""Speaker 2: The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be.""Speaker 1: I think I can find it.""Speaker 2: You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.""Speaker 2: Sounds great, I'd very much like having something thanks, When?""Speaker 1: Around six pm.""Speaker 2: Do you need help setting up or anything? I don't mind. I like to do that kind of thing. It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating.""Speaker 1: No. Thank you. I can handle it, But thanks for the offer.""Speaker 2: Ok, I will see you again.""Speaker 2: Oh, What exactly is problem?""Speaker 1: Well, The traffic is very loud. I got no sleep last night.""Speaker 2: What are the temperatures in winter? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees.""Speaker 1: In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that. The streets are often icing in the morning. With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms.""Speaker 2: Yeah, We do. In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon. I heard your city has a lot of fog, Is that true?""Speaker 2: What do you do there?""Speaker 1: I main marketreasearch, And you?""Speaker 2: I'Ve beaning worked IBM for years. I am vested personnel file system, He is the after sale survise director. He such a nice boss, I like working for him.""Speaker 1: Really? I don't believe I would met him, Is he here now?""Speaker 2: Yes, That's him over there-the taller, Handsome one. Would you let me introduce you?""Speaker 2: Anything you say or do might make it worse. Just try to ride out the storm for a while.""Speaker 1: She's always bothering me. What should I do?""Speaker 2: You'd better leave her alone.""Speaker 1: But she always harps on me.""Speaker 2: Just tell her off.""Speaker 2: They could generally be divided into two categories.""Speaker 1: Well, Direct ones are the pollution directly from factories, Refineries waste treatment plants etc., Aren't they?""Speaker 2: Yeah. They are emitted directly into urban water supplies.""Speaker 1: But what about the indirect ones?""Speaker 2: Sure. She is the ideal girl, The one I had dreamed of.""Speaker 1: What type of girl is she?""Speaker 2: She is the mature, Stable, Feminine type. I hope one day I can marry her.""Speaker 2: Thanks. Maybe if things slow down later I'll stop by your table.""Speaker 1: I'm Robert, At your service.""Speaker 2: I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time.""Speaker 1: Which anti-virus program would you recommend?""Speaker 2: How you tried this one? It's very good and you can download it for free on the internet. You can also download updates for free.""Speaker 2: Will, I'm under a lot of pressure. My manager is very pushy. He assigned me two projects. Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them.""Speaker 1: Is there anything I can do for you?""Speaker 2: Well, I guess no one can help me but myself. For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress.""Speaker 1: I know your feeling. Take it easy and say something to me if you like.""Speaker 2: Hasn't it! It's been cold and windy recently. Do you like the weather here?""Speaker 1: Not really, But I've got used to it now.""Speaker 2: Oh, I'm going for a trip to New York this autumn. What's the weather like in New York?""Speaker 1: Not quite good. It's windy and dry. We have got continental climate there. It's dry all the year round. Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York.""Speaker 2: Is it cold in autumn there? Should I take any warm clothes with me?""Speaker 2: Middle-aged means in the middle, Ethel, Middle of life. People don't live to a hundred and fifty.""Speaker 1: Oh, We are the part on the edge of middle. That's all.""Speaker 2: Oh, You know, We are not middle-aged. You're old, And I'm aging.""Speaker 1: Oh, Fool! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the lowsixties. Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this?""Speaker 2: If we do, Too many people might attend. Perhaps we should invited all of them, But make a small charge to attend.""Speaker 1: Good idea. We should also hold a series of presentations. We could have presentations on the history of the university, The courses we offer, And our links with other universities.""Speaker 2: Good idea! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives.""Speaker 2: I'm fine. Thank you.""Speaker 1: Where are you from, Sam?""Speaker 2: I'm from England.""Speaker 1: What is your job?""Speaker 2: Yes.""Speaker 1: I'm a new student in the school. My name's John.""Speaker 2: Nice to meet you, John.""Speaker 2: That would be a definite bonus.""Speaker 1: You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now.""Speaker 2: How can we do that?""Speaker 1: You'd probably need a faster processor, To begin with. And you also need a more powerful hard disc, More memory and a faster modem. Do you have a CD-ROM drive?""Speaker 2: No.""Speaker 2: Right!""Speaker 1: I'm getting a little short on cash. Let's just window shop a little.""Speaker 2: Ok.""Speaker 1: Hey, Jeanine, Get a load of that. It's beautiful.""Speaker 2: Ahahah, And I thought you were tired.""Speaker 1: You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses.""Speaker 2: It sure looks special, Looks expensive too.""Speaker 1: Sure does. Hey, Can I sponge a little cash of you?""Speaker 2: But don't you like this place? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely.""Speaker 2: Why not start with the most interesting one?""Speaker 1: Actually, I'm interested in all of them. The more choices we have, The harder to make a decision.""Speaker 2: Well, It may not be that simple. Not everyone likes public transport.""Speaker 1: Why not? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains.""Speaker 2: What date, Sir?""Speaker 1: October 16th.""Speaker 2: Let me see. Yes, We still have some tickets left. Which performance?""Speaker 1: 7:30 p.M. Performance, Please.""Speaker 2: Ok, We have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan.""Speaker 1: I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan, Please.""Speaker 2: All right. May I have you name, Please?""Speaker 1: Du Kun.""Speaker 2: Will you forgive me. Could you return my camera?""Speaker 1: We will keep and return it later.""Speaker 2: Oh, I see. Then, Can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere?""Speaker 2: Can you help me? You know I do need the scholarship.""Speaker 1: I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year.""Speaker 2: That's a big mistake, You should always have a good breakfast. You will not run your car without fuel, And as well you won't expect your body to work without food.""Speaker 1: I never thought about it that way.""Speaker 2: I bet you eat a large evening meal, Then sit and watch TV or read a book. Then instead of burning off your energy, Your body stores it as fat.""Speaker 1: Oh doctor, I feel so foolish.""Speaker 2: In general, A set of golf clubs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Pw ; Woods : 1, 3, 5 and a putter.""Speaker 1: So many?""Speaker 2: This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs. It depends on your preferences.""Speaker 1: Have you heard of Tiger Woods?""Speaker 2: No, What?""Speaker 1: He had his car stolen. Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car.""Speaker 2: What do you mean?""Speaker 1: Well, Apparently, He was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in.""Speaker 2: Crikey. Where did this happen?""Speaker 1: In Taichung, I think.""Speaker 2: Thanks, But I speak English with a strong German accent.""Speaker 1: But let me tell you, You're doing just fine. I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German. By the way, How long have you been learning English?""Speaker 2: Oh yes, How's she getting on?""Speaker 1: Ok, I suppose, But she's had a rough time in the last few years, She got divorced.""Speaker 2: What, From Peter?""Speaker 2: Wow, You were pulling my leg all along. I was really fooled.""Speaker 2: I saw Forrest Gump the other day.""Speaker 1: What type of movie is that?""Speaker 2: The movie type is drama.""Speaker 1: I can't believe you are watching movies. The weather is great. You should be outside.""Speaker 2: I hate the hot weather. I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner.""Speaker 1: What else do you like to do besides watching movies?""Speaker 2: I like to play computer games, Read books, Go shopping, And play pool.""Speaker 1: Out of those what is your favorite?""Speaker 2: Forget it. It's my pleasure. You mean a lot to me.""Speaker 2: Yep. If you are a good singer, Your audience will feel comfortable, Right?""Speaker 1: I can not agree with you more. And if you are an awful one, That will be funny.""Speaker 2: I remembered Tom is always out of tune. We burst into laughter.""Speaker 1: Is that true? Shall we invite him to join with us?""Speaker 2: I heard they were just married for half a year.""Speaker 1: That's true. She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things.""Speaker 2: Yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock.""Speaker 1: You said it. You know, They fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.""Speaker 2: Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.""Speaker 2: I think they are quite reasonable, And the vegetables are very fresh.""Speaker 1: I see you have bought some coffee. Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it?""Speaker 2: Well, At least half a year. Do I have to do my own grocery shopping?""Speaker 1: Usually the host family prepares at least two meals a day for you.""Speaker 2: She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin.""Speaker 2: Saturday my parents are coming to town. What's up?""Speaker 1: What about tonight? Do you have plans tonight?""Speaker 2: No. Did you want to go do something?""Speaker 1: Yes! Yes! I want to take you to dinner.""Speaker 2: That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there?""Speaker 1: I'm not really in the mood for Italian, Actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.""Speaker 2: If you want spicy food, Then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road?""Speaker 1: I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, They've westernized their food, So it's not actually that spicy.""Speaker 2: Oh. It was great. I love Ma Lin. He's my favourite table tennis player. Have you seen anything yet?""Speaker 1: Oh I still haven't managed to get any tickets. I'd love to see something though.""Speaker 2: Well, Let's go to the marathon tomorrow then! We can just stand by the side of the road.""Speaker 2: Me too. I want to know more about you, Eg, What's your real name and what do you look like...""Speaker 1: & you?""Speaker 2: Look, I am playing the piano for you.""Speaker 1: Oh, Thanks. I wanna see the real you.""Speaker 2: Sorry, I have no photo in my computer. And I have no scanner. I will show you later.""Speaker 1: Ok! Before that I'll take this one as you.""Speaker 2: Ha! She is too little.""Speaker 2: I'm good. How are you?""Speaker 1: Good. Do you speak English?""Speaker 2: A little. Are you American?""Speaker 1: Yes.""Speaker 2: Where are you from?""Speaker 1: I'm from California.""Speaker 2: Nice to meet you.""Speaker 2: No, I live alone in a flat near my work place.""Speaker 1: Do you often go back to see your parents.""Speaker 2: Well, My mother came from a big family, And wanted to have one of her own. My father was an only child, And didn't really care about having a large family, But my mother talked him into it.""Speaker 1: Jeez, Seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.""Speaker 2: It can be hard, And there are certain sacrifices you have to make.""Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I'm not married. I'm still single.""Speaker 1: Then, When do you plan to get married?""Speaker 2: Yes, Here it is.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much. And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years?""Speaker 2: I've got a letter from my bank here. It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies.""Speaker 1: Could I see that, Please?""Speaker 2: It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain.""Speaker 1: That doesn't sound pretty.""Speaker 2: Do you have any plans for tomorrow?""Speaker 1: Well, I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends.""Speaker 2: You might want to change your plans. With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow, The roads are going to be rather slippery.""Speaker 1: I suppose I should. I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions. Do you have any plans for tomorrow?""Speaker 2: Many. Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year.""Speaker 1: But why do so many people live there?""Speaker 2: Most people grow accustomed to the climate, But there are many others who complain about it all the time.""Speaker 1: Are there any cities where it rains a lot?""Speaker 2: Several. Two good examples are Seattle, In the state of Washington, And Portland, Oregon.""Speaker 2: I forgot.""Speaker 1: You forgot? You...""Speaker 2: No. I've been visiting relatives recently.""Speaker 1: That's nice. Where have you been?""Speaker 2: I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco.""Speaker 1: Are you busy now?""Speaker 2: No. Why?""Speaker 1: How about a coffee in that cafe?""Speaker 2: Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses. Even Larry. He might be a pain to be around, But he's also very good at staying in budget on projects. Mary, On the other hand, Spends our project money like there's no tomorrow. Also, She's never willing to stay a little later at the office. She always leaves at 5pm sharp.""Speaker 2: Who are those kids walking down the aisle?""Speaker 1: That's the flower girl and the ring bearer. I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew. Oh, They look so cute!""Speaker 2: I just hope the priest makes it quick. I'm starving. I hope the food's good at the reception.""Speaker 1: That's all you ever think about, Food! Oh, I think the bride's coming now! She looks gorgeous. Wait, What's she doing? Where's she going?""Speaker 2: What does that mean?""Speaker 1: Well, Basically if your heart stops pumping blood, Or your lungs stop pumping air, Then we need to get them going again! That's when we have to apply this procedure. Let's begin! I need a volunteer.""Speaker 2: Me! Me!""Speaker 2: On the level?""Speaker 1: I'll say. I knew Sally would finally show her true colors. When she got her final test results back from Mr. Leo, She started yelling at him. You should have heard her. I'Ve never seen anyone get so upset before. To make a long story short, It seems that Mr. Leo failed her because he caught her cheating.""Speaker 2: That's no laughing matter. That means she'll have to take the whole course again. I can't believe she's going to have to start from the beginning.""Speaker 2: He must be very brave.""Speaker 2: Yes, Of course.""Speaker 2: Well, I am sorry you have to leave so early.""Speaker 1: Thank you very much. I really had a good time.""Speaker 2: Well, Thank you for coming.""Speaker 1: So see you.""Speaker 2: I'Ve got a fever and really a bad headache.""Speaker 1: Oh, That's too bad. Why don't you take some aspirin?""Speaker 2: I'Ve already tried some but it didn't help.""Speaker 1: Well, It's necessary for you to see a doctor.""Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I should.""Speaker 1: Well, You'd better get some rest.""Speaker 2: Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: Ha ha, Come on! Well, I'Ve been watching what I eat, And working out three times a week. By the way, I heard your son recently graduated!""Speaker 1: Yes, My little Paul is finally a doctor. They grow up so fast you know.""Speaker 2: I promise you that I have the time to do this. If I didn't, I wouldn't offer to help.""Speaker 1: What would be the best time for you to help me?""Speaker 2: Tomorrow night would work for me.""Speaker 1: Should we just meet here?""Speaker 2: Ok, And I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation.""Speaker 1: I'll see you then.""Speaker 2: You pay for the taxi and dinner, Then to even things up.""Speaker 2: It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time.""Speaker 1: Even he's not coming back to school anymore, You still can call him and meet him on weekends.""Speaker 2: Are you? I thought you had something to drink at her home.""Speaker 1: No. Edith didn't give anything to drink.""Speaker 2: I'll buy you a drink.""Speaker 2: You're right. We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey, Because we will be in built-up area.""Speaker 1: So, Shall we allow three hours to cover the distance?""Speaker 2: Ok. You haven't seen my company car, Have you?""Speaker 1: No. Let me take a look... It's longer than my car.""Speaker 2: But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750.""Speaker 1: The advertised rate is based on double occupancy.""Speaker 2: When I booked the room, Your staff didn't mention this. And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that.""Speaker 2: I had to move it, So that I can get my bike through.""Speaker 1: How dare you be so inconsiderate? That's wrong.""Speaker 2: I am awfully sorry. I didn't think you would mind so much.""Speaker 1: Never do that again.""Speaker 2: It's too raw. I wanted mine well done, But this one here is almost medium.""Speaker 1: I am sorry you didn't enjoy it, Sir. I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked. How is your steak this time, Sir?""Speaker 2: Very good. It's done just right this time, Thank you.""Speaker 1: I am glad you enjoy it. I will tell this to the chef. Would you like some more beer?""Speaker 2: Yes, Please give me another Calsberg.""Speaker 2: Nothing! Anyway, You're right, There's no reason this has to be nasty. My lawyer tells me you'Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, As well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that's done... Finally.""Speaker 1: Let's not go there, Joanne! Ok, So let's start with the record collection, I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.""Speaker 2: Just get out of my face!""Speaker 1: Woo, Easy.""Speaker 2: Leave me alone!""Speaker 1: What are you so ticked off about?""Speaker 2: I don't want to talk about it.""Speaker 1: Maybe I can help.""Speaker 2: I blew the finally exam.""Speaker 1: You've got to be joking.""Speaker 2: No, I'm not.""Speaker 2: Can I check this one out?""Speaker 1: I'm sorry. It's for reference only, So it must stay in the library. But you're welcome to look through it.""Speaker 2: Ok. And I'd like to check these books out.""Speaker 1: All right. They're due back next Wednesday.""Speaker 2: We have tickets for the matinee. It starts at 3p.M.""Speaker 1: Ok. I'll take it.""Speaker 2: Where would you like to sit?""Speaker 1: Do you have anything in the middle section? I want a good view, But sitting too close hurts my eyes.""Speaker 2: Can I bring my camera with me?""Speaker 1: Sure. Bring enough films, Please.""Speaker 2: I'll be very glad if you would help.""Speaker 1: I'd like to wish you every success in your new venture.""Speaker 2: Thank you. I wish I would.""Speaker 2: Can I check this one out?""Speaker 1: I'm sorry. It's for reference only, So it must stay in the library. But you're welcome to look through it.""Speaker 2: Ok. And I'd like to check these books out.""Speaker 1: All right. They're due back next Wednesday.""Speaker 2: I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn't depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.""Speaker 1: What about your mother? Did she help you?""Speaker 2: Yes, She did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can't depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That's it. I had to care for them most of the time.""Speaker 2: Ha-ha, So you believe in astrology?""Speaker 1: What's strange about that! As a person born under the sign of Cancer, I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life. But according to astrology, Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking. They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life.""Speaker 2: Is that so? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology. It's all stereotypes!""Speaker 2: Yes, We do. My parents prepare dinner for me.""Speaker 1: What would you do at the party?""Speaker 2: We sing \"Happy Birthday\" at the party and have birthday cakes.""Speaker 1: Do you know when people began to sing the song \"Happy Birthday\"?""Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.""Speaker 1: Let me tell you the story. In 1892, Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called 'Good Morning to you'. But later someone added the words 'Happy Birthday' to their tune.""Speaker 2: So the 'Happy Birthday' song has been popular since then?""Speaker 2: Yes I am. You can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre, Title or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.""Speaker 1: I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.""Speaker 2: That would be in our children's section. That book shelf there on the right.""Speaker 2: You miss me, Don't you?""Speaker 1: Don't push your luck, Dave.""Speaker 2: Ok, I'm in. When do I start?""Speaker 2: I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room. What do you think about lavender?""Speaker 2: It's my acceptance letter from UCLA.""Speaker 1: What does it say?""Speaker 2: I'Ve been accepted!""Speaker 1: Are you serious?""Speaker 2: I'm serious.""Speaker 1: Good for you!""Speaker 2: NyU was my first choice, But UCLA is just fine.""Speaker 1: I'm so proud of you.""Speaker 2: I know. I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm. It was pouring with rain all afternoon.""Speaker 1: We really have some movable weather sometime. I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round.""Speaker 2: If it was sunning all year round there would be drought. You probably would not like it either.""Speaker 2: Yes, They are. This afternoon, I'm going to prune the hedge.""Speaker 1: The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low. Would you like me to cut them off for you?""Speaker 2: Thank you! That would be very kind of you. I have a saw in the garden shed.""Speaker 1: When the lower branches are removed, You'll be able to sit under the tree.""Speaker 2: Yes. An automatic message says your phone is not in service.""Speaker 1: Really? I had no idea. Let me check. Yes, It's dead. There's no dial tone.""Speaker 2: So I couldn't get through. I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start. It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater. That's why I'm late.""Speaker 1: But this is terrible. I'm expecting important calls.""Speaker 2: About what?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. I know I've put on weight this winter.""Speaker 1: So you are watching your weight, Aren't you?""Speaker 2: Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch.""Speaker 1: Have you talked to him?""Speaker 2: It's excellent.""Speaker 1: Thank you for your compliment. Won't you try this fish with white sauce? I'm rather round of it.""Speaker 2: It's delicious.""Speaker 1: What sort of western food do you like best?""Speaker 2: I like beefsteak very much. Have you tried Chinese dishes?""Speaker 2: When you get the signed add slip, You must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added. Can you find the office?""Speaker 1: I think I know where it is.""Speaker 2: Across the courtyard on the right is the office. Follow the signs to the correct line. Is that clear?""Speaker 1: Thank you for your directions. It's clear.""Speaker 2: You can't miss it. Add the class and then come back. We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet.""Speaker 1: That's great. Thank you so much.""Speaker 2: Water is rationed. We can only use a certain amount each month. It means that we cannot use some modern household items, Like washing machines. They use too much water.""Speaker 1: I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.""Speaker 2: Yes, I agree. The air here is much more polluted than in my country. Of course, My country is more agricultural and has much less industry.""Speaker 2: No way. I will be scared out of my wits.""Speaker 1: That's funny, I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside.""Speaker 2: Hey, How could you like to taste my fist?""Speaker 1: Alright, All joking aside, What kinds of moves do you like?""Speaker 2: Um, Let me see, Romance, Comedy. Documentary, Action, Science fiction, Animated and so on.""Speaker 2: I'm Helen Baker.""Speaker 1: Glad to meet you, Ms. Baker.""Speaker 2: Glad to meet you, Too.""Speaker 1: Where are you from, Ms. Baker?""Speaker 2: I'm from New Zealand.""Speaker 1: What do you do for a living?""Speaker 2: I'm a teacher.""Speaker 2: Oh, I took a shine to him when we met for the first time. But it comes and goes.""Speaker 2: The one next to the telephone.""Speaker 1: I don't know. Never saw him before. Why?""Speaker 2: One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks.""Speaker 1: Can you stand?""Speaker 2: I don't think so. It's kind of sore.""Speaker 1: What I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat.""Speaker 2: It's that really necessary?""Speaker 2: How do you get through the stuffy daytime?""Speaker 2: Have they set a date for the wedding?""Speaker 2: 27th day of the fourth month.""Speaker 1: By the way, Could you tell me when the film will begin?""Speaker 2: It will begin at 5:30.""Speaker 1: I am afraid I can't be there on time.""Speaker 2: You can see it tomorrow.""Speaker 2: Really? What's he been doing?""Speaker 1: You know, Just giving me lots to do. I'm really busy right now.""Speaker 2: Are you? What are you busy with?""Speaker 2: Criminals are clever? They're only successful when people are careless.""Speaker 1: I don't know. The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good.""Speaker 2: If your uncle had an alarm system, Then it wouldn't have happened.""Speaker 1: He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn't stop them from disabling it. And on a crowded street too.""Speaker 2: Didn't anyone stop them?""Speaker 2: Sounds practical! To be honest, Sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career. I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills.""Speaker 1: Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do. It seems that you need this course more than I do. I love my current job. If I take this course, I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work. If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships, That will be great. I need these to improve my current work performance.""Speaker 2: As you like.""Speaker 1: Would you like any tea, Dear?""Speaker 2: It doesn't make any difference to me.""Speaker 1: Oh, You're not listening to me.""Speaker 2: Do I need to pay to use it?""Speaker 1: You have to pay to use the copier.""Speaker 2: How much do you charge?""Speaker 1: You need to pay ten cents for every copy.""Speaker 2: Is there a maximum number of copies I can make?""Speaker 1: You can make as many copies as you want.""Speaker 2: I'm going to need you to show me how to use the machine.""Speaker 1: There are instructions posted on the copier.""Speaker 2: How do you do?""Speaker 1: Please sit down. Help yourself just like you are at home.""Speaker 2: What would you like to drink?""Speaker 2: I love the museums, Too.""Speaker 1: But the traffic is pretty bad.""Speaker 2: Yeah. I hate all this traffic. It's really noisy.""Speaker 1: Listen, It's almostdinnertime. There are lots of restaurant around here. What do you want to try? Italian? Greek? Japanese? Thai?""Speaker 2: I can't stand making decisions. You choose!""Speaker 2: Yes. Let's go inside and you can open it up.""Speaker 1: Wow! It's big! What could it be?""Speaker 2: I'll give you two clues. First, It cost more than $ 250. And second, It's not big, But fat.""Speaker 2: My immediate family is very large. It's my mother, My father, My two older brothers, My younger sister and me.""Speaker 1: I have a small family. They are my parents, My younger brother and me.""Speaker 2: I thought you were the only child in the family. Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s?""Speaker 1: Yes, It did. But my parents are ethnic minority people. It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children.""Speaker 2: I think, In some way it is an act of God, But in another way, It just is caused by us.""Speaker 1: For example?""Speaker 2: We didn't pay attention to the environment, Cut down trees and polluted the air.""Speaker 2: I'd be delighted to, John. Saturday did you say?""Speaker 1: Yes, If that's all right for you.""Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure I'll be all right. In fact, I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you. What time are you planning to start?""Speaker 1: Oh, Good. If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock, That would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner.""Speaker 2: No, Wait, You will be too cold withoutmittens.""Speaker 1: Alright. See ya!""Speaker 2: Hold on, With that wind, You're going to catch a cold. Wear this scarf.""Speaker 1: Ok, See you after school...""Speaker 2: Oh... And earmuffs! Put these on... Here we go.""Speaker 1: Mom?""Speaker 2: Yes, Honey...""Speaker 2: Nothing. I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat.""Speaker 2: Yeah, And most importantly, She's single! Man, I could tell from the moment I saw her, She's the girl of my dreams!""Speaker 1: So I take it you two are hitting it off? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor, But what if you break up?""Speaker 2: I don't know. I am not really worried about that. I don't wanna lose before even starting. Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her.""Speaker 1: Sounds like you've got some competition. You made a move already?""Speaker 2: You're right. But you know it's so hard to give up the old habit like smoking.""Speaker 1: But you should make up your mind first.""Speaker 2: You know I often have to work far into the night. I need smoking to keep me awake.""Speaker 1: Why don't you go to bed early and get up early? You'll have the same time for work.""Speaker 2: And my new car. To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car. That's what hurts me most.""Speaker 1: What's so terrible too, Is the fools we've made of ourselves.""Speaker 2: I hardly dare call the police. They'll just laugh at us.""Speaker 1: I'll never get over it. Oh, Harry, It was all so unnecessary. That man!! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up?""Speaker 2: It was entertaining in some ways. But in general I didn't like it.""Speaker 1: Why not?""Speaker 2: I just think the humor was too gross. There were too many disgusting things in it. I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny.""Speaker 1: It wasn't a dirty movie. There wasn't even any nudity.""Speaker 2: No, You're right. But nudity doesn't bother me. What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation, Stuff like that. It was too sick.""Speaker 2: Yes, It can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies.""Speaker 1: Really? Have you ever been there?""Speaker 2: A couple of times.""Speaker 1: Can you go there with me? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me.""Speaker 2: Tom is a kind guy, But addicted to gambling. He spends all his time gambling in the casino. And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer, So she divorced him. Is that right?""Speaker 1: Yeah, Quite right. Gambling broke up a happy family.""Speaker 2: Yeah! Gambling is often a curse. By gambling we lose time and treasure, Two things most precious to a man.""Speaker 1: Besides that, Many people took to gambling and got in over their heads, And gradually ruined themselves.""Speaker 2: Fine, Do you know where my office is?""Speaker 1: No, I'm not sure.""Speaker 2: Remember, It is in the E building on the third floor.""Speaker 1: I see.""Speaker 2: Don't worry, It will work out fine once you get there. I'll see you then.""Speaker 1: I'll see you then.""Speaker 2: You just said 10 rounds.""Speaker 1: ' Round 'and' frame 'are two different terms.""Speaker 2: Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this.""Speaker 2: I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail. I probably fell down fifty times.""Speaker 1: Fifty times?""Speaker 2: Yes, It was really stupid.""Speaker 1: And how much did it cost to rent it?""Speaker 2: It was fifty dollars for a half-hour.""Speaker 1: Well, That's not too bad then.""Speaker 2: What do you mean? It's expensive!""Speaker 2: Give me a screwdriver on the rocks.""Speaker 1: One screwdriver, Coming right up. ( He mixes the drink. ) Here you are, Sir.""Speaker 2: It was around one thirty in the morning. I guess I didn't fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind. I just couldn't stop thinking about them.""Speaker 1: That's normal after a tense work evening. Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either. Once, I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend. That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later.""Speaker 2: Stop complaining, Ok?""Speaker 1: No wonder you are named shopaholic.""Speaker 2: No, I am not a shopaholic, But a super shopaholic. And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags.""Speaker 2: Things were different this time. I sat by a math genius.""Speaker 1: Huh? You mean you snuck a peek at his test?""Speaker 2: B :: Come on! I just took a glance.""Speaker 2: If I had chance again, I'd major in English. You're good at language.""Speaker 1: That's what my parents want me to do.""Speaker 2: You should take their advice. They know what's best for you. But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun, While I spend all my time doing reading and writing.""Speaker 1: But if you go to university, You'll still have time for fun.""Speaker 2: Hm, What you say makes sense. But you know, I still have to ask my parents for pocket money, And I hate to do so at this age.""Speaker 2: Don't your relatives visit other relatives?""Speaker 1: Yes, But Americans never visit without calling in advance, And they almost never stay overnight.""Speaker 2: I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families.""Speaker 2: Ok, Here are your tickets in Row 13.""Speaker 1: I think they are too far from the stage. I want two in row 6.""Speaker 2: Sure they are.""Speaker 1: Who's winning?""Speaker 2: We are, 27 to 26.""Speaker 1: Really? I thought that they'd been killing us by now.""Speaker 2: No. But my husband smokes 20 or more a day.""Speaker 1: When did you begin to smoke?""Speaker 2: I had my first cigarette when I was 17.""Speaker 1: Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking?""Speaker 2: Of course not! We built a snowman, Some snow dogs and one big snow fort. We went sliding on the nice hill. It was a real work out. At noon, We had the most special winter picnic outside. Fortunately, We got it all on a video tape. You must come with us next time. I bet you will love it.""Speaker 2: Where is Stanley? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV, Wasn't it?""Speaker 1: If it were up to Stanley, We'd have the wedding in the ETV! He loves to sing.""Speaker 2: Then I bet he's really good!""Speaker 2: Yes. It's a birthday present from my husband!""Speaker 1: Well, You are lucky to have such a considerate husband. Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married.""Speaker 2: He'll come out with surprises. Just wait and see. Look at that woman, With the white chiffon!""Speaker 1: She's chic, Isn't she?""Speaker 2: Yes. I like the dress. It must be the latest fashion. Look, The hem has lowered, And the waist narrowed.""Speaker 2: Oh... I don't know.""Speaker 1: I feel terrible, I really didn't mean to knock you over. My tire, Just exploded, And I lost control of my bike. Really, It was an accident. Please accept my apologies.""Speaker 2: Oh, Wait a second, You seem really familiar, I think I know you from somewhere.""Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we have met somewhere before. That's right! We met at Aaron's place last weekend! What a coincidence! But anyway, I'm glad to see that you're not too badly hurt, And I should probably get going. I have a nine o 'clock meeting.""Speaker 2: Ouch! My ankle! I think it's broken! You can't just leave me like this! Are you calling an ambulance?""Speaker 2: Good for you! You'Ve got new curtains too. That's a very nice shade of blue. This sofa is very comfortable. I could sit on it all day!""Speaker 1: Do you like my carpet? Be honest! Tell me what you really think.""Speaker 2: Then what are the Westerners fit for?""Speaker 2: He took the picture when he was only 21 years old.""Speaker 2: Vince says he can't afford anybody else. We're got to come through.""Speaker 1: Do you think we'll make it?""Speaker 2: Let me have a look. Everything I do I do it for you、 Unchained melody、 My heart will go on. Oh, And I'd like to try Everything I do I do it for you.""Speaker 1: Let me play it for you.""Speaker 2: Is it easy to locate it?""Speaker 1: It's very easy. Here it is. Ready? Excellent! You are a good singer. You sing the bass so well.""Speaker 2: I used to be a better singer. I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time. It's your turn.""Speaker 1: I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging, First in Chinese then in English.""Speaker 2: I have had disagreement with every director. I'Ve worked with. We'Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from. We got on very well and I hope to work with her again. I enjoyed making the movie very much.""Speaker 1: Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you?""Speaker 2: Ok, Got it. I will call you sometime next week.""Speaker 1: Fine.""Speaker 2: It's time to go. Bye, Ella. Hope to see you soon.""Speaker 2: Well, It would be spacious and located next to a park, Because a nice view is important to me.""Speaker 1: How many rooms would it have?""Speaker 2: I'd want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each, And one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite. I'd also want a large living room and kitchen connectedt.""Speaker 1: How many bedrooms would your dream home have?""Speaker 2: January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays.""Speaker 1: Yes, Maybe another choice might be better.""Speaker 2: I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains.""Speaker 1: Thank you for thinking of that.""Speaker 2: Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.""Speaker 1: That is a good idea.""Speaker 2: Why? That's good news, But no one knows it?""Speaker 2: I might be able to help...""Speaker 1: I'm sure you have great connections.""Speaker 2: We'd like to open another restaurant... With you as the head chef and manager...""Speaker 1: Really? You have that much faith in me? And Giovanni agreed to it? Does he know who I am?""Speaker 2: Yes. But you know him. He's just worried that you're not Italian...""Speaker 1: He's prejudiced, Isn't he?""Speaker 2: I think I like classical music better.""Speaker 2: No, You can't. The bench is wet, Too.""Speaker 1: It's not raining, Darling. The bench isn't wet.""Speaker 2: Can't you see a notice on the bench?""Speaker 1: Yes, I can.""Speaker 2: What does the notice say?""Speaker 2: Why they hold a flour war?""Speaker 1: They got rice, Flour and oil as presents, While the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card.""Speaker 2: They are not feeling satisfied?""Speaker 1: It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan, And it is no use for them at all, Because they don't cook by themselves.""Speaker 2: My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer, And I suppose you dance often.""Speaker 1: Me? Oh, No. In fact, I only took up dancing quite recently.""Speaker 2: Oh, Really? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well.""Speaker 1: I'm glad you say so. You dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got you as a partner.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments. It's just you are a good leader. Do you like the foxtrot and tango?""Speaker 1: Yes. And what dances do you like best?""Speaker 2: Yes, On the cancer ward. And Taylor was there. He walked right by me and didn't even see me.""Speaker 1: Maybe he was just visiting someone.""Speaker 2: Oh, Great. That's just my luck! I hate those arty movies.""Speaker 1: Well, Too bad. So, What foreign film won an Oscar in 1993?""Speaker 2: Oh, Please! I have no idea.""Speaker 2: Haha. Don't worry, Betty. So tell me, What's the latest gossip?

And now I can break this to you. Fanny is moving.""Speaker 2: That's true.""Speaker 1: Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already?""Speaker 2: I don't know.""Speaker 1: I thought you knew where we get off at.""Speaker 2: I wasn't really paying attention. I think we missed our stop.""Speaker 1: Seriously?""Speaker 2: Yeah, We definitely missed our stop.""Speaker 1: That's the last time I get on a bus with you.""Speaker 2: My God! I actually checked them one by one. How could this be?""Speaker 1: Calm down! It is useless to act like that. Can we find some solutions?""Speaker 2: What kind of solution can I have now? I nearly go crazy now.""Speaker 1: But we still have to find one. Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not?""Speaker 2: That's why I can profit from it!""Speaker 1: You're going tore-sell it on eBay Taiwan?""Speaker 2: You bet. Ebay Taiwan doesn't have it! And bidding will start at two thousand NT. This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans...""Speaker 2: No.Sir. If only you check out before 15:00.""Speaker 2: Why not?""Speaker 1: Can't you see the notes here?""Speaker 2: I'm sorry. I can't. What does the note say.""Speaker 1: It says 'No smoking'.""Speaker 2: According to your schedule, You will visit the Times Company, Including its office building, Workshops and stores, In the morning from 8: 30 to 11.""Speaker 2: It's two yuan.""Speaker 1: Which way do we go for the northern line?""Speaker 2: Just go through the number eight to ticket barrier over there.

We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square. It's perfect for people busy with office work.

You can get a motorcycle on one condition.""Speaker 1: What's that?""Speaker 2: You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month.""Speaker 1: And after that?""Speaker 2: Oh, Nothing much really.

Oh, Amy, Let's try something new!""Speaker 1: Well, What do you have in mind?""Speaker 2: How about the Mongolian hot pot?""Speaker 1: Oh, It's too spicy for me. Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb? It was so spicy my eyes teared up!""Speaker 2: Maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time. You can choose the non-spicy soup base.""Speaker 1: Sounds great. Do they serve noodles? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well.""Speaker 2: It is. But there is no Frans Smith here. Do you know which department he works in?""Speaker 1: The accounts department, I think.""Speaker 2: It's truly exciting to work in newly emerging unified market. Brussels will be center of the new market in the continent.""Speaker 1: What are you looking for in your next job?""Speaker 2: My experience in my last job showed that I have the talent to motivate people. It could be seen from the low absentee rate in my team. I want to continue that kind of contribution and to further develop this potential.""Speaker 1: What is your career objective?""Speaker 2: I know. And they're spending enough on the plane tickets to Texas!""Speaker 1: Speaking of plane tickets, Don't forget to check on the reservations!""Speaker 2: I'm afraid you can't, Ma'am. We accept only traveler's checks and credit cards.""Speaker 1: Ok. How about this card then?""Speaker 2: Tell me where it happened and how.""Speaker 1: Yes, It was just when I was walking in the park. I saw some children with a newspaper.""Speaker 2: That happens often these days. Well, Please fill in this Report of Theft.""Speaker 2: Yes. One bedroom is for my wife and I. There's another for our daughter. My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room, But I'd like to make it into a study. Our daughter is also keen on making it a study, So that's probably what will happen.""Speaker 1: What's the kitchen like? I know both you and your wife like to cook.""Speaker 2: Oh, We've got plenty of time.""Speaker 1: We haven't. Hurry up!""Speaker 2: All right. Let's go.""Speaker 2: Yes. I'Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops.""Speaker 1: That's right. They tastes so good! We eat them with mint sauce. Have you every tried them?""Speaker 2: Yes, I have. I tried them when I visited your country last year. I thought they were very tasty. Can you cook them?""Speaker 1: I certainly can. If I can get some from the butcher's, I'll cook them for you.""Speaker 2: Of course not. I really did lose track of time.""Speaker 1: Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late?""Speaker 2: Yeah, You did. I just forgot to call.""Speaker 1: It doesn't matter, You should have called and let me know.""Speaker 2: That's true. My bad for not calling.""Speaker 1: If you do this again, Don't even bother coming home.""Speaker 2: You're going to kick me out over this?""Speaker 2: No, I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean, If I look back on your previous presentations, This is a huge improvement.""Speaker 1: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on PowerPoint.""Speaker 2: And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions.""Speaker 2: And, As well as being a pleasure to work with, You'Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects.""Speaker 1: It will be hard to say good-bye. This office has become like a second home to me.""Speaker 2: And must I go back to school?""Speaker 1: No, You needn't do that. You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes.""Speaker 2: But Dad, I should be working full-time at my age. I'm nearly 17.""Speaker 1: You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams. You have to take a job and study.""Speaker 2: What else I'Ve got to do? Join the army?""Speaker 2: You really shouldn't write it down. You should memorize it. You can change it to a more convenient number if you like.""Speaker 1: Ok, I've entered my PIN. There are several options on the screen. I guess I just choose which service I want, Don't I?""Speaker 2: Yes. Choose the service you need to use. If you choose to withdraw money, The machine will ask you how much you want.""Speaker 2: That's a big mistake, You should always have a good breakfast. You will not run your car without fuel, And yet you expect your body to work without food.""Speaker 1: I never thought about it that way.""Speaker 2: I bet you eat a large evening meal, Then sit and watch TV or read a book. Then instead of burning off your energy, Your body stores it as fat.""Speaker 1: Oh doctor, I feel so foolish.""Speaker 2: Shall I see you on Friday morning?""Speaker 1: That's not good for me at all. It'll have to be another time.""Speaker 2: We must find some time to read report.""Speaker 1: I know. I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon.""Speaker 2: That's all right. Then see you on Friday afternoon.""Speaker 2: I'm actually here on business.""Speaker 1: I see and what do you do for a living?""Speaker 2: I'm an IT salesman.""Speaker 1: That sounds like a good job.""Speaker 2: It's very interesting actually.""Speaker 1: Ok, Well enjoy the rest of your stay here.""Speaker 2: My younger brother. He suffers from a bad cold.""Speaker 1: What symptoms does he have?""Speaker 2: Fever and a bad cough.""Speaker 1: I got it. Don't worry, Just a common cold.""Speaker 2: What kind of medicine does he need?""Speaker 1: Patulin will do.""Speaker 2: How many pills for each time?""Speaker 1: Six per day, And two after each meal.""Speaker 2: Thank you very much.""Speaker 2: We are all going to have great interviews. What are some things that we need to remember in an interview?""Speaker 1: I think that we should make sure that our looks are the best they can be.""Speaker 2: Right, And what about our friendliness and attitude?""Speaker 1: Yes, And being friendly and having a good attitude also help me relax.""Speaker 2: Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview?""Speaker 2: No, Not yet.

I used to be an interpreter.""Speaker 1: Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work?""Speaker 2: Okay... What makes you say that? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance. Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude?""Speaker 1: Yeah, His attitude is great, But he's really unreliable.

Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes.""Speaker 2: Terrific! It is also a good exercise to keep me fit.""Speaker 1: I give you my word, You must feel refreshed after mountain climbing.""Speaker 2: Like what? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction.""Speaker 1: Well, First of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.""Speaker 2: I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.""Speaker 2: I just did what I should have done.""Speaker 1: You'Ve got a great personality.""Speaker 2: Thank you for your compliments.

You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight, Won't you? Please!""Speaker 2: Have you invested in the stock market before?""Speaker 1: No. This is my first time to buy some. You can see that its historical price data is rising now.""Speaker 2: But that is a little risky, You know.""Speaker 1: Hey! Do you still remember our teacher of economics, Mr. Locker?""Speaker 2: Of course! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst.""Speaker 2: I'm very well, Thank you.

This hotel has a three-star restaurant.""Speaker 1: Well, I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town. Do you have another suggestion?""Speaker 2: Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant. Plus, They have live jazz.""Speaker 1: Gramercy Tavern, Eh? I think I've heard of that before. Call to get us a table, Okay?""Speaker 2: I'm afraid our hotel is fully booked on that night. Is it possible for you to change your reservation date?""Speaker 1: No, I'm afraid not.""Speaker 2: We might have cancellations. Could you call us again some other day?""Speaker 1: Sure, But if you do have any cancellations, Could you let me know as soon as possible?""Speaker 2: I'm very sorry, Sir, But we are unable to do that. We would appreciate it very much if you could call us instead.""Speaker 2: It feels good. Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color? My wife prefers aturtleneck to a V-shaped collar.""Speaker 1: Yes, We do. What size do you want?""Speaker 2: Size one. By the way, What if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn't like it?""Speaker 1: Well, You can always bring it back to us for a full refund.""Speaker 2: Yes, I can adjust to anything.""Speaker 1: That's good.""Speaker 2: I am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid.""Speaker 1: You should very qualified.""Speaker 2: Yes, Please. My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments.""Speaker 1: Sorry, Just a moment. The name is Caxton...""Speaker 2: No, It's Caxton.""Speaker 1: Fine, I've got that. And your company is...""Speaker 2: Rosedale Investments.""Speaker 1: Could you spell that, Please?""Speaker 2: It's R, O,S, E,D, A, L, E.""Speaker 2: Is it in the other pocket?""Speaker 1: No, It is not here. Damn it! I'm going to have to buy another ticket.""Speaker 2: Let's go to the inquiry desk first to check whether anyone has got it and turned it in.""Speaker 2: Well, How about our own hotel restaurant? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating.""Speaker 1: That's a good idea, Except I want to go out, Not stay in. Something else, Maybe?""Speaker 2: Well, How about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, With great food and music.""Speaker 1: That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?""Speaker 2: I'm not ready to get off the phone with you.""Speaker 1: There are other things I need to take care of.""Speaker 2: What is it that you need to do?""Speaker 1: Please don't be nosey.""Speaker 2: I'm not being nosey, It's just a question.""Speaker 1: You don't need to worry about that.""Speaker 2: That was mean to say.""Speaker 1: I am very sorry, But I must go.""Speaker 2: I'd like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.""Speaker 1: I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, Even during office hours, I wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.""Speaker 2: Other company rules also need your attention.""Speaker 2: No, Thank you. They are already tagged with my name and address.""Speaker 1: You are allowed an additional two carry-on items.""Speaker 2: Good, I have my backpack and my camera tripod.""Speaker 1: I see. All carry-on items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin.""Speaker 2: Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin.""Speaker 1: You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items.""Speaker 2: I'm afraid you can't.""Speaker 1: I talked with the manager over the phone and he told me I can have itreissued because I have a copy of my lost ticket.""Speaker 2: It's very kind of you.""Speaker 1: Would you like to order now or wait for a while?""Speaker 2: Might I suggest a Mac?""Speaker 1: Okay.
